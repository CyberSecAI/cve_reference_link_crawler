Debian Bug     : 1008010 1016978 1055852

Several vulnerabilities have been found in frr, the FRRouting suite of
internet protocols. An attacker could craft packages to trigger buffer
overflows with the possibility to gain remote code execution, buffer
overreads, crashes or trick the software to enter an infinite loop.

CVE-2022-26125

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.

CVE-2022-26126

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    the use of strdup with a non-zero-terminated binary string in
    isis_nb_notifications.c.

CVE-2022-26127

    A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin
    function in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-26128

    A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin
    function in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-26129

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    wrong checks on the subtlv length in the functions, parse_hello_subtlv,
    parse_ihu_subtlv, and parse_update_subtlv in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-37035

    An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) 8.3. In
    bgp_notify_send_with_data() and bgp_process_packet() in bgp_packet.c,
    there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could
    lead to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure by sending
    crafted BGP packets. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

CVE-2023-38406

    bgpd/bgp_flowspec.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.4.3 mishandles an nlri
    length of zero, aka a "flowspec overflow."

CVE-2023-38407

    bgpd/bgp_label.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.5 attempts to read beyond
    the end of the stream during labeled unicast parsing.

CVE-2023-46752

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. It mishandles
    malformed MP_REACH_NLRI data, leading to a crash.

CVE-2023-46753

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. A crash can
    occur for a crafted BGP UPDATE message without mandatory attributes,
    e.g., one with only an unknown transit attribute.

CVE-2023-47234

    An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) 8.3. In
    bgp_notify_send_with_data() and bgp_process_packet() in bgp_packet.c,
    there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could
    lead to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure by sending
    crafted BGP packets. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

CVE-2023-47235

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. A crash can
    occur when a malformed BGP UPDATE message with an EOR is processed,
    because the presence of EOR does not lead to a treat-as-withdraw
    outcome.

CVE-2024-31948

    In FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1, an attacker using a malformed Prefix SID
    attribute in a BGP UPDATE packet can cause the bgpd daemon to crash.

CVE-2024-31949

    In FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1, an infinite loop can occur when
    receiving a MP/GR capability as a dynamic capability because malformed
    data results in a pointer not advancing.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.5.1-1.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your frr packages.

The loop condition is `subtlv_len > 2` and `subtlv_len` is updated at the end of the loop (Line 3113: `subtlv_len = subtlv_len - length - 2`).  **The Issue on Loop Condition**: at Line 3113, when we update `subtlv_len`, if `subtlv_len < length + 2`, integer overflow will happen, leading to heap overflows in the next loop iteration. Note that `subtlv_len` and `length` are of `uint8_t`, which makes it easy to overflow, e.g., `subtlv_len=35`, `length=38`... An example output of the address sanitizer can be found below:  ``` 2022/02/05 21:54:53 ISIS: [S48XV-GT1WC][EC 100663311] stream_getc: Attempt to get char out of bounds 2022/02/05 21:54:53 ISIS: [RF6RD-ZCBTC][EC 100663311] &(struct stream): 0x61200000f940, size: 231, getp: 74, endp: 74 ==86437==      #1 0x7fe6ec3a118a in __libc_signal_restore_set /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/signal/../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/internal-signals.h:86:3     #2 0x7fe6ec3a118a in raise /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/signal/../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:48:3     #3 0x7fe6ec380858 in abort /build/glibc-eX1tMB/glibc-2.31/stdlib/abort.c:79:7     #4 0x880f5c in _zlog_assert_failed /home/parallels/myfrr/lib/zlog.c:700:2     #5 0x7f2f6f in stream_getc /home/parallels/myfrr/lib/stream.c     #6 0x63c10c in unpack_tlv_router_cap /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_tlvs.c:3016:10     #7 0x6242a5 in unpack_tlv /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_tlvs.c:4332:10     #8 0x6242a5 in unpack_tlvs /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_tlvs.c:4354:8     #9 0x623ce4 in isis_unpack_tlvs /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_tlvs.c:4385:7     #10 0x5d5b5b in process_lsp /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_pdu.c:940:6     #11 0x5cf009 in isis_handle_pdu /home/parallels/myfrr/isisd/isis_pdu.c:1781:12  ```  **Other Issues**: at Line 3016, Line 3021, Line 3062, Line 3067, and Line 3098, I think we need to use `break` instead of `continue`. Using `continue` will let us miss the update of the loop condition variable at Line 3113.  Please check if my understanding of the code above is correct. If so, I can make a pull request to fix these issues then. |

| **Integer overflow bugs**: Also in the loop shown above, at Line 3043 and Line 3090, when we do the operation `size = length - (size + SUBTLV_SR_BLOCK_SIZE)`, integer overflows often happens, when `length < size + SUBTLV_SR_BLOCK_SIZE`. Both `length` and `size` are of uint8\_t, making the overflow happen frequently...  And I think the following code at Lines 3045 and 3092 should be `stream_forward_getp(s, size)` rather than `stream_forward_getp(s, length)`. Please check... |

| **Heap overflows**: Also in the loop shown above, at Line 3031 and Line 3078, the operation `stream_getl(s)` is valid only when `length = 10` but `length` may be `9`... |

| Hi! Are you fuzzing or auditing manually?  Hi, I am using FRR in one of our projects and trying to test its reliability. You can regard it as a kind of testing.  I carefully went through every problem I found and reported the issue only when I thought it is really a problem. I also tried to propose fixes as I also want to make contributions to FRR's community. |

| Please check PR [#9850](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/9850). I believe most of the reported issues are solved there. Or even all of them. The PR is finished and the code is approved, but unfortunately it breaks some of our tests so it was not merged. I believe the tests could be wrong and should be fixed so it would be great if you look into that. |

| Yeah, so...this is an assertion failure unless I'm reading the issue wrong. We push a stream buffer until a point where automatic bounds checks kick in and terminate the program to *prevent* a buffer overflow. Yet this is labeled as a buffer overflow and assigned a CVE score of 7.8.  [@00xc](https://github.com/00xc) [@whichbug](https://github.com/whichbug) can one of you guys clarify the situation here? |

I guess the problem is that the assertion failures are caused by potential overflows. The CVE score could be reduced. |

| There are no potential overflows. The potential for overflow is eliminated by the assert. That's the whole point of the assert, that's why we put it there.  Since it sounds like you agree with my assessment, can you work with the CVE people to fix the CVE you filed? Frankly I don't even think this deserves a CVE but if you are set on filing them, please make sure you accurately report the problem.  So that you have some insight into what happens when the CVE process is used, we now have people from Debian emailing us regarding the high-severity CVEs you've filed for these issues. So now that I've found that this one isn't accurate, now I have to go through and cross check each of your reports against the CVEs you've filed to make sure they're actually accurate.  On that topic, usually when you file CVEs against projects, it's expected that you work with the people who run the project to agree on a characterization of what is going to be filed and when it's going to be disclosed. Unless we missed some communication from you, you haven't done that, which is inconsiderate to us. We're volunteers, not a major company selling a product. We aren't going to sue you to prevent you from filing CVEs. We have an established process for reporting security vulnerabilities that's in the project README. Your research is appreciated but please, follow common practices, spend the time to reach out and work with us regarding reporting and disclosure. |

| On that topic, usually when you file CVEs against projects, it's expected that you work with the people who run the project to agree on a characterization of what is going to be filed and when it's going to be disclosed.  I don't think this was directed to me, but to be clear, I did not request the CVE, I just tried to make everyone aware. For what is worth, I updated [our downstream CVSS score](https://www.suse.com/es-es/security/cve/CVE-2022-26125.html) for this issue accordingly. Hopefully MITRE will do the same soon.  Frankly I don't even think this deserves a CVE  Not that my personal opinion matters much here, but a remotely reachable assertion (i.e. remote DoS) seems severe enough, although I might be missing something. |
