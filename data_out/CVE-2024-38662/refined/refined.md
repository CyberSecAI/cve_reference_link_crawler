Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that BPF programs attached to tracepoints could trigger locking rule violations by performing `map_delete` operations on `sockmap` or `sockhash` maps. This was not an intended use case.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lock Inversion:** BPF programs were able to delete elements from `sockmap` and `sockhash` maps without proper authorization, which led to lock inversion deadlocks, as identified by the fix in commit `ff9105993240`.
- **Unintended Access:** Tracepoint-attached BPF programs were able to perform operations (map deletion) on socket-related maps (`sockmap`, `sockhash`), which was not the intended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Locking Rule Violations:** Exploitation leads to locking rule violations, specifically a lock inversion deadlock, which causes system instability.
- **System Instability:** The locking violations can cause the system to become unstable and potentially crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **BPF Programs:** Malicious or improperly crafted BPF programs attached to tracepoints are used as the attack vector.
- **Map Deletion:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of the `map_delete` operation on `sockmap` or `sockhash` maps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **BPF Program Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to create and load BPF programs.
- **Tracepoint Attachment:** The attacker needs to be able to attach the BPF program to a tracepoint.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix restricts `map_delete` operations to only those BPF programs that are also permitted to `map_update` on `sockmap` or `sockhash` maps. This is enforced by the verifier.
- Specifically, the `may_update_sockmap` function in `kernel/bpf/verifier.c` is modified to check for `BPF_FUNC_map_delete_elem` in addition to `BPF_FUNC_map_update_elem`.
- The check `func_id != BPF_FUNC_map_update_elem && func_id != BPF_FUNC_map_delete_elem` in `may_update_sockmap` prevents non-authorized programs from performing these operations, and the check is also extended for `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS`.
- Additionally, `check_map_func_compatibility` function is updated to remove the check against `BPF_FUNC_map_delete_elem` for `BPF_MAP_TYPE_SOCKMAP` and `BPF_MAP_TYPE_SOCKHASH` because the restriction is already enforced by `may_update_sockmap`.
- The vulnerability was identified by syzkaller.
- The fix was introduced in the upstream commit `98e948fb60d41447fd8d2d0c3b8637fc6b6dc26d`.
- The fix is included in the stable kernel branches via the commits `b81e1c5a3c70398cf76631ede63a03616ed1ba3c`, `000a65bf1dc04fb2b65e2abf116f0bc0fc2ee7b1`, `11e8ecc5b86037fec43d07b1c162e233e131b1d9`, `6693b172f008846811f48a099f33effc26068e1e` and `29467edc23818dc5a33042ffb4920b49b090e63d`
