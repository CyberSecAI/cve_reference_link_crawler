Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "ElementsReady Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `_id` parameter of the plugin's "Info Box" widget is not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be injected and saved in the database. These scripts execute when a user accesses a page containing the injected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into pages.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, XSS vulnerabilities can often be used in conjunction with other exploits to escalate privileges or perform actions on behalf of the user who views the infected page.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers can use XSS to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive user information. They can also manipulate the content of the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authenticated Users:** The attack vector is through authenticated users with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Plugin Setting Modification:** An attacker with contributor access can modify the "Info Box" widget settings of the plugin and inject malicious script into the `_id` parameter, which will then be rendered on pages that use this widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with a minimum of Contributor-level privileges.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker must be able to access the WordPress admin panel where they can edit page content with the vulnerable widget.
