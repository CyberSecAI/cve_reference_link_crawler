{
  "CVE": "CVE-2021-44228",
  "extracted_data": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the JNDI features in Apache Log4j2 not protecting against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "JNDI features in Log4j2 can be exploited to execute arbitrary code by controlling log messages or parameters.",
       "Versions of Log4j2 prior to 2.15.0 are vulnerable. Specifically, log4j-core is vulnerable but log4net and other Apache Logging services are not affected. ",
       "log4j 1.x is not vulnerable to this issue as it does not have JNDI lookup functionality"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attackers can exploit this by controlling log messages or log message parameters to execute arbitrary code.",
      "Network access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need to have the ability to control the log messages or log message parameters of the Log4j2 implementation."
