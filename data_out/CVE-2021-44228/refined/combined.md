Subject: CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not protect against
 attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints

Severity: critical

Description:

Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.

In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property "log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups" to “true” or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html>) protects against remote code execution by defaulting "com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase" and "com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase" to "false".

This issue was discovered by Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team.

# Protect yourself, before you break yourself... ;)

## Description:

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0, this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

## Usage and explanation:

* Demonstration of scanning for `Log4j` vulnerability
* + NOTE: For advanced users!
* Manual installing the extension for BurpSuite

To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

To resolve issues with security scanners detecting **log4j 1.x dependencies**, please **update to PaperCut MF or NG version 22.0.8 or later**, which includes:

* Removal of all log4j 1.x dependencies from the MF and NG products.
* Removal of the legacy Mac client (which contained lingering log4j 1.x files).
* Payment Gateway module version 219 - updated (Jan 27th) version of the Payment Gateway module to install **only** required if you are currently using version 207, 210, 213 or 214 of the Payment Gateway (see the ‘Do I need to upgrade the Payment Gateway module?’ question in the [FAQs](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Log4Shell-CVE-2021-44228#faqs)).

PaperCut is aware of the RCE vulnerability in the Apache Log4j library also known as Log4Shell or [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228). This issue has been classified by the Apache Logging security team as a critical severity issue.

This issue can lead to remote code execution or information disclosure on the system running software containing the log4j component where a malicious actor can control any string that is logged. At this point in time our initial triage shows that only PaperCut MF and PaperCut NG have dependencies on the Apache Log4j component.

This Knowledge Base article outlines the impact of this vulnerability on PaperCut products. This is a rapidly evolving situation, we recommend that you revisit this page often for the most current information.

## Recommendations

![info icon](https://cdn1.papercut.com/web/img/icon/alert-info-blue-icon.svg)
info

**Please note that these recommendations are listed here for historical purposes. Our current recommendation is to upgrade to PaperCut NG or MF version 22.0.8 or later, which includes the full removal of log4j 1.x dependencies.**
## Application Server and Site Server Fix

If you are running PaperCut NG or MF version 21.0.0 or later, we highly recommend applying the latest maintenance release (21.2.5).

There have been attacks developed which can circumvent the config change in Option 1, so to close these additional attack vectors we recommend Option 2 - which is that anyone using PaperCut NG/MF 21.x should upgrade to the latest available maintenance release (21.2.5) - through whichever method you normally use to perform upgrades.

We do believe that applying Option 1 (Mitigate via Configuration Change) is the most immediate (but temporary) solution. This fix protects against some cases of exploitation being discussed online. This solution involves a simple configuration change that will effectively mitigate the vulnerability in the affected software, rather than apply a full update to an existing PaperCut NG/MF installation. This change only involves a restart of the application server and minimal impact on the operation of your print solution.

As soon as you are able to - we recommend upgrading to 21.2.5.

### Option 1 - Mitigate via Configuration Change

***Only use this option if you’re unable to immediately upgrade to 21.2.5***.

**Windows:**

1. [Stop](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#windows) the PaperCut application server (or Site Server).
2. Navigate to the `/server/bin/win` folder.
3. Open the `service.conf` file in that folder for editing (you will need to open it as Administrator).
4. Find the line that looks like this: `wrapper.java.additional.21=-Dpc-reserved=X`
5. Replace it with this: `wrapper.java.additional.21=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
6. Save the file.
7. [Start](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#windows) the PaperCut application server (or Site Server).

**macOS:**

1. [Stop](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#macos) the PaperCut application server (or Site Server).
2. Navigate to the `/server/custom` folder.
3. Open the `launch-app-server.conf` file for editing.
4. Add the following line to the end of the file:
    `PC_CUSTOM_SERVER_ARG=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
5. Save the file.
6. [Start](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#macos) the PaperCut application server (or Site Server).

**Linux:**

1. [Stop](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#linux) the PaperCut application server.
2. Navigate to the `/server/bin/linux-x64` folder (or the linux-i686 or linux-common folder, depending on distro).
3. Open the `app-monitor.conf` file in that folder for editing.
4. Find the line that looks like this: `wrapper.java.additional.21=-Dpc-reserved=X`
5. Replace it with this: `wrapper.java.additional.21=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`
6. Save the file.
7. [Start](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/StoppingAndStartingPaperCutServices#linux) the PaperCut application server.

### Option 2 - Upgrade to PaperCut NG/MF version 21.2.5

1. Upgrade to version 21.2.5 through your usual upgrade procedures, as soon as possible.

## Release Station Fix

6. Repeat the steps above for the `pc-release-cmd-line.sh` file.
7. Restart the release station.

### Option 2 - Upgrade to PaperCut NG/MF version 21.2.5

1. Apply the configuration change listed in Option 1 (Release Station fix) above to mitigate the most serious vulnerability.
2. Schedule an upgrade to version 21.2.5 through your usual upgrade procedures.

Once you have upgraded to a PaperCut server version containing the patched libraries, delete and redeploy all release stations using the release station package from the server.

## FAQs

Q Is there any impact from applying this fix?

No - there is no impact to PaperCut products. All products will continue to work with zero impact.

Q I have applied the 21.2.5 maintenance release, but I don’t see the config changes applied. Am I protected?

Yes - in the above recommendations, you can apply an immediate config change (Option 1) which involves updating config files with the `formatMsgNoLookups` string. The preferred method, which is to install 21.2.5, actually includes log4j version 2.17.1 which includes the fix internally, so you will not see the Option 1 config changes after applying the maintenance release. This is expected behavior.

Q I am running the PaperCut User client and see that it’s using log4j 2.x - why does the table above say that the User Client is not impacted?

Good catch! Due to the way our build system works, the User Client actually ships with log4j 1.x and log4j 2.x libraries. The User Client in practice only uses the log4j 1.x libs, so is not impacted by the vulnerability. We do not use the log4j 2.x libs in the User Client - which means it is not vulnerable to attack.

In order to completely remove the log4j 1.x libraries, you’ll need to update to PaperCut NG/MF version 21.2.8.

Q Do I need to upgrade the Payment Gateway module?

1. Check the Payment Gateway version that you have installed - head into your Application Server file system: `[MF/NG installation directory]/server/lib-ext` and open the file `ext-payment-gateway-version.txt`.
2. Check the line with `version-build=`

* **IF** you are using a gateway with a build number 207 or later (but earlier than 219) then you are **not** at risk from the vulnerability, however versions of log4j 2.x are included (but not used) in this build, since November 2021. To be completely safe (and to avoid vulnerability scanners flagging this impact) we recommend upgrading to the latest version of the Payment Gateway (219), as detailed through Step 2 of the [Setting up the Payment Gateway module](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/SettingupthePaymentGateway#step-2-download-and-install-the-payment-gateway-module) article. Version 219 removes the unnecessary log4j files from the gateway installation.
* **IF** you are using a gateway with a build number lower than 207, then you are **not** at risk from the vulnerability, and log4j 2.x libraries are **not** included in the gateway module.

***Note***\*: Version 213 of the Payment Gateway module includes log4j version 2.16. Version 214 of the Payment Gateway module includes log4j version 2.17. Version 219 removes the Payment Gateway installation log4j jar files entirely, and relies on the log4j version installed with the MF/NG Application Server.\*

***Note***\*: This is completely independent from the Application Server version - so even if you are running version 21.2.5 (patched) of the App Server, if you are running a Payment Gateway module version between 207 and 214, we recommend applying the Payment Gateway upgrade too. Alternatively if you are using an earlier **non**-impacted version of the App Server (e.g. version 20.x or earlier) and you are using a Payment Gateway module version between 207 and 214, we also recommend applying the Payment Gateway upgrade but you do **not** need to upgrade the Application Server.\*

Q I see that some PaperCut products use Apache Log4j 1.x, isn’t that also vulnerable to CVE-2021-4104?

No. PaperCut products are not vulnerable to this issue. Version 1.x of Apache Log4j did not include the JNDI lookup functionality that is at the root of Log4Shell. [CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104) has been raised to differentiate these issues. The [write up by Synk](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-LOG4J-2316893) indicates that there is a possibility of a similar style of compromise if the `JMSAppender` library is present and an attacker can manipulate the `TopicBindingName` or `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName`. PaperCut software does not use `JMSAppender` or reference the `TopicBindingName` or `TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName`. This means there is no known vector to manipulate this vulnerability in PaperCut software. The only other scenario would be if an attacker would have write access to configuration files in order to update the Log4j configuration and this would require an attacker to already be able to access the system.

**Note**: PaperCut NG/MF version 21.2.8 now completely removes any log4j 1.x dependencies. Please install this latest version if you are concerned about vulnerability scanners flagging the log4j 1.x libraries. After upgrading, you will need to manually remove the legacy Mac client since it is not automatically removed. e.g: C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\mac\legacy\PCClient.app

Q Why does my vulnerability scanner show Log4j (e.g. log4j 1.x) as being vulnerable on a version listed as ‘not impacted’ in the table above?

* PaperCut NG/MF version 21.2.8 completely removes any log4j 1.x dependencies (apart from the legacy Mac client). Please install this latest version if you are concerned about vulnerability scanners flagging the log4j 1.x libraries. After upgrading, you will need to manually remove the legacy Mac client since it is not automatically removed. e.g: C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\mac\legacy\PCClient.app
* PaperCut NG/MF version 22.0.8 completely removes the legacy Mac client so that this removal doesn’t have to be done manually.

**Note:** If you have a very old installation of PaperCut which has been upgraded and upgraded over the years, it may still have the old ’net’ control module (which allowed you to monitor internet bandwidth). This product was announced end-of-life in 2011, and has no functionality in more recent versions of PaperCut (since 2012). The ’net’ folder can safely be removed (take a server backup just in case). Note that this path is an example and your installation path may differ:

* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\providers\net\\*

Otherwise, if you are wanting to remove any 1.x log4j files (even if they are not vulnerable) because they are getting picked up by security scanners, you can potentially remove them based on the below. Note that the paths are examples and your installation path may differ.

If you are not using the Ricoh remote operation tools, or Sharp configuration tools (or if you don’t have Ricoh or Sharp devices at all), you can safely remove these files:

* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\providers\hardware\ricoh\sdkj\403046912\log4j-1.2.13.jar
* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\providers\hardware\ricoh\remote-operation-client\lib\log4j-1.2.17.jar
* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\server\deployment\sharp\lib\sharp-configuration-tool-all.jar
* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\providers\hardware\ricoh\sdkj\deprecated\403046656\log4j-1.2.13.jar

If you are not using the macOS User Client Software, you can remove these files:

* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\mac\PCClient.app\Contents\Java\log4j-1.2.17.jar
* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\mac\legacy\PCClient.app\Contents\Resources\Java\log4j-1.2.13.jar

If you are not using the Linux User Client Software, you can remove this file:

* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\linux\lib\log4j-1.2.17.jar

If you are not using the Windows User Client Software, you can remove this file:

* C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\win\lib\log4j-1.2.17.jar

Please note that the 21.2.8 release of PaperCut MF/NG now removes these dependencies on log4j 1.x, and version 22.0.8 additionally removes the legacy Mac client.

Q Why does my vulnerability scanner show my Payment Gateway install as vulnerable (in the lib-ext folder)?

If you have upgraded the Payment Gateway (see questions above) you may have multiple versions of log4j\*.jar files in the `[MF or NG install]/server/lib-ext/` directory. If this is the case, you can safely remove the older versions which are no longer needed.

*Note that you may need to stop the PaperCut Application Server service to successfully remove the older files*.

You can safely delete instances of the log4j .jar files. Alternatively if you install version 219 of the Payment Gateway module on Windows (see the Payment Gateway question above), it will automatically remove the unnecessary jar files. If you’re wanting to remove these manually, these can be safely removed:

* log4j-api-2.16.0.jar
* log4j-core-2.16.0.jar
* log4j-slf4j-impl-2.16.0.jar
* log4j-api-2.13.3.jar
* log4j-core-2.13.3.jar
* log4j-slf4j-impl-2.13.3.jar
* log4j-api-2.17.0.jar
* log4j-core-2.17.0.jar
* log4j-slf4j-impl-2.17.0.jar

Q I have the latest version of Java - doesn’t that protect me against Log4Shell?

No. There have been [examples of executing this under any version of java](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1470361495405875200). The only way to prevent this issue in PaperCut Products is to apply the recommendations outlined in this knowledge base article.

Q Is PaperCut affected by the Log4j 1.2 SocketServer vulnerability (CVE-2019-17571)?

A vulnerability was discovered (originally in 2019) in the SocketServer functionality of Log4j. This has been documented officially on the NIST site here: [CVE-2019-17571](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17571).

This vulnerability requires the Apache Log4j component to be configured to listen for logging events on a socket. PaperCut Products do **not** use this feature of Log4j and as such the vulnerability CVE-2019-17571 **does not affect PaperCut Products**.

Please see our [Known Issue PO-693](https://www.papercut.com/support/known-issues/?id=po-693#ng) for more information on this.

Q Is PaperCut affected by CVE-2021-45046?

Yes. We became aware of this issue on the morning of the 15th of December AEST (see here for info: [CVE-2021-45046](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)). This new issue is currently only rated moderate severity( CVSS: 3.7 ) and would result in a Denial of Service to the PaperCut MF/NF Application or Site Servers in certain circumstances. Due to the severity of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) **we strongly recommend that you do not wait to apply the mitigation for Log4Shell**.

**Please note**: We have addressed this vulnerability in the maintenance release - PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.3 (which uses log4j 2.16).

Q Is PaperCut affected by CVE-2021-45105?

Yes. This vulnerability has been raised online - see [details on CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105). This vulnerability is present in log4j 2.16 (used by PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.3).

**Please note**: We have addressed this vulnerability in the maintenance release - PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.4 (which uses log4j 2.17).

Q What is the difference between the MF/NG versions relating to log4j fixes?

| **Version** | **Contents** | **Log4j version** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.3 | Resolves CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 | log4j 2.16 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.4 | Resolves CVE-2021-45105 (and the previous two vulnerabilities) | log4j 2.17 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.5 | Resolves CVE-2021-44832 (and the previous three vulnerabilities) | log4j 2.17.1 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.6 | Unintentionally includes log4j 2.17.0. We are looking to replace this with a 21.2.7 build asap which will include log4j 2.17.1. See the [known issue](https://www.papercut.com/support/known-issues/?id=PO-785#ng) about this. | log4j 2.17.0 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.7 | Includes all the fixes in 21.2.6 and corrects the log4j version in use | log4j 2.17.1 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.8 | Includes all the fixes in 21.2.7 and **removes** all dependencies on log4j 1.x libraries | log4j 2.17.1 |
| PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.9 and .10 | Includes all the fixes in 21.2.8 and resolves the [Spring4Shell vulnerability](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Spring4Shell) | log4j 2.17.1 |

Q Are any PaperCut products affected by CVE-2021-44832?

Security researchers have flagged that log4j version 2.17 and earlier can have a remote exploitation vulnerability enabled \*if\* an attacker is able to edit the log4j config files.

The relevant configuration is not present in any PaperCut products, and an attacker would therefore need file write access (i.e. Administrator level access) to a site’s PaperCut server in order to make the necessary changes and restart the server. As an attacker in this position must already have high level access to the customer environment in order to enable the vulnerability, we consider this a very low risk for PaperCut customers.

**Please note**: We have addressed this vulnerability in the latest maintenance release - PaperCut MF/NG version 21.2.5 (which uses log4j 2.17.1).

Q Why has the Ricoh SDK/J installer been removed from the PaperCut MF installation?

As per the release note with 21.2.6, we have now removed Ricoh SDK/J v2 (which has been deprecated) from the MF installs on Windows, Linux and macOS [PO-727]. This deprecated (Ricoh deprecated SDK/J a while ago) version was getting flagged by vulnerability scanners, so the client package has now been removed from the server installation. For customers still running SDK/J machines needing the SDK/J package, this can be downloaded [here](https://cdn.papercut.com/web/products/ng-mf/installers/mf/21.x/pc-ricoh-sdkj-6.0.9.zip).

Q How is papercut affected by the following security issues that affect log4j 1.x?

The PaperCut MF client does use Log4j 1.x (prior to 21.2.8). **Please note** that log4j 1.x libraries have now been completely removed with the 21.2.8 maintenance release of PaperCut MF/NG. After upgrading, you will need to manually remove the legacy Mac client since it is not automatically removed, e.g: C:\Program Files\PaperCut MF\client\mac\legacy\PCClient.app.

There are some vulnerabilities that affect Log4j 1.x, explanations on how PaperCut MF is affected by these are in the table below.

| **CVE** | **Response** |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2022-23307 | This is related to a component called chainsaw. Chainsaw is program for viewing logs in a graphical user interface. PaperCut MF does not use chainsaw. |
| CVE-2022-23302 | This issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the default. PaperCut MF does not configure Log4j to use JMSSink and is not affected by this issue. |
| CVE-2022-23305 | This issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default. PaperCut MF does not configure Log4j to use JDBCAppender and is not affected by this issue. |

To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or both of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

RCE Security Advisory
<https://www.rcesecurity.com>

1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        Intel Data Center Manager
Vendor URL:     <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/data-center-manager-console/overview.html>
Type:           Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs [CWE-648]
Date found:     2022-07-16
Date published: 2022-12-07
CVSSv3 Score:   7.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
CVE:            -

2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
Intel Data Center Manager 5.1 (latest) and below

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
Energy costs are the fastest rising expense for today’s data centers. Intel® Data
Center Manager (Intel® DCM) provides real-time power and thermal consumption data,
giving you the clarity you need to lower power usage, increase rack density, and
prolong operation during outages.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The latest version (5.1) and all prior versions of Intel's DCM are vulnerable to a
local privileges escalation vulnerability using the application user "dcm" used to
run the web application and the rest interface. An attacker who gained RCE using
this dcm user (i.e., through Log4j) is then able to escalate their privileges to
root by abusing a weak Sudo configuration for the "dcm" user:

dcm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/SDPTool
dcm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/cp
dcm ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/chmod

The Intel Server Debug and Provisioning Tool (SDP Tool) must be installed for the
Data Center Manager to be vulnerable. Successful exploits can allow an authenticated
attacker to execute commands as root. In this way, the attacker can compromise the
victim system's entire confidentiality, integrity, and availability, thereby allowing
to persist within the attached network.

6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
Just one way of exploitation is by replacing the current sudoers configuration:

1.Create a new sudoers configuration file using the compromised "dcm" user in i.e. /tmp/
2.sudo chmod 440 /tmp/sudoers
3.sudo cp sudoers /etc/sudoers
4.sudo /bin/bash

7. SOLUTION
===========
None. Intel thinks that this is not a vulnerability and therefore does also not assign
a CVE for it.

8. REPORT TIMELINE
==================
2022-07-16: Discovery of the vulnerability
2022-07-16: Reported to vendor via their bug bounty program
2022-07-18: Vendor response: Sent to "appropriate reviewers"
2022-07-26: Vendor states that the vulnerability "depends on something that does not exist (eg; RCE)."
2022-07-26: Sent a clarification that a compromise of the "dcm" account is indeed necessary, but there have been RCEs
in the past (i.e. through Log4j)
2022-09-22: Vendor has troubles to reproduce the bug and asks for another PoC
2022-09-22: Sent a clarification about the PoC
2022-09-22: Vendor states that the report "does not clearly demonstrate a vulnerability in DCM" and the report will be
closed.
2022-09-23: Provided the vendor with a PoC utilizing Log4shell (CVE-2021-44228) in a former version of DCM
2022-10-10: Vendor asks whether the Log4shell bug is still reproducible in the latest version of DCM
2022-10-10: Made clear that Log4shell is not the point about the report
2022-10-11: Vendor states "We do not clearly see a a vulnerability demonstrated in DCM"
2022-10-12: [Back and forth about the provided PoCs]
2022-10-12: I'm giving up.
2022-12-07: Public disclosure

SSA-714170: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities (Log4Shell, CVE-2021-44228,
CVE-2021-45046) - Impact to SPPA-T3000

2021-12-16
Publication Date:
2022-02-08
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.1
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging library used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.

Siemens Energy is preparing updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for SPPA-T3000.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Ensure that SPPA-T3000 is set up according to the security concept deﬁned in the SPPA-T3000

security manual

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens Energy strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding
tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an
automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Energy strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision
by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens Energy strongly recommends to protect network access with
appropriate mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment
according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SPPA-T3000 SeS3000 Security Server provides the possibility to centrally deploy updates and security
patches for SPPA-T3000.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Apache Log4j V2, versions < 2.15.0 do not protect JNDI features (as used in conﬁguration, log
messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.

# CVE-2021-44228

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-44227.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-44269.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-44228 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)

#### Description

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

Subject: Re: CVE-2021-4104: Deserialization of untrusted data
 in JMSAppender in Apache Log4j 1.2

Hello,

>
> JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228.
>
> Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default.

Pretty sure someone was pushing for this, sorry to be nagging again, but
I don't think adding that to the overall panic and confusion is really
helping.

To emphasize again: this needs write access to the Log4j configuration.

This is in no way even coming close to CVE-2021-44228 - log4j 1.2 is
absolutely unaffected by that bug.

Only for people allowing untrusted parties to modify logger
configuration this could be considered to cross a trust boundary.
Allowing that, in my opinion, already would require very careful
consideration on the caller/user side and cannot be assumed to be safe.

If one can modify the logger configuration, one might as well
(re)configure a FileAppender and write to files with the process
privileges - most likely also resulting in code execution.

Everybody else should probably forget about this - expect for the fact
that they still might be using software that has been unsupported for
many years.

Configuring e.g. DataSources via JNDI name lookups is not that uncommon
in Java applications and application servers, these all suffer from the
same "vulnerability". JNDI is a overly complex mess of bad surprises
(and in my opinion absolutely should go away), but that is really not
log4j's fault.

Moritz

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-661247: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities (Log4Shell, CVE-2021-44228,
CVE-2021-45046) - Impact to Siemens Products

2021-12-13
Publication Date:
2022-08-09
Last Update:
Current Version:
V3.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.

Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating
this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details
regarding the investigation status.

Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented
in SSA-501673: https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf (CVE-2021-45105) and
SSA-784507: https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf (CVE-2021-44832).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

## Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#930724

Original Release Date: 2021-12-15 | Last Revised: 2024-04-17

---

### Overview

Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable Java application using Log4j.

CISA has published [Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) and provides a [Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list).

### Description

The default configuration of Apache Log4j supports [JNDI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html) (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups that can be exploited to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code via remote services such as LDAP, RMI, and DNS.

This vulnerability note includes information about the following related vulnerabilities.

* CVE-2021-44228 tracks the initial JNDI injection and RCE vulnerability in Log4j 2. This vulnerability poses considerabily more risk than the others.
* CVE-2021-4104 tracks a very similar vulnerability that affects Log4j 1 if JMSAppender and malicious connections have been configured.
* CVE-2021-45046 tracks an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228 affecting Log4j 2.15.0 when an attacker has "...control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern."

We provide [tools](https://github.com/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner) to scan for vulnerable jar files.

More information is available from the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page, including these highlights.

Certain conditions must be met to make Log4j 1.x vulnerable:

> Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Log4j API code alone is not affected:

> Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to log specially crafted messages can cause Log4j to connect to a service controlled by the attacker to download and execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

In Log4j [2.12.2](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fvl15g8lkqf9d8owqhg9z9p2hthvchws) (for Java 7) and [2.16.0](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t72msv9cpxw9q5zw8rfkhx52v24z57f1) (for Java 8 or later) the message lookups feature has been completely removed. In addition, JNDI is disabled by default and other default configuration settings are modified to mitigate CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

For Log4j 1, remove the JMSAppender class or do not configure it. Log4j 1 is [not supported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) and likely contains unfixed bugs and vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2019-17571).

For applications, services, and systems that use Log4j, consult the appropriate vendor or provider. See the CISA [Log4j Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list) and the [Vendor Information](#vendor-information) section below.

### Workarounds

Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath, for example:

`zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

As analysis has progressed, certain mitigations have been found to be less effective or incomplete. See "Older (discredited) mitigation measures" on the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page.

[SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html) also recommends write-protecting Log4j configuration files.

### [Apache Solr](#Apache%20Solr) Affected

Notified:  2021-12-17
Updated: 2021-12-22

**Statement Date:   December 21, 2021**

| **CVE-2021-4104** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

**Apache Solr** releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE (see **CVE-2021-44228**). Malicious input from a user-supplied query string (or any other URL request parameter like request handler name) is logged by default with log4j.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender (see **CVE-2021-4104**).

In response to the vulnerabilities, the Apache Solr team released version **Solr 8.11.1** that bundles **log4j 2.16.0**. An update to 2.17.0 (or later) will be done with the next maintenance release as Solr is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105 (see below).

Apache Solr releases are not vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**, because the MDC patterns used by Solr are for the collection, shard, replica, core and node names, and a potential trace id, which are all sanitized and injected into log files with "%X". Passing system property **log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true** is suitable to mitigate.

**Solr's Prometheus Exporter** uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

| **Vendor Statement:** | |
| weâre theoretically vulnerable to it, but an attacker would have to have write access to the file system to change the log4j configuration to enable the JMSAppender and to tweak the topic as described. Given that, I donât think itâs particularly relevant. I imagine this CVE would be more dangerous to someone that hosts someone elseâs Java code where they allow them to customize the log4j configuration running with their app. We are looking at moving to logback. | |

We are also aware of the reported Apache âLog4j 1.xâ vulnerability (CVE-2021-4104). We encourage customers to update to the latest version of Log4j 2. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the vulnerability for Google Cloud products and services. This is an ongoing event and we will continue to provide updates through this page (https://cloud.google.com/log4j2-security-advisory) and our customer communications channels.

Based on our findings, Google Workspace core services for consumer and paid users are not using Log4j 2 and are not impacted by the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. See below for a detailed status of the Workspace core services and other related products.

We recommend Google customers review all third-party apps and solutions accessing their data and validate the security status of those apps with their respective vendors. More details on managing apps authorized to access Google Workspace data are here and customers can review their list of solutions from the Google Cloud Marketplace by logging into their account. We also recommend validating the security status of any apps developed and deployed by customers within their environments.

The FreeBSD Project does not ship Java or Apache log4j as part of the base operating system. While there are third-party packages available via the ports and pkg system that may be affected, the FreeBSD Project defers to each upstream project on their vulnerability status. Please see the referenced tracking bug that lists known affected ports and pkgs.

| **CVE-2021-44228** | Not Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

FreeRADIUS is not affected by this vulnerability.

However, the RADIUS protocol allows for unknown users to attempt authentication. The user is in complete control over the RADIUS User-Name. The RADIUS server can produce logs containing the User-Name filed controlled by the attacker. Depending on the local site configuration, the logs may be consumed by something which eventually reaches a vulnerable log4j instance.

There is a good summary written by Radiator software https://blog.radiatorsoftware.com/2021/12/radius-servers-and-log4j-vulnerability.html

We agree with their analysis, and with their conclusions.

### Description

Apache Log4j Java library is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, known as Log4Shell, and related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, and CVE-2021-44832. Log4Shell allows remote unauthenticated attackers with the ability to inject text into log messages to execute arbitrary code loaded from malicious servers with the privileges of the process utilizing Log4j.

These products and services are not affected by Log4Shell: Bridgecrew, Cortex Data Lake, Cortex XDR agents, Cortex XSOAR, Cortex Xpanse, Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Expedition, the GlobalProtect app, IoT Security, Okyo Garde, PAN-DB Private Cloud, PAN-OS software running on firewalls including VM and CN series, Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Prisma Cloud Compute, Prisma SD-WAN (CloudGenix), SaaS Security, Traps, User-ID Agent, WildFire Appliance (WF-500), and WildFire Cloud.

We have determined that some configurations of Panorama appliances with PAN-OS 9.0, PAN-OS 9.1, and PAN-OS 10.0 are impacted by CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 through the use of Elasticsearch. Fixes were released on December 20, 2021 to address both vulnerabilities on impacted PAN-OS versions. Panorama appliances are not impacted by CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832.

NOTE: PAN-OS 8.1 and PAN-OS 10.1 versions for Panorama are not impacted by these issues. All versions of PAN-OS for firewalls and WildFire appliances are not affected.

These vulnerabilities impact Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application versions 1.0 - 2.0 provided by Enterprise Data Loss Prevention (DLP). Enterprise DLP is not affected by these issues.

The Palo Alto Networks Product Security Assurance team has completed evaluation of all products and services for these vulnerabilities. All cloud services with known possible impact have been remediated.

At this time, our guidance and criteria for impacted Panorama appliances remain the same for all related vulnerabilities. The Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application should now be upgraded to EDM CLI version 2.1 or later versions.

### Required Configuration for Exposure

Vulnerabilities CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 are applicable to Panorama hardware appliances and virtual appliances that have Elasticsearch software running. Appliances that are run in Panorama mode or Log Collector mode, and have also been part of a Collector Group, are impacted. You can determine if the appliance is part of a Collector Group by visiting 'Panorama > Managed Collectors' from the web interface and verify that Elasticsearch is running on the appliance by checking the command ‘show system software status | match elasticsearch’ from the CLI.

Appliances running in Management Only mode or Legacy mode, including those used for Prisma Access, are not impacted.

### Severity: CRITICAL

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
9.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of evidence showing the exploitation of these vulnerabilities against Panorama hardware appliances, Panorama virtual appliances, or the Exact Data Matching CLI application.

More information about the vulnerability's exploitation in the wild can be found in the Unit 42 threat brief: <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/>

### Weakness Type

[CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94")

### Solution

These issues are fixed in PAN-OS 9.0.15, PAN-OS 9.1.12-h3, PAN-OS 10.0.8-h8, and all later PAN-OS versions for Panorama hardware and virtual appliances.

NOTE: Though PAN-OS 10.1 is not impacted by the these vulnerabilities, the responsible Log4j code was removed for additional assurance from PAN-OS 10.1 versions for Panorama appliances starting with PAN-OS 10.1.4.

If Panorama is running an impacted version of PAN-OS, and you would prefer to upgrade to PAN-OS 10.1, upgrade all appliances in affected Collector Groups to the latest PAN-OS 10.1 Preferred release (PAN-OS 10.1.3-h1 at time of publication) to remediate these issues.

NOTE: Prisma Access customers should refer to the Prisma Access and Panorama version compatibility document before upgrading Panorama: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/compatibility-matrix/prisma-access/prisma-access-and-panorama-version-compatibility.html>

NOTE: Downgrading to PAN-OS 10.0 or earlier PAN-OS versions is not currently supported once Panorama is upgraded to PAN-OS 10.1.

Workarounds are available that eliminate the exposure for these older versions of Panorama until they can be upgraded to a fixed version.

For Enterprise Data Loss Prevention customers, these issues are fixed in Exact Data Matching (EDM) CLI application version 2.1 and all later EDM CLI versions.

No updates for other Palo Alto Networks products are required at this time.

Cortex XSOAR customers that have opted to deploy Elasticsearch in their environment should refer to the Elasticsearch announcement (ESA-2021-31) for remediation information. Elasticsearch 7.16 is not supported with Cortex XSOAR:

<https://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476>

Enable signatures for unique threat IDs 91991, 91994, 91995, 92001, and 92007 to block a number of known attacks against CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 across the network.

These signatures block the first stage of the attack. Suitable egress filtering is key to blocking the second stage of the attack. Use App-ID for ‘ldap’ and ‘rmi-iiop’ to block all LDAP and RMI to or from untrusted networks and unexpected sources.

SSL decryption needs to be enabled on the firewall to block known attacks over HTTPS.

Customers with log4j in their environments should upgrade or apply workarounds suggested by respective vendors, and not rely only on the Threat Prevention signatures.

See <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/> for more details on the Palo Alto Networks product capabilities to protect against attacks that exploit this issue.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

For each Panorama hardware appliance and virtual appliance running in Panorama mode or Log Collector mode, that has also been part of a Collector Group, must be removed from their Collector Group in ‘Panorama > Collector Group > Custom-CG-Name > General' from the web interface. Once affected appliances are removed from all groups, a Panorama commit and Collector Group push for all affected Collector Groups must be performed. The Collector Groups should not be deleted before performing the Collector Group push for the affected Collector Groups, else the Collector Group push will fail to remove the appliances.

NOTE: When this workaround is applied, logging and reporting features in Panorama will not work. All logs stored on the appliance will be lost once it is removed from the Collector Group.

Finally, all appliances that were part of the Collector Group need to be restarted to stop the use of Elasticsearch. This eliminates the exposure to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

You can restart the appliance by visiting ‘Panorama > Operations > Device Operations > Reboot Panorama’ from the web interface or by using the command ‘request restart system’ from the CLI.

Once these steps are completed, you can verify that Elasticsearch has stopped and the appliance’s exposure to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 has been removed, by running the command ‘show system software status | match elasticsearch’ from the CLI.

Managed PAN-OS firewalls can be configured to forward logs to other servers until Panorama log collection functionality is restored. Alternate Log Forwarding options are detailed here: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/objects/objects-log-forwarding.html>

Follow the security best practices listed in ‘Protecting Panorama and Log Collector Inbound and Outbound Communications’ to reduce the risk of successful exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 on Panorama appliances: <https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/general-articles/protecting-panorama-and-log-collector-inbound-and-outbound/ta-p/454071>

Additionally, use ACLs to limit network access to Panorama to only trusted users and trusted networks and IP addresses. Use App-ID for ‘ldap’ and ‘rmi-iiop’ to block all LDAP and RMI traffic to and from untrusted networks or unexpected sources.

No other workarounds or mitigations are available for Palo Alto Networks products at this time.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q. Does Panorama use Log4j?

> Panorama includes Elasticsearch, which uses the Log4j library.
>
> Panorama devices and virtual appliances running on PAN-OS 9.0, PAN-OS 9.1, and PAN-OS 10.0 software include Elasticsearch 5.6.7 which uses Log4j 2.9.1. Only the Panorama versions listed as affected in this advisory are susceptible to RCE risks associated with Log4Shell vulnerabilities. Though the fixed versions of Panorama list the same versions of Log4J, the vulnerable Java class file has been removed from them.
>
> Panorama with PAN-OS 8.1 includes Elasticsearch 2.2.2 with Log4j 1.2.17 and Panorama with PAN-OS 10.1 includes Elasticsearch 6.8.12 with Log4j 2.11.1. These do not have the security risks associated with Log4Shell.

#### Q. How was Log4j fixed in Panorama?

> In fixed versions of PAN-OS for Panorama, the included Elasticsearch package was remediated through the deletion of the vulnerable Log4j JndiLookup class file. This solution is provided by Elasticsearch announcement (ESA-2021-31) and the Log4j Security Vulnerabilities Page as a complete remediation option for CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Panorama appliances are not impacted by CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832, requiring no specific fix.
>
> NOTE: Though PAN-OS 10.1 is not impacted by these vulnerabilities, the JndiLookup.class was removed out of an abundance of caution in PAN-OS for Panorama appliances starting with PAN-OS 10.1.4.

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging library used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.

Siemens Energy is preparing updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for TraceAlertServer-
PLUS.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Review the status of the defense in depth recommendations that apply to your speciﬁc deployment
and align as needed. Especially the measures on the network layer to prevent accessibility from
other network segments

• Restrict physical access to the local networks of the solution

• Ensure that TraceAlertServerPLUS does not run with elevated privileges

• Check ﬁle system permissions

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is

SSA-397453

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

TraceAlertServerPLUS is a software component installed in SVC PLUS energy transmission solutions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20211210-0007
**Version:**
42.0

**Last updated:**
06/21/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-44228

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Log4j. Apache Log4j versions prior to 2.15.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could allow an attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

SnapCenter evaluation included its bundled plugins:

SnapCenter for Oracle, SnapCenter for HANA, SnapCenter for SCC, SnapCenter for Windows, SnapCenter for SQL and SnapCenter for Exchange

NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software) is affected only when the âVirtual Volumes (vVols)â feature is enabled on the cluster.

Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere version 9.7.1 is no longer under Full Support but is Affected. The available options are to either upgrade to a Full Support and fixed version of the software or follow the ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere Workaround. Versions of Virtual Storage Console for VMware prior to 9.7.1 include Apache Log4j version 1.x and are therefore Not Affected.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)\*\*Click/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: |

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2842-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache-log4j2
Version        : 2.7-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-44228
Debian Bug     : 1001478

Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team discovered that JNDI features
used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect
against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An
attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can
execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup
substitution is enabled.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
2.7-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.

For the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Subject: CVE-2021-4104: Deserialization of untrusted data in JMSAppender in
 Apache Log4j 1.2

Description:

JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2 is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration. The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228.

Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default.

Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

# BE-2022-0001: Use of Log4j in RenderFarm component for SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro

**Bentley ID:** BE-2022-0001

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44228

**Severity:** 10

**CVSS v3.1:** 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Publication date:** 2022-02-17

**Revision date:** 2022-02-17

**Summary**The RenderFarm component of SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro includes a Log4j version susceptible to the Log4Shell vulnerability.

**Details**If you are using the RenderFarm component of SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro and run distributed rendering over the network, you might be at risk of the Log4Shell vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44228 if a malicious attacker can access your render farm and send malicious payloads to it.

**Affected Versions**

| **Applications** | **Affected Versions** | **Mitigated Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYNCHRO 4D Pro | Versions prior to 6.4.3.2 | 6.4.3.2 and more recent |
| SYNCHRO Pro | Versions from 6.1 to 6.2.3 and 6.3 | 6.2.4.2 |

**Recommended Mitigations**Only very few of our users are using the RenderFarm component. If you aren’t using it, you aren’t at risk. You can follow the instructions here to safely remove the Log4j jar file if desired, without affecting SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro functionalities: https://communities.bentley.com/products/construction/w/construction\_\_wiki/57908/ . Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of SYNCHRO 4D Pro since the new version does not include this component anymore and SYNCHRO 4D Pro is the replacement product of SYNCHRO Pro.

Subject: CVE-2021-45046: Apache Log4j2 Thread Context Message Pattern and
 Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to a denial of service attack

Severity: moderate (CVSS: 3.7 AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

Description:

It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.

Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.

This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cve-2021-44228verbose.html).

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Security Alert. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

# Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

[![Wadeck Follonier](/images/avatars/wadeck.jpg)Wadeck Follonier](/blog/authors/wadeck/)[Daniel Beck](/blog/authors/daniel-beck/)[![HervÃ© Le Meur](/images/avatars/hlemeur.png)HervÃ© Le Meur](/blog/authors/hlemeur/)[![Mark Waite](/images/avatars/markewaite.jpg)Mark Waite](/blog/authors/markewaite/)
December 10, 2021
[Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Apache+Log4j+2+vulnerability+CVE-2021-44228&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jenkins.io%2Fblog%2F2021%2F12%2F10%2Flog4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228%2F)

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in the popular "Apache Log4j 2" library.
This vulnerability is identified as [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).

## Log4j in Jenkins

The Jenkins security team has confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core.
Jenkins plugins may be using Log4j.
You can identify whether Log4j is included with any plugin by running the following Groovy script in the [Script Console](/doc/book/managing/script-console/):

```
org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource
```

If this results in the following error, Log4j is **not** included in any installed and enabled plugin:

```
groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: org for class: Script1
```

Otherwise, the script output will print one location where Log4j is found, which includes the plugin name in the path.
That plugin should be disabled or uninstalled, followed by a Jenkins restart and another script execution until the "No such property" error appears.

Affected plugins and their mitigation status are listed in the Jenkins issue tracker.
See [this Jira Epic](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67353) for components known to be affected.

## Log4j in web application containers

If you are hosting your Jenkins in a separate web application container like Tomcat, Websphere, or Glassfish, check with the providers of those containers to assess if they are using a vulnerable version of Log4j.

When Jenkins runs from the Docker image, a native installer package (deb, rpm, msi), or is invoked with `java -jar jenkins.war`, it is not running inside a separate web application container.
It is using the built-in Jetty web application container that is bundled inside Jenkins and does not include Log4j.

## Log4j in Jenkins project infrastructure

The Jenkins infrastructure team is currently checking all Jenkins project infrastructure for the presence of vulnerable versions of the Log4j library.
This work is ongoing.
We may decide to disable some services temporarily out of an abundance of caution.
You can see the status of services on [the status page](https://status.jenkins.io/).

Subject: Re: CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not
 protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints

Hello,

> In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property "log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups" to “true” or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html>) protects against remote code execution by defaulting "com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase" and "com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase" to "false".

Please note, that Java 8u121+ does not necessarily protect against
remote code execution. There are known exploitation vectors using local
naming factories, e.g. a XBean BeanFactory (bundled with Tomcat). Also,
both RMI and LDAP lookups can be made to perform Java deserialization on
remote input and therefore there is a good chance for secondary RCE
exploits.

Moritz

[not affiliated with log4j, but maybe I can still shed some light]

The issue is that expansion of the lookup expressions was only disabled
for the message contents, not within the layout pattern formatting.

The thread local MDC context may contain information that can be
controlled by an attacker (if used). If you then have a layout pattern
configured that includes such information, e.g. $${ctx:name} [the
mentioned vectors via %X, %mdc, or %MDC I personally (and I think
others) could not easily replicate, maybe there is some trick to it],
expansion of an attacker provided expression will still happen and can
be exploited.

For versions <2.15 this renders log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
ineffective if such a layout configuration is used.

For =2.15 this is mostly mitigated by the fact protocol and target host
to which lookups are possible are also restricted to localhost by
default. There still seems to be a way to hang/crash the process, thou.

You could probably check whether any of the layouts used contain any MDC
data, but imho, if you want to avoid surprises you would really be
better off patching. Not sure why you would not be able to update.

Moritz

Package        : apache-log4j2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2020-9488
Debian Bug     : 959450 1001478

Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team discovered a critical security
vulnerability in Apache Log4j, a popular Logging Framework for Java. JNDI
features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect
against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker
who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary
code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From
version 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.

This update also fixes CVE-2020-9488 in the oldstable distribution
(buster). Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j
SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a
man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent through that
appender.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.15.0-1~deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.15.0-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.

For the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2>

# CISA Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) Vulnerability Guidance

This repository provides
[CISA's guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance)
and an overview of related software regarding the Log4j vulnerability
(CVE-2021-44228). CISA urges users and administrators to upgrade to Log4j 2.17.1
(Java 8), 2.12.4 (Java 7) and 2.3.2 (Java 6), and review and monitor the
[Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities webpage](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)
for updates and mitigation guidance.

The information in this repository is provided "as is" for informational
purposes only and is being assembled and updated by CISA through
collaboration with the broader cybersecurity community. Inquire with the
manufacturer or their respective online resources for the most up-to-date
information regarding any specific product listed. CISA does not endorse

## CISA Mitigation Guidance

When updates are available, agencies must update software
using Log4j to the newest version, which is the most
effective and manageable long-term option. Where
updating is not possible, the following mitigating
measures can be considered as a temporary solution
and apply to the entire solution stack.

* **Disable Log4j library.** Disabling software using the
  Log4j library is an effective measure, favoring
  controlled downtime over adversary-caused issues.
  This option could cause operational impacts and limit
  visibility into other issues.
* **Disable JNDI lookups or disable remote codebases.**
  This option, while effective, may involve
  developer work and could impact functionality.
* **Disconnect affected stacks.** Solution stacks not
  connected to agency networks pose a dramatically
  lower risk from attack. Consider temporarily
  disconnecting the stack from agency networks.
* **Isolate the system.** Create a “vulnerable network”
  VLAN and segment the solution stack from the
  rest of the enterprise network.
* **Deploy a properly configured Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) in front of the solution stack.**
  Deploying a WAF is an important, but incomplete,
  solution. While threat actors will be able to
  bypass this mitigation, the reduction in alerting
  will allow an agency SOC to focus on a smaller
  set of alerts.
* **Apply micropatch.** There are several micropatches
  available. They are not a part of the official
  update but may limit agency risk.
* Report incidents promptly to CISA and/or the FBI
  [here](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/report).

# CVE-2021-44228\_scanner

Applications that are vulnerable to the log4j [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) issue may be detectable by scanning jar, war, and ear files to search for the presence of `JndiLookup.class`.

Depending on the platform that you are investigating, the PowerShell or the Python3 script may make more sense to run. In both cases, the optional argument is the top-level directory that you would like to use to begin your search.

Any file discovered is worth investigation to determine if the application using it is vulnerable. For any `JndiLookup.class` that is present, log4j commonly includes the version in the jar file name. For example, a hit on `log4j-core-2.14.1.jar` would be indicative of a vulnerable application. Alternatively, `log4j-core-2.16.jar` may also produce a hit because the JndiLookup code is still present in the 2.16 version of log4j, but it is disabled by default. See [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) for more details.

## Screenshots

For example, here is an invocation of the PowerShell version of the scanner:
[![checkjndi.ps1 execution on c:\](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/raw/main/checkjndi_ps1.png "checkjndi.ps1 execution on c:\")](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/blob/main/checkjndi_ps1.png)

Similarly, here is an invocation of the Python3 version:
[![checkjndi.py execution on c:\](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/raw/main/checkjndi_py.png "checkjndi.py execution on c:\")](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/blob/main/checkjndi_py.png)

Finally, here is an invocation of the Bash version:
[![checkjndi.sh execution on ~/in](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/raw/main/checkjndi_sh.png "checkjndi.sh execution on ~/in")](/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner/blob/main/checkjndi_sh.png)

## Interpreting results

Note that the Bash and Python versions of this script will by design limit scans to a single filesystem.
With the PowerShell version, locations to scan can be piped into the script to have control of what is checked. For example, to scan a list of paths conatined in a the file `paths.txt`:

```
get-content .\paths.txt | .\checkjndi.ps1

```

Let's look at the first hit on our Windows scan execution:

```
WARNING: C:\tmp\2.15\log4j-core-2.15.0.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

```

Based on the jar name, this is a library from log4j 2.15. While this version of log4j fixes CVE-2021-44228, it still contained a flaw that is outlined as CVE-2021-45046. The impact of [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046) is a denial of service for only certain Java applications that use log4j 2.15. For Java applications that use log4j versions prior to 2.15 and that also fit the prerequisites for CVE-2021-45046 applying, the impact is RCE.

Let's look at the second hit:

```
C:\tmp\2.16\log4j-core-2.16.0.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class ** BUT APPEARS TO BE PATCHED **

```

This jar file contains a 2.16 version of log4j, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228. This result is reported for information purposes, which shows that a vendor has patched their product.

Let's look at the third hit:

```
WARNING: C:\tmp\ghidra_10.0_PUBLIC\Ghidra\Framework\Generic\lib\log4j-core-2.12.1.jar contains org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

```

Here we can see that Ghidra uses log4j version 2.12.1, and as such we should assume it to be vulnerable. And indeed, Ghidra versions before 10.1 are [vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases/tag/Ghidra_10.1_build).

You should investigate any hits reported by either of these scripts, and confirm that either the log4j version is indeed the fixed 2.16 version, or reach out to your software vendor to obtain a fixed version of the software. Alternatively, [VU#930724](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724) has information about how `JndiLookup.class` can be removed from vulnerable jar files.

## Errors returned

The PowerShell version of the scanner has additional error reporting when files or directories cannot be investigated. In particular, any `Unable to scan` errors reporting `UnauthorizedAccessException` is indicative of a permission problem in accessing a directory and/or a file. Any `Unable to scan` errors reporting `InvalidDataException` is usually due to a corrupt archive.

The Logging Services Security Team takes security seriously.
This allows our users to place their trust in Log4j for protecting their mission-critical data.
In this page we will help you find guidance on security-related issues and access to known vulnerabilities.

| Warning | [Log4j 1](/log4j/1.x) has [reached End of Life](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces) in 2015, and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against Log4j 1 are not checked and will not be fixed. Users should [upgrade to Log4j 2](/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html) to obtain security fixes. |
| --- | --- |

## Getting support

If you need help on building or configuring Logging Services projects or other help on following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed here, please use our [user support channels](support.html#discussions).

| Tip | If you need to apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the project version that you are using. These instructions can be found in `BUILDING.adoc`, `BUILDING.md`, etc. files distributed with the sources. |
| --- | --- |

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behaviour that has a security impact, or if the descriptions here are incomplete, please report them **privately** to the Logging Services Security Team.

| Important | We urge you to **carefully read the threat model** detailed in following sections before submitting a report. It guides users on certain safety instructions while using Logging Services software and elaborates on what counts as an unexpected behaviour that has a security impact. |
| --- | --- |

### Common threat model

Below we share the threat model shared by all Logging Services projects.

#### Code signing

All Logging Services software release distributions are signed using GPG using a key from the Logging Services PMC [KEYS file](https://downloads.apache.org/logging/KEYS).
Information on how to verify releases signatures are explained further in [the Download page](download.html).
Thus, GPG signatures should be validated in your build process.

#### Configuration sources

All configuration sources to an application must be trusted by the programmer.
When loading a configuration file from disk (especially when a monitor interval is configured to reload the file periodically), the location of the configuration file must be kept safe from unauthorized modifications.
Similarly, when loading a configuration file over the network such as through HTTP, this should be configured to use TLS or a secure connection in general with strong authentication guarantees.
This remote location must be kept safe from unauthorized modifications.

For Java-based projects supporting JNDI or JMX,
when configurations are modified through JMX, the JMX server should be safely configured to require authentication and a secure connection if being accessed over the network.
When configurations are provided through JNDI, these should only use the `java` scheme for sharing configurations in a Java EE or Jakarta EE application service.
JNDI-sourced configurations should not use other JNDI providers such as LDAP, DNS, or RMI, as all these providers are difficult to properly secure.

#### Java Object Serialization Stream Protocol

[Java Object Serialization Stream Protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html) should not be used to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
See [the related OWASP guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data) for details.

### Log4j threat model

Below we share the threat model specific to [Log4j](/log4j).

#### Parameterized logging

When using a log message containing template parameters like `{}`, only the format string is evaluated for parameters to be substituted.
The message parameters themselves are not evaluated for parameters; they are only included in the format string corresponding to their template position.
The conversion of message parameters into a string is done on-demand depending on the layout being used.
When structure-preserving transformations of log message data are required, the `Message` API should be used for logging structured data combined with a structured layout (e.g., `JsonTemplateLayout`).
Format strings should be compile-time constants, and under no circumstances should format strings be built using user-controlled input data.

#### Unstructured logging

When using an unstructured layout such as `PatternLayout`, no guarantees can be made about the output format.
This layout is mainly useful for development purposes and should not be relied on in production applications.
For example, if a log message contains new lines, these are not escaped or encoded specially unless the configured pattern uses the `%encode{pattern}{CRLF}` wrapper pattern converter (which will encode a carriage return as the string `\r` and a line feed as the string `\n`) or some other `%encode` option.
Note that `%xEx` is appended to the pattern unless already present.
Similarly, other encoding options are available for other formats, but pattern layouts cannot make assumptions about the entire output.
As such, when using unstructured layouts, no user-controlled input should be included in logs.
It is strongly recommended that a structured layout (e.g., `JsonTemplateLayout`) is used instead for these situations.
Note that `StrLookup` plugins (those referenced by `${…​}` templates in configuration files) that contain user-provided input should not be referenced by layouts.

#### Structured logging

When using a structured layout (most layouts besides pattern layout), log messages are encoded according to various output formats.
These safely encode the various fields included in a log message.
For example, the `JsonTemplateLayout` can be configured to output log messages in various JSON structures where all log data is properly encoded into safely parseable JSON.
This is the recommended mode of operation for use with log parsing and log collection tools that rely on log files or arbitrary output streams.

#### Java Security Manager

Log4j 3 no longer supports running in or using a custom `SecurityManager`.
This Java feature has been deprecated for removal in Java 21.
Log4j 2 includes partial support for running with a Security Manager.

#### Log masking

Log4j, like any other generic logging library, cannot generically support log masking of sensitive data.
While custom plugins may be developed to attempt to mask various regular expressions (such as a string that looks like a credit card number), the general problem of log masking is equivalent to the halting problem in computer science where sensitive data can always be obfuscated in such a way as to avoid detection by log masking.
As such, it is the responsibility of the developer to properly demarcate sensitive data such that it can be consistently masked by log masking plugins.
This sort of use case should make use of the `Message` API for better control over the output of such data.

#### Availability

Log4j goes to great lengths to minimize performance overhead along with options for minimizing latency or maximizing throughput.
However, we cannot guarantee availability of the application if the appenders cannot keep up with the logs being written.
Synchronous logging can cause applications to block and wait for a log message to be written.
Asynchronous logging can also cause applications to block and wait depending on the wait strategy and queue full policy configured.
Configuring too large or too many buffers in an application can also result in out of memory errors.

#### Compressing logs

If log compression is used along with custom encryption where logs contain user-controlled input, then this can lead to a [CRIME attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME) style vulnerability where a chosen-plaintext attack is combined with information leakage caused by how the compression algorithm handles different inputs.
The simplest way to avoid this problem is to never combine compression with encryption when encoding user-controlled input.

### Log4Net threat model

Below we share the threat model specific to [log4net](/log4net).

#### Parameterized logging

When using a log message containing template parameters like `{0}`, only the format string is evaluated for parameters to be substituted.
The message parameters themselves are not evaluated for parameters; they are only included in the format string corresponding to their template position.
The conversion of message parameters into a string is done on-demand depending on the layout being used.
When structure-preserving transformations of log data are required, a structured layout (e.g., `XmlLayout`) should be used.
Format strings should be compile-time constants, and under no circumstances should format strings be built using user-controlled input data.

#### Unstructured logging

When using an unstructured layout such as `PatternLayout`, no guarantees can be made about the output format.
This layout is mainly useful for development purposes and should not be relied on in production applications.
For example, if a log message contains new lines, these are not escaped or encoded.
As such, when using unstructured layouts, no user-controlled input should be included in logs.
It is strongly recommended that a structured layout (e.g., `XmlLayout`) is used instead for these situations.

#### Structured logging

When using a structured layout (most layouts besides pattern layout), log messages are encoded according to various output formats.
These safely encode the various fields included in a log message.
For example, the `XmlLayout` can be used to output log messages in an XML structure where all log data is properly encoded into safely parseable XML.
This is the recommended mode of operation for use with log parsing and log collection tools that rely on log files or arbitrary output streams.

#### Log masking

Log4Net, like any other generic logging library, cannot generically support log masking of sensitive data.
While custom plugins may be developed to attempt to mask various regular expressions (such as a string that looks like a credit card number), the general problem of log masking is equivalent to the halting problem in computer science where sensitive data can always be obfuscated in such a way as to avoid detection by log masking.
As such, it is the responsibility of the developer to properly demarcate sensitive data such that it can be consistently masked by log masking plugins.

#### Availability

Log4Net goes to great lengths to minimize performance overhead along with options for minimizing latency or maximizing throughput.
However, we cannot guarantee availability of the application if the appenders cannot keep up with the logs being written.
Logging can cause applications to block and wait for a log message to be written.

## Vulnerability handling policy

The Logging Services Security Team follows the [ASF Project Security](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html) guide for handling security vulnerabilities.

Reported security vulnerabilities are subject to voting (by means of [*lazy approval*](https://logging.apache.org/guidelines.html), preferably) in the private security mailing list before creating a CVE and populating its associated content.
This procedure involves only the creation of CVEs and blocks neither (vulnerability) fixes, nor releases.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)

Many Logging Services projects distribute [CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr) along with each deployed artifact.
This is streamlined by [Logging Parent](/logging-parent) for Maven-based projects.

Produced SBOMs contain BOM-links referring to a [CycloneDX Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr) that Apache Logging Services uses for all projects it maintains.
This VDR is accessible through the following URL: <https://logging.apache.org/cyclonedx/vdr.xml>

## Known vulnerabilities

The Logging Services Security Team believes that accuracy, completeness and availability of security information is essential for our users.
We choose to pool all information on this one page, allowing easy searching for security vulnerabilities over a range of criteria.

| Note | We adhere to [the Maven version range syntax](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html) while sharing versions of affected components. We only extend this mathematical notation with set union operator (i.e., `âª`) to denote union of multiple ranges. |

### [CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832)

| Summary | JDBC appender is vulnerable to remote code execution in certain configurations |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 6.6 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta7, 2.3.2) âª [2.4, 2.12.4) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.1)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.2` (for Java 6), `2.12.4` (for Java 7), or `2.17.1` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

An attacker with write access to the logging configuration can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code.
This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the `java` protocol.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.3.2` (for Java 6), `2.12.4` (for Java 7), or `2.17.1` (for Java 8 and later).

In prior releases confirm that if the JDBC Appender is being used it is not configured to use any protocol other than `java`.

### [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105)

| Summary | Infinite recursion in lookup evaluation |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 5.9 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-alpha1, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

Log4j versions `2.0-alpha1` through `2.16.0` (excluding `2.3.1` and `2.12.3`), did not protect from uncontrolled recursion that can be implemented using self-referential lookups.
When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a `StackOverflowError` that will terminate the process.
This is also known as a *DoS (Denial-of-Service)* attack.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

Alternatively, this infinite recursion issue can be mitigated in configuration:

* In PatternLayout in the logging configuration, replace Context Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` with Thread Context Map patterns (`%X`, `%mdc`, or `%MDC`).
* Otherwise, in the configuration, remove references to Context Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` where they originate
  from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input.
  Note that this mitigation is insufficient in releases older than `2.12.2` (for Java 7), and `2.16.0` (for Java 8 and later) as the issues fixed in those releases will still be present.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)

| Summary | Thread Context Lookup is vulnerable to remote code execution in certain configurations |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 9.0 CRITICAL (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta9, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

It was found that the fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](#CVE-2021-44228) in Log4j `2.15.0` was incomplete in certain non-default configurations.
When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Thread Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) can craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments.
Remote code execution has been demonstrated on macOS, Fedora, Arch Linux, and Alpine Linux.

Note that this vulnerability is not limited to just the JNDI lookup.
Any other Lookup could also be included in a Thread Context Map variable and possibly have private details exposed to anyone with access to the logs.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to Log4j `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

#### Credits

This issue was discovered by Kai Mindermann of iC Consult and separately by 4ra1n.

Additional vulnerability details discovered independently by Ash Fox of Google, Alvaro MuÃ±oz and Tony Torralba from GitHub, Anthony Weems of Praetorian, and RyotaK (@ryotkak).

### [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)

| Summary | JNDI lookup can be exploited to execute arbitrary code loaded from an LDAP server |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 10.0 CRITICAL (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta9, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

In Log4j, the JNDI features used in configurations, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.
An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

#### Mitigation

##### Log4j 1 mitigation

| Warning | [Log4j 1](/log4j/1.x) has [reached End of Life](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces) in 2015, and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against Log4j 1 are not checked and will not be fixed. Users should [upgrade to Log4j 2](/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html) to obtain security fixes. |
| --- | --- |

Log4j 1 does not have Lookups, so the risk is lower.
Applications using Log4j 1 are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration.
A separate CVE ([CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104)) has been filed for this vulnerability.
To mitigate, audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no `JMSAppender` configured.
Log4j 1 configurations without `JMSAppender` are not impacted by this vulnerability.

##### Log4j 2 mitigation

Upgrade to Log4j `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

### [CVE-2020-9488](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9488)

| Summary | Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in SMTP appender |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 3.7 LOW (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta1, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.1, 2.13.2)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.12.3` (Java 7) and `2.13.2` (Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in SMTP appender.
This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log
messages sent through that appender.

The reported issue was caused by an error in `SslConfiguration`.
Any element using `SslConfiguration` in the Log4j `Configuration` is also affected by this issue.
This includes `HttpAppender`, `SocketAppender`, and `SyslogAppender`.
Usages of `SslConfiguration` that are configured via system properties are not affected.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.12.3` (Java 7) or `2.13.2` (Java 8 and later).

Alternatively, users can set the `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` system property to `true` to enable SMTPS hostname verification for all SMTPS mail sessions.

### [CVE-2017-5645](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5645)

| Summary | TCP/UDP socket servers can be exploited to execute arbitrary code |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 2.0 Score & Vector | 7.5 HIGH (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-alpha1, 2.8.2)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.8.2` (Java 7) |

#### Description

When using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.

#### Mitigation

Java 7 and above users should migrate to version `2.8.2` or avoid using the socket server classes.
Java 6 users should avoid using the TCP or UDP socket server classes, or they can manually backport [the security fix commit](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/5dcc192) from `2.8.2`.

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2,
2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and
parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI
related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message
parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message
lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been
disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and
2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this
vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net,
log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-66d6c484f3
2021-12-22 01:12:27.897393
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : jansi
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.1.1
Release : 4.fc34
URL : <http://fusesource.github.io/jansi/>
Summary : Generate and interpret ANSI escape sequences in Java
Description :
Jansi is a small java library that allows you to use ANSI escape sequences
in your Java console applications. It implements ANSI support on platforms
which don't support it like Windows and provides graceful degradation for
when output is being sent to output devices which cannot support ANSI sequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update provides log4j 2.16.0, to address the critical vulnerability
CVE-2021-44228 ("Log4Shell"). Note with 2.16.0, JNDI is entirely disabled by
default; to use it, you must set `log4j2.enableJndi` (please carefully consider
potential security issues before doing so). The updated jansi adds (back) a
feature, `AnsiRenderer`, which the newer log4j requires; this is the only change
to jansi. For other changes in log4j 2.16.0, see the [upstream
changelog](<https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0>).
Most changes are compatible enhancements or bug fixes, but there may be some
behaviour changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Mon Dec 13 2021 Adam Williamson awilliam@redhat.com - 2.1.1-4
- Backport patch to bring back AnsiRenderer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
References:

[ 1 ] Bug #2030945 - CVE-2021-44228 log4j: log4j-core: Remote code execution in Log4j 2.x when logs contain an attacker-controlled string value [fedora-all]
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2030945>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Subject: Re: CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not
 protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints

Hi,

> Java 8u121 (see <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html>) protects against remote code execution by defaulting "com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase" and "com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase" to "false".
>

I also believe this should be Java 8u191, as only then remote
classloading for LDAP was disabled by default. Only since then the
direct remote classloading attack vector through JNDI injection is
mitigated.

I put together a little post on the different JNDI attack vectors and
how which Java versions are affected:
<<https://mbechler.github.io/2021/12/10/PSA_Log4Shell_JNDI_Injection/>>

TLDR:
- Direct remote classloading through RMI up to 8u121 (and corresponding
patch versions)
- Direct remote classloading through LDAP up to 8u191 (and corresponding
patch versions)
- Runtime environment may provide exploitable local JNDI factory classes
(Tomcat, WebSphere known)
- Deserialization attacks are possible (if no global filter is applied),
independent of runtime version

=> Do not rely on newer Java versions for mitigation, do patch
immediately (or remove/disable the functionality)

Moritz

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

### Affected Products and Patch Information

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed below. The product area is shown in the Patch Availability Document column.

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### [DVWA - Brute Force (High Level) - Anti-CSRF Tokens](https://www.nu11secur1ty.com/2015/11/dvwa-brute-force-high-level-anti-csrf.html)

[ноември 21, 2015](https://www.nu11secur1ty.com/2015/11/dvwa-brute-force-high-level-anti-csrf.html "permanent link")

This is the final "how to" guide which brute focuses Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), this time on the high security level. It is an expansion from the "low" level (which is a straightforward HTTP GET form attack). The main login screen shares similar issues (brute force-able and with anti-CSRF tokens). The only other posting is the "medium" security level post (which deals with timing issues). For the final time, let's pretend we do not know any credentials for DVWA.... Let's play dumb and brute force DVWA... once and for all! TL;DR: Quick copy/paste 1: CSRF=$(curl -s -c dvwa.cookie "192.168.1.44/DVWA/login.php" | awk -F 'value=' '/user\_token/ {print $2}' | cut -d "'" -f2) 2: SESSIONID=$(grep PHPSESSID dvwa.cookie | cut -d $'\t' -f7) 3: curl -s -b dvwa.cookie -d "username=admin&password=password&user\_token=${CSRF}&Login=Login" "192.168.1...

SSA-479842: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities - Impact to Siemens
Energy Sensformer / Sensgear (Platform, Basic and Advanced)

2021-12-21
Publication Date:
2021-12-23
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.1
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution. Furthermore, one additional denial of service
vulnerability, CVE-2021-45105, was disclosed.

The Siemens Energy Sensformer / Sensgear cloud service was affected by these vulnerabilities and has
remediated them. No user actions are necessary.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any additional speciﬁc workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the General
Security Recommendations.

Product speciﬁc mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Sensformer / Sensgear contains the necessary sensors for entering the most important operating
parameters – such as oil-level, temperature, LV winding current and GPS-positioning of a transformer.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Apache Log4j V2, versions < 2.15.0 do not protect JNDI features (as used in conﬁguration, log
messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45105

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from
self-referential lookups, when the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a
Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a denial of service condition.
