SSA-661247: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities (Log4Shell, CVE-2021-44228,
CVE-2021-45046) - Impact to Siemens Products

2021-12-13
Publication Date:
2022-08-09
Last Update:
Current Version:
V3.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.

Siemens is currently investigating to determine which products are affected and is continuously updating
this advisory as more information becomes available. See section Additional Information for more details
regarding the investigation status.

Note: two additional vulnerabilities were published for Apache Log4j, the impact of which are documented
in SSA-501673: https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-501673.pdf (CVE-2021-45105) and
SSA-784507: https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-784507.pdf (CVE-2021-44832).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

SSA-661247

© Siemens 2022

Page 17 of 27

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• If the speciﬁc Siemens product allows it: Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: ‘zip -q
-d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class’. This measure mitigates
both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Note: in case you reinstall or update the product to a
yet unﬁxed version later: check if the vulnerable JndiLookup class has to be removed again.

• If the speciﬁc Siemens product allows it: Update the Log4j component to 2.16.0 or later versions
on the systems where the product is installed. This measure mitigates both CVE-2021-44228 and
CVE-2021-45046. Note: in case you reinstall or update the product to a yet unﬁxed version later:
check if the Log4j component has to be updated again.

• If, for a particular product listed in the table above, no remediation or speciﬁc mitigation is given:

Block both incoming and outgoing connections between the system and the Internet.

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Apache Log4j V2, versions < 2.15.0 do not protect JNDI features (as used in conﬁguration, log
messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.
