To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or both of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
