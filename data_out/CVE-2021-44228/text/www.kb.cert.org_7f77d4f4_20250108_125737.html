## Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#930724

Original Release Date: 2021-12-15 | Last Revised: 2024-04-17

---

### Overview

Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable Java application using Log4j.

CISA has published [Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) and provides a [Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list).

### Description

The default configuration of Apache Log4j supports [JNDI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html) (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups that can be exploited to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code via remote services such as LDAP, RMI, and DNS.

This vulnerability note includes information about the following related vulnerabilities.

* CVE-2021-44228 tracks the initial JNDI injection and RCE vulnerability in Log4j 2. This vulnerability poses considerabily more risk than the others.
* CVE-2021-4104 tracks a very similar vulnerability that affects Log4j 1 if JMSAppender and malicious connections have been configured.
* CVE-2021-45046 tracks an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228 affecting Log4j 2.15.0 when an attacker has "...control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern."

We provide [tools](https://github.com/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner) to scan for vulnerable jar files.

More information is available from the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page, including these highlights.

Certain conditions must be met to make Log4j 1.x vulnerable:

> Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Log4j API code alone is not affected:

> Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to log specially crafted messages can cause Log4j to connect to a service controlled by the attacker to download and execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

In Log4j [2.12.2](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fvl15g8lkqf9d8owqhg9z9p2hthvchws) (for Java 7) and [2.16.0](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t72msv9cpxw9q5zw8rfkhx52v24z57f1) (for Java 8 or later) the message lookups feature has been completely removed. In addition, JNDI is disabled by default and other default configuration settings are modified to mitigate CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

For Log4j 1, remove the JMSAppender class or do not configure it. Log4j 1 is [not supported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) and likely contains unfixed bugs and vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2019-17571).

For applications, services, and systems that use Log4j, consult the appropriate vendor or provider. See the CISA [Log4j Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list) and the [Vendor Information](#vendor-information) section below.

### Workarounds

Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath, for example:

`zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

As analysis has progressed, certain mitigations have been found to be less effective or incomplete. See "Older (discredited) mitigation measures" on the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page.

[SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html) also recommends write-protecting Log4j configuration files.

### [Apache Solr](#Apache%20Solr) Affected

| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

**Apache Solr** releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE (see **CVE-2021-44228**). Malicious input from a user-supplied query string (or any other URL request parameter like request handler name) is logged by default with log4j.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender (see **CVE-2021-4104**).

In response to the vulnerabilities, the Apache Solr team released version **Solr 8.11.1** that bundles **log4j 2.16.0**. An update to 2.17.0 (or later) will be done with the next maintenance release as Solr is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105 (see below).

Apache Solr releases are not vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**, because the MDC patterns used by Solr are for the collection, shard, replica, core and node names, and a potential trace id, which are all sanitized and injected into log files with "%X". Passing system property **log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true** is suitable to mitigate.

**Solr's Prometheus Exporter** uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

| **CVE-2021-4104** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **Vendor Statement:** | |
| weâre theoretically vulnerable to it, but an attacker would have to have write access to the file system to change the log4j configuration to enable the JMSAppender and to tweak the topic as described. Given that, I donât think itâs particularly relevant. I imagine this CVE would be more dangerous to someone that hosts someone elseâs Java code where they allow them to customize the log4j configuration running with their app. We are looking at moving to logback. | |

#### Vendor Statement

Google Cloud is actively following the security vulnerabilities in the open-source Apache âLog4j 2" utility (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046). We are also aware of the reported Apache âLog4j 1.xâ vulnerability (CVE-2021-4104). We encourage customers to update to the latest version of Log4j 2. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the vulnerability for Google Cloud products and services. This is an ongoing event and we will continue to provide updates through this page (https://cloud.google.com/log4j2-security-advisory) and our customer communications channels.

Based on our findings, Google Workspace core services for consumer and paid users are not using Log4j 2 and are not impacted by the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. See below for a detailed status of the Workspace core services and other related products.

We recommend Google customers review all third-party apps and solutions accessing their data and validate the security status of those apps with their respective vendors. More details on managing apps authorized to access Google Workspace data are here and customers can review their list of solutions from the Google Cloud Marketplace by logging into their account. We also recommend validating the security status of any apps developed and deployed by customers within their environments.

#### Vendor Statement

FreeRADIUS is not affected by this vulnerability.

However, the RADIUS protocol allows for unknown users to attempt authentication. The user is in complete control over the RADIUS User-Name. The RADIUS server can produce logs containing the User-Name filed controlled by the attacker. Depending on the local site configuration, the logs may be consumed by something which eventually reaches a vulnerable log4j instance.

There is a good summary written by Radiator software https://blog.radiatorsoftware.com/2021/12/radius-servers-and-log4j-vulnerability.html

We agree with their analysis, and with their conclusions.
