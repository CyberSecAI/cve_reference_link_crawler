# BE-2022-0001: Use of Log4j in RenderFarm component for SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro

**Bentley ID:** BE-2022-0001

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44228

**Severity:** 10

**CVSS v3.1:** 3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Publication date:** 2022-02-17

**Revision date:** 2022-02-17

**Summary**The RenderFarm component of SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro includes a Log4j version susceptible to the Log4Shell vulnerability.

**Details**If you are using the RenderFarm component of SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro and run distributed rendering over the network, you might be at risk of the Log4Shell vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44228 if a malicious attacker can access your render farm and send malicious payloads to it.

**Affected Versions**

| **Applications** | **Affected Versions** | **Mitigated Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SYNCHRO 4D Pro | Versions prior to 6.4.3.2 | 6.4.3.2 and more recent |
| SYNCHRO Pro | Versions from 6.1 to 6.2.3 and 6.3 | 6.2.4.2 |

**Recommended Mitigations**Only very few of our users are using the RenderFarm component. If you aren’t using it, you aren’t at risk. You can follow the instructions here to safely remove the Log4j jar file if desired, without affecting SYNCHRO 4D Pro and SYNCHRO Pro functionalities: https://communities.bentley.com/products/construction/w/construction\_\_wiki/57908/ . Bentley recommends updating to the latest versions of SYNCHRO 4D Pro since the new version does not include this component anymore and SYNCHRO 4D Pro is the replacement product of SYNCHRO Pro.
