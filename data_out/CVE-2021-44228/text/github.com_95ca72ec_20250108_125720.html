# CISA Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) Vulnerability Guidance

This repository provides
[CISA's guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance)
and an overview of related software regarding the Log4j vulnerability
(CVE-2021-44228). CISA urges users and administrators to upgrade to Log4j 2.17.1
(Java 8), 2.12.4 (Java 7) and 2.3.2 (Java 6), and review and monitor the
[Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities webpage](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)
for updates and mitigation guidance.

The information in this repository is provided "as is" for informational
purposes only and is being assembled and updated by CISA through
collaboration with the broader cybersecurity community. Inquire with the
manufacturer or their respective online resources for the most up-to-date
information regarding any specific product listed. CISA does not endorse

## CISA Mitigation Guidance

When updates are available, agencies must update software
using Log4j to the newest version, which is the most
effective and manageable long-term option. Where
updating is not possible, the following mitigating
measures can be considered as a temporary solution
and apply to the entire solution stack.

* **Disable Log4j library.** Disabling software using the
  Log4j library is an effective measure, favoring
  controlled downtime over adversary-caused issues.
  This option could cause operational impacts and limit
  visibility into other issues.
* **Disable JNDI lookups or disable remote codebases.**
  This option, while effective, may involve
  developer work and could impact functionality.
* **Disconnect affected stacks.** Solution stacks not
  connected to agency networks pose a dramatically
  lower risk from attack. Consider temporarily
  disconnecting the stack from agency networks.
* **Isolate the system.** Create a “vulnerable network”
  VLAN and segment the solution stack from the
  rest of the enterprise network.
* **Deploy a properly configured Web Application
  Firewall (WAF) in front of the solution stack.**
  Deploying a WAF is an important, but incomplete,
  solution. While threat actors will be able to
  bypass this mitigation, the reduction in alerting
  will allow an agency SOC to focus on a smaller
  set of alerts.
* **Apply micropatch.** There are several micropatches
  available. They are not a part of the official
  update but may limit agency risk.
* Report incidents promptly to CISA and/or the FBI
  [here](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/report).
