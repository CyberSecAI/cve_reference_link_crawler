Subject: Re: CVE-2021-44228: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not
 protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints

Hello,

> In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property "log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups" to “true” or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html>) protects against remote code execution by defaulting "com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase" and "com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase" to "false".

Please note, that Java 8u121+ does not necessarily protect against
remote code execution. There are known exploitation vectors using local
naming factories, e.g. a XBean BeanFactory (bundled with Tomcat). Also,
both RMI and LDAP lookups can be made to perform Java deserialization on
remote input and therefore there is a good chance for secondary RCE
exploits.

Moritz
