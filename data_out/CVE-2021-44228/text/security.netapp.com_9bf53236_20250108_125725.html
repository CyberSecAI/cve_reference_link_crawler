**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20211210-0007
**Version:**
42.0

**Last updated:**
06/21/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-44228

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Log4j. Apache Log4j versions prior to 2.15.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could allow an attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

SnapCenter evaluation included its bundled plugins:

SnapCenter for Oracle, SnapCenter for HANA, SnapCenter for SCC, SnapCenter for Windows, SnapCenter for SQL and SnapCenter for Exchange

NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software) is affected only when the âVirtual Volumes (vVols)â feature is enabled on the cluster.

Virtual Storage Console for VMware vSphere version 9.7.1 is no longer under Full Support but is Affected. The available options are to either upgrade to a Full Support and fixed version of the software or follow the ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere Workaround. Versions of Virtual Storage Console for VMware prior to 9.7.1 include Apache Log4j version 1.x and are therefore Not Affected.
