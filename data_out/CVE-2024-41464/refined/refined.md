- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `RouteStatic` function due to unchecked copying of the `mitInterface` parameter to a stack variable using `sprintf`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow, lack of input validation on the size of the `mitInterface` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by sending a crafted request with an overly long `mitInterface` parameter, which overwrites the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/addressNat` endpoint with a long `mitInterface` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device on the network, and control the `mitInterface` parameter's value.
