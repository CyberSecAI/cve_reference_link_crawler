- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VikBooking plugin allows direct access to certain menus and settings through specific URL parameters, bypassing intended authorization checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate user permissions when accessing administrative functions through the `option` and `task` parameters in the URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user with subscriber privileges or above can access and modify plugin settings they should not have access to, which can potentially lead to unauthorized changes to the plugin configuration, or viewing sensitive information, such as order details.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress admin panel, using parameters such as `option=com_vikbooking` and `task=config` or `task=orders`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber privileges. The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
