- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of the `cname`, `comname`, `state`, and `city` parameters within the `/edit-client-details.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parameters. When a victim interacts with the compromised data, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `/edit-client-details.php` page by injecting malicious scripts into the `cname`, `comname`, `state`, and `city` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access and edit client details in the Client Management System, specifically the `/manage-client.php` and `/edit-client-details.php` pages. They also need the ability to save these changes.
