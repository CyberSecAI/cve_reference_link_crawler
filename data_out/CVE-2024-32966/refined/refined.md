Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper HTML entity escaping in the directory listing functionality of the `static-web-server`. Specifically, the file names displayed in directory listings are not sanitized, allowing for the inclusion of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue. The application fails to neutralize or encode user-controlled input, specifically file names, before displaying them in HTML context, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.  Specifically, `file_name` and `current_path` are mentioned as potentially malicious, and  `file_uri` could also be malicious.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the web server's domain. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to:
    1.  Have the ability to upload files or create directories with chosen names to the server in a directory where directory listings are enabled.
    2. Use a malicious file name that includes Javascript, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt`
    3. Wait for a user to browse to the directory listing, at which point the malicious code will execute in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the privilege to upload files or create directories on the server, and the server must have directory listings enabled. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the web server itself to execute the code in other users' browsers.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory mentions that `hyper` was handling some scenarios related to `file_uri`
* The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
* The specific CWE related to this vulnerability is CWE-80, which pertains to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in output.
* The vulnerability affects versions `<= 2.28.0` of the `static-web-server` and is fixed in versions `>= 2.30.0`.
