# Arbitrary file write when scanning a specially-crafted local PyPI package

Moderate

[christophetd](/christophetd)
published
GHSA-rp2v-v467-q9vq
Nov 29, 2022

## Package

pip

guarddog
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<v0.1.5

## Patched versions

v0.1.5

## Description

### Impact

Running GuardDog against a specially-crafted package can allow an attacker to write an arbitrary file on the machine where GuardDog is executed.

This is due to a path traversal vulnerability when extracting the `.tar.gz` file of the package being scanned, which exists by design in the `tarfile.TarFile.extractall` function. See also <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.TarFile.extractall>

### Remediation

Upgrade to GuardDog v0.1.5 or more recent.

### References

* <https://semgrep.dev/r?q=trailofbits.python.tarfile-extractall-traversal.tarfile-extractall-traversal>
* <https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

## What's Changed

* Adding exit codes by [@Torxed](https://github.com/Torxed) in [#76](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/pull/76). GuardDog can now exit with a non-zero status code if `--exit-non-zero-on-finding` is provided
* Use tarsafe instead of built-in tarfile to extract archives by [@christophetd](https://github.com/christophetd) in [#89](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/pull/89). Fixes [security issue GHSA-rp2v-v467-q9vq](https://github.com/DataDog/guarddog/security/advisories/GHSA-rp2v-v467-q9vq)
