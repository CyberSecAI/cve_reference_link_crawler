- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV) may lead to a collision of IVs with the same key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a weak/predictable IV generation scheme in cryptographic operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure due to potential decryption with the same IV and key.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker needs to be able to observe or influence the cryptographic process, possibly by injecting data or using side-channel attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to intercept and analyze encrypted data streams.
