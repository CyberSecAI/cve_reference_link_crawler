```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication checks in the exportFile.jsp page of the OpenClinic GA web application.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unauthenticated file download. The application fails to implement necessary authentication checks before allowing file downloads.
- Impact of exploitation: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the application's files, undermining confidentiality and integrity, potentially leading to further attacks on the system and its users.
- Attack vectors: Direct access to the vulnerable URL (http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/pharmacy/exportFile.jsp) via a web browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: No special capabilities are required. An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application instance and knowledge of the vulnerable URL. The attacker does not require any form of authentication.
