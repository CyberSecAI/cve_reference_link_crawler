# CVE-2023-40276: Unauthenticated File Download Vulnerability in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

## Abstract

An Unauthenticated File Download vulnerability has been discovered in OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01. This security flaw resides in the pharmacy/exportFile.jsp component, permitting unauthorized users to download sensitive files without authentication, posing a significant risk to the confidentiality and integrity of the system.

## Identification

CVE ID: CVE-2023-40276

Exploit Title: Unauthenticated File Download in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

Date Discovered: 2023-08-14

Affected Software: OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01

Vendor: OpenClinic

Software Link: [SourceForge Project Page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-clinic/)

Tested Environments: Windows 10, Windows 11

## Vulnerability Details

This vulnerability is present in the exportFile.jsp page of the OpenClinic GA web application, which fails to implement necessary authentication checks before allowing the download of files. This flaw grants attackers the ability to access and download potentially sensitive files without any form of user verification.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Steps to Reproduce:

```
1. Identifying the Vulnerable Component:
  The vulnerability is located within the exportFile.jsp component of the OpenClinic GA application. Access is typically attempted through the URL http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/pharmacy/exportFile.jsp.

2. Accessing the Vulnerable URL:
  Using a web browser, navigate to the aforementioned URL. Replace [IP] with the actual IP address or domain where OpenClinic GA is installed.

3. Executing the Attack:
  Direct access to the exportFile.jsp URL does not require authentication. The absence of login credential requests or session checks allows the immediate download of files.

```

## Impact

The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the application's files, undermining the confidentiality and integrity of the information and potentially leading to further attacks on the system and its users.
