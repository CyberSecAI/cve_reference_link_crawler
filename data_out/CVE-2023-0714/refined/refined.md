This can allow double extension attacks to be used for uploading malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in versions of the Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder plugin up to and including 3.2.4. Version 3.3.0 and later contain fixes for this vulnerability.",
