- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unprivileged users can access unencrypted user credentials due to inadequate file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can gain access to credentials used for integration with third-party systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through local access to the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires local access to the device file system and must be an unprivileged user.
