Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-42197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **improper access control** in the "User List" functionality of the Simple Exam Reviewer Management System v1.0. This allows lower-privileged users to modify user permissions, escalating their own privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system does not properly restrict access to user management features, specifically the ability to edit user roles.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A lower-privileged user can elevate their access to that of an administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access Control Bypass:** Attackers can bypass intended access control restrictions.
*   **User Settings Modification:** Unauthorized users can modify user settings and permissions.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By gaining administrator privileges, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire system, including managing exams, categories, and system information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the application.
*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** The attacker directly navigates to the vulnerable page (`/admin/?page=user/list`) and manipulates the user roles through the provided edit functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileged User Account:** An attacker needs a valid low-privileged user account to log in to the system.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the system's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL (`/admin/?page=user/list`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the Simple Exam Reviewer Management System.
*   The system is built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, Bootstrap and AdminLTE.
*   The vulnerability was reported on the sourcecodester.com website as well as Github.
