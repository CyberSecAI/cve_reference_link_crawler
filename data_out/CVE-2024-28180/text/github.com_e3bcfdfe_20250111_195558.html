v3: backport decompression limit fix ([#107](https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/pull/107))

Backport from [#106](https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose/pull/106).

Note that there was a merge conflict on the CHANGELOG and I decided to
just accept all the v4 entries. It's okay for the v3 branch's CHANGELOG
to also talk about v4 releases. I'll send a separate PR updating the v4
CHANGELOG to include v3.0.3.

|  |  | # v4.0.1 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Fixed |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - An attacker could send a JWE containing compressed data that used large |
|  |  | amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by `Decrypt` or `DecryptMulti`. |
|  |  | Those functions now return an error if the decompressed data would exceed |
|  |  | 250kB or 10x the compressed size (whichever is larger). Thanks to |
|  |  | Enze Wang@Alioth and Jianjun Chen@Zhongguancun Lab (@zer0yu and @chenjj) |
|  |  | for reporting. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # v4.0.0 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This release makes some breaking changes in order to more thoroughly |
|  |  | address the vulnerabilities discussed in [Three New Attacks Against JSON Web |
|  |  | Tokens][1], "Sign/encrypt confusion", "Billion hash attack", and "Polyglot |
|  |  | token". |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Changed |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Limit JWT encryption types (exclude password or public key types) (#78) |
|  |  | - Enforce minimum length for HMAC keys (#85) |
|  |  | - jwt: match any audience in a list, rather than requiring all audiences (#81) |
|  |  | - jwt: accept only Compact Serialization (#75) |
|  |  | - jws: Add expected algorithms for signatures (#74) |
|  |  | - Require specifying expected algorithms for ParseEncrypted, |
|  |  | ParseSigned, ParseDetached, jwt.ParseEncrypted, jwt.ParseSigned, |
|  |  | jwt.ParseSignedAndEncrypted (#69, #74) |
|  |  | - Usually there is a small, known set of appropriate algorithms for a program |
|  |  | to use and it's a mistake to allow unexpected algorithms. For instance the |
|  |  | "billion hash attack" relies in part on programs accepting the PBES2 |
|  |  | encryption algorithm and doing the necessary work even if they weren't |
|  |  | specifically configured to allow PBES2. |
|  |  | - Revert "Strip padding off base64 strings" (#82) |
|  |  | - The specs require base64url encoding without padding. |
|  |  | - Minimum supported Go version is now 1.21 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Added |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - ParseSignedCompact, ParseSignedJSON, ParseEncryptedCompact, ParseEncryptedJSON. |
|  |  | - These allow parsing a specific serialization, as opposed to ParseSigned and |
|  |  | ParseEncrypted, which try to automatically detect which serialization was |
|  |  | provided. It's common to require a specific serialization for a specific |
|  |  | protocol - for instance JWT requires Compact serialization. |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | # v3.0.3 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Fixed |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Limit decompression output size to prevent a DoS. Backport from v4.0.1. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # v3.0.2 |
