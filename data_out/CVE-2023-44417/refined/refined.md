**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the DDP service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- Complete compromise of the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required.
