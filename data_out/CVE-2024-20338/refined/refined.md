- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of an uncontrolled search path element within the ISE Posture (System Scan) module of Cisco Secure Client for Linux.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path, specifically CWE-427.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with *root* privileges, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with local access can copy a malicious library file to a specific directory in the filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the system, the ability to write to a specific directory, and the ability to persuade an administrator to restart a specific process. The attacker must also be authenticated.
