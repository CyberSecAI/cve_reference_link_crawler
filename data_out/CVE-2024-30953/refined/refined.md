- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The Htmly CMS application does not properly filter user-supplied input in the "Menu Editor" module. Specifically, the "Link name" field is vulnerable to injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the manipulated menu.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Link name" field of the "Menu Editor" module. The injected code is then stored and executed when a user views the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the "Menu Editor" module in the Htmly CMS application.
