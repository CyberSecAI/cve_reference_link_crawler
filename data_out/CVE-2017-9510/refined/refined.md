- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The repository changelog resource in Atlassian FishEye does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the start date and end date parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of an authenticated user, information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript code in the start date or end date parameters of the repository changelog resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and have a victim access this URL while using the vulnerable application.
