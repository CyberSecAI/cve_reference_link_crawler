- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure occurs while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious PAR file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file.
