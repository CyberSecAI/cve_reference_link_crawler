Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32282:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper password check in the login functionality of WWBN AVideo. The `encryptPasswordVerify` function allows three different comparisons during password verification: the salted hash, the unsalted hash, and the raw hash stored in the database. The function will return true if any of these match.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of password hash for authentication**: The system allows using the stored password hash directly as the password for login, bypassing proper password verification. This occurs because the `encryptPasswordVerify` function performs an equality check against the provided password and the raw password hash from the database.
- **Insecure password verification:** The password verification logic fails to properly ensure that a password hash isn't used for authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** An attacker who obtains a user's password hash (e.g., through SQL injection) can directly log in to that user's account, potentially gaining administrative or other elevated privileges.
- **Account takeover:** Successful exploitation would lead to account takeover without knowledge of the clear text password.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can exploit any SQL injection vulnerability within the application to extract password hashes.
- **Database compromise:**  If the database is accessed through any other means, an attacker can steal password hashes.
- **Direct access to the database:** If the attacker is able to access the database directly, the attacker can steal password hashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to gain access to a user's password hash. This could be through exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability, having direct access to the database, or another attack vector that can be used to extract user passwords.
- No other special position or capabilities are required beyond this.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was found in WWBN AVideo versions 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364
- The vulnerability was fixed by the vendor on July 7th 2022.
