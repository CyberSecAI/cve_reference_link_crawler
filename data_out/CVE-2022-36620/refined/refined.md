{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/goform/addRouting` endpoint. The `netmask` parameter's content is copied into a stack buffer without any size checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Unsafe memory operations"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a denial of service (router crash) and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker crafts a malicious payload to overwrite the return address on the stack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/goform/addRouting`",
      "Sending a crafted payload as the `netmask` parameter"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface, which might require being on the same network or having gained access through other vulnerabilities.",
      "Knowledge of the required tokenid parameter (obtainable by parsing the webpage)"
    ]
