Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47461.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the userfaultfd subsystem of the Linux kernel. This race occurs between the `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` function and the `exit_mmap()` function, which is called when a process exits. Specifically, `exit_mmap()` can remove VMAs (virtual memory areas) while `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` attempts to operate on them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper synchronization between `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` and `exit_mmap()`.  The `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` function directly uses the `mm` (memory management) pointer of the context without verifying if it is still valid. This allows the mm to be freed by `exit_mmap()` while `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` is trying to use it, resulting in a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this race condition could lead to a kernel crash or other undefined behavior due to the use-after-free vulnerability, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` ioctl on a userfaultfd context while the process owning the memory is exiting.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to trigger the `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` ioctl. This implies the attacker needs to have a user process that can interact with the userfaultfd subsystem, and they must be able to trigger the process exit while also making calls to `userfaultfd_writeprotect()`. This may require local access to the system.

**Additional notes:**
The provided patches resolve this vulnerability by using `mmget_not_zero()` before accessing the `mm` pointer. `mmget_not_zero()` attempts to increment the `mm` reference count and returns the pointer only if it is still valid. This prevents `userfaultfd_writeprotect()` from operating on a memory region that is about to be freed. The reference count is decremented by `mmput()` after the operation is performed. The fix introduces a check, returning `-ESRCH` if the `mm` is no longer valid.
