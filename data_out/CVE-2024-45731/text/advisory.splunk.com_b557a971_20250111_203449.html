**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-1001

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-45731](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45731)

**Published:** 2024-10-14

**Last Update:** 2024-10-14

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 8.0, High

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CWE:** [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-16991

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise for Windows versions below 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could write a file to the Windows system root directory, which has a default location in the Windows System32 folder, when Splunk Enterprise for Windows is installed on a separate drive. The user could potentially write a malicious DLL which, if loaded, could result in a remote execution of the code within that DLL.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, or higher.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.3 | Splunk Web | 9.3.0 | 9.3.1 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | Splunk Web | 9.2.0 to 9.2.2 | 9.2.3 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | Splunk Web | 9.1.0 to 9.1.5 | 9.1.6 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as 8.0, High, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

If the Splunk Enterprise instance is not installed on a separate disk, there is no impact and the severity would be informational.
