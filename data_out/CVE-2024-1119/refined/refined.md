### CVE-2024-1119

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `export_tips_to_csv()` function of the Order Tip for WooCommerce plugin. This function, intended for exporting order tip data to a CSV file, lacks proper authorization controls, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger the export.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization: The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before executing the data export function.
- Unauthenticated access: This missing check allows any user, even those not logged into the WordPress site, to trigger the export function and gain access to sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exposure: An attacker can export the plugin's order fees, potentially exposing sensitive financial information and customer order details.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. Specifically, the `export_tips_to_csv()` function can be triggered by sending a request to `admin.php?page=wc-reports&tab=order_tip&a=export` with the necessary parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They can be any anonymous user with network access to the vulnerable website.
