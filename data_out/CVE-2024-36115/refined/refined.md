Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Reposilite application. It stems from the fact that Reposilite serves artifact content through the same origin as the admin UI. When an artifact contains HTML with embedded JavaScript, that script is executed in the user's browser within the context of the same origin, granting it access to browser's local storage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious HTML/JavaScript within an artifact can be executed in the context of the Reposilite web application when a user views the artifact's content.
- **Lack of Content Isolation:** The application does not properly isolate the rendering of artifact content from the primary web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Token Leakage:** An attacker can steal the user's `token-secret` (password) stored in the browser's local storage.
- **Full Instance Compromise:** With the stolen token, an attacker can gain administrative access, modify settings and artifacts, and potentially achieve remote code execution on systems using artifacts from the compromised Reposilite instance.
- **Unnoticeable Attack:**  The attack can be carried out silently as the malicious script can be loaded along with other HTML content, making it difficult to detect.
- **Internal Network Exploitation:**  Even if the Reposilite instance is in an isolated environment, it is still vulnerable as the attack occurs from the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can deliver the malicious payload over the network.
- **Malicious Artifact:** The attacker creates a malicious artifact containing HTML with JavaScript. This artifact is then hosted within the repository (potentially by mirroring from an external repository like Maven Central).
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to access and view the malicious artifact within their browser. This could be an administrator or other authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and publish a malicious artifact in a repository that is accessible to the vulnerable Reposilite instance. This could be achieved by either uploading to the instance directly, or through the instance mirroring a malicious external repository (such as a manipulated mirror of Maven Central).
- The attacker must lure an authenticated user into accessing the malicious artifact's content through their web browser.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Reposilite between 3.3.0 and 3.5.11.
- The fix for the vulnerability was introduced in version 3.5.12.
- The vulnerability is identified as `GHSL-2024-072` and assigned `CVE-2024-36115`.
- The fix implemented the use of the `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` header to isolate the artifact content, and prevent the execution of the malicious javascript.
- The advisory also recommends to avoid storing user passwords in the browser local storage.
