|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | Default configurations in the ShareProofVerifier function of filestash |
|  | v0.4 causes the application to skip the TLS certificate verification |
|  | process when sending out email verification codes, possibly allowing |
|  | attackers to access sensitive data via a man-in-the-middle attack. |
|  |  |
|  | In the current implementation of the ShareProofVerifier function within share.go |
|  | found at github.com/m/mickael-kerjean/filestash/server/model, |
|  | the TLS verification is being bypassed when sending out email |
|  | verification codes. This practice is explicitly warned against in |
|  | the gomail package documentation, stating that it is insecure and |
|  | should not be used in a production environment. |
