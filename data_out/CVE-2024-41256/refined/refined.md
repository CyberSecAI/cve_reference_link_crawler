{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ShareProofVerifier function in filestash v0.4 skips TLS certificate verification when sending email verification codes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing SSL certificate validation when sending email verification codes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can potentially access sensitive data transmitted during email verification, leading to privilege escalation and information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via the email authentication mechanism.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic during the email verification process (man-in-the-middle attack)."
