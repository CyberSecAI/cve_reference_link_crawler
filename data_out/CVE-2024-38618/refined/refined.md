Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which are all related to the same fix:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ALSA timer in the Linux kernel did not enforce a lower limit on the start tick time. This allowed a very small timer start size (e.g., 1 tick with 1ns resolution for hrtimer).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation on the timer start tick time.
- The ability to set extremely small timer intervals could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An extremely small timer setting could result in an RCU stall. This happens when a timer callback repeatedly queues an update, preventing the RCU grace period from completing.
- This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service by stalling the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could use a crafted application or system call to set a very small start tick time on the ALSA timer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate ALSA timers and set their properties.
- This could be a local user with the necessary privileges, or, potentially, a remote attacker if the system has a way for remote interaction with the sound subsystem.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces a hard-coded lower limit of 100us for the start tick time. This prevents the system from accepting excessively small start times.
- The provided commits represent backports of the fix to various kernel versions.
- The fix is a sanity check to ensure a minimum time for the timer, preventing RCU stalls.
- The fix was reported by syzbot, indicating that the issue was discovered through fuzzing.
- Error handling is slightly different in some of the backported commits, as noted in the descriptions, due to recent changes in the code.
