The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gila CMS version 1.11.3, which aligns with the nature of CVE-2020-20523.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization of the `adm_user` parameter during the installation process in `install/install.sql.php`. User-provided data from the `adm_user` field is directly inserted into the database without proper filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a classic reflected XSS. The application fails to neutralize user-controllable input before including it in the output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the `adm_user` field during the installation process. When this data is later displayed in the admin panel or other locations, the script would execute in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to: session hijacking, defacement of the application or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious payload and submitting it through the `adm_user` input field during the installation of Gila CMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to access and execute the installation process of Gila CMS. This implies that the attacker would need to access the web application installer before the CMS is fully setup, meaning the attacker could be a malicious actor or the legitimate administrator during installation.

The vulnerability was reported to be fixed in version 1.11.4
