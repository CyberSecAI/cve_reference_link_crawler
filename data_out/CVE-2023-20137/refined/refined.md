- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information by persuading a user to visit a crafted web page.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the affected device and persuade a user to visit a specific crafted web page containing the malicious payload. This implies a remote, unauthenticated attacker.
