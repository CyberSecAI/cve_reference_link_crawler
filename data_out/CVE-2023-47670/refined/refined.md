- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Korea SNS Plugin <= 1.6.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin, an attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page to perform the forged request. The attacker does not need prior authentication on the vulnerable site.
