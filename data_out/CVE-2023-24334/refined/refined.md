Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `schedStartTime` parameter from the HTTP request is copied to a stack buffer without proper size validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked copy of user-supplied data.
- Lack of input sanitization and size limitation when handling the `schedStartTime` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the affected Tenda AC23 router.
- Potential privilege escalation to root.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially leading to complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
- The `schedStartTime` parameter is used as the overflow vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the Tenda AC23 router's web interface.
- Ability to craft HTTP POST requests with a sufficiently long `schedStartTime` value to cause the buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

- The affected firmware version is US_AC23V1.0re_V16.03.07.45_cn_TDC01.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- Exploitation can lead to a stable root shell on the device.
- The vulnerability is located in the handling of the `schedStartTime` parameter in `openSchedWifi` function.
