- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SSL-VPN web portal fails to sanitize the login `redir` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and URL Redirection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands and potentially redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the `redir` parameter in the SSL-VPN web portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `redir` parameter in the SSL-VPN web portal URL. No specific user privileges are required, as the vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the input parameter.
