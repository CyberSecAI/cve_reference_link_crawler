Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the `sub_4901E0` function, specifically within the `msp_info.htm` file. The `httpd_get_parm` function retrieves a parameter which is later used in a `sprintf` function. This concatenated string is then executed by the `system` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands via the `cmd` parameter due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the device. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, including:
  - **Data exfiltration**
  - **Device takeover**
  - **Malware installation**
  - **Denial of service**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/msp_info.htm` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the value of the `flag` parameter to `cmd`, and supplying shell commands via the `cmd` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
- **Understanding of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/msp_info.htm`) and the required parameters (`flag=cmd` and `cmd`).
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
- **Authentication:** While the provided PoC includes cookies, the text implies that the vulnerability can be triggered by providing the required parameters, which suggests that the vulnerability is present both with and without authentication. This would need further verification.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `sub_4901E0` function of the firmware.
- The `httpd_get_parm` function retrieves the value of a parameter which is later concatenated into a string that will be passed to `system`.
- The value `cmd` is used to enable the vulnerable code path.
- The `sprintf` function concatenates user supplied data with another value, which is then executed by the `system` command.

**Firmware Version:**
- WAYOS:FBM_292W-21.03.10V

**Additional Details**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a GET request with a malicious `cmd` parameter, which is then executed by the system. The PoC specifically shows how to use the parameter to write the results of `ps` to `a.txt`.
