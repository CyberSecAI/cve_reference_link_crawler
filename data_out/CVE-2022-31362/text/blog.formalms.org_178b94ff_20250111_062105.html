## Life after docebo: the Forma project begins

Details

Published: 18 October 2013

A group of companies active in the elearning and web developement sector decided to continue the abandoned open source version of the LMS "Docebo", in order to mantain its open spirit and give its users a new community.

A new identity

Since "Docebo" is the registered trademark of the commercial cloud version of the original software, a new brand identity was designed for the new project, collecting the ideas and preferences of almost 50 people: the new name for the future open source releases of the software will be "**Forma Lms**".

A solid project

In its new life as "Forma Lms" the platform won't be mantained by a single company, but by a group of companies collaborating and sharing their elearning experiences and technical skills to keep it alive and make it grow: while working on the realization of the first release of Forma Lms, the partners tried to build also (or mainly) a solid collaboration workflow and infrastructure, to guarantee stability and continuity of the whole project.

The new release

A **first new version of the software** is ready and will be officialy released within a few days. This first release is based on the last available open source package of Docebo (4.0.5 Community Edition), but will feature more than 70 modifications in bugfixes and new features: all the fixes shared by the "elearning community" are included, toghether with several changes and fixes developed by the partners for their clients.

Maybe in this very first release you won't find big functional changes, but we hope you will appreciate all the work done to improve the existing and give it a new life and a new credibility, while mantaining it Free and Open Source. It is anyway a wide update, including the possibility of **DIRECT UPGRADE FROM PREVIOUS DOCEBO VERSIONS**.

We want this to be the first step of a long journey, with the vital and active partecipation of the community that made it possible. Thanks!
