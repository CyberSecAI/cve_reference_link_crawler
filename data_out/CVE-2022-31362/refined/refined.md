Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Docebo Community Edition <= 4.0.5:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the application allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization and parameterization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to the application's database.
        *   Data exfiltration or modification.
        *   Potential for gaining access to user credentials (hashed).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote unauthenticated attacker.

2.  **Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows uploading files without proper validation of file types and content.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient checks on uploaded file types.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Command Execution by uploading malicious files like a PHP webshell.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading large files.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the avatar upload feature (or potentially other upload features) to upload malicious files.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid account with the ability to upload files (authenticated user).

**Summary of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit the unauthenticated SQL injection to potentially extract hashed credentials, then use these credentials (if cracked) to log in as a legitimate user. Once authenticated, the attacker can exploit the arbitrary file upload vulnerability to upload a webshell, thereby achieving remote code execution.

**Remediation:**

The advisory recommends the following:

*   **For SQL Injection:**
    *   Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.
    *   Use stored procedures.
    *   Validate and escape all user inputs used in queries.
    *   Perform timely checks on all database queries for similar vulnerabilities.

*   **For Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Whitelist allowed file types for upload based on the business logic of the application.
    *   Block and notify administrators of uploads of file types that could be interpreted and executed by the web server (e.g., PHP, ASP, etc.).

**Additional Notes:**
* The content also provides evidence of the SQL injection using time-based blind technique.
* The content contains a complete breakdown of the exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability, including evidence of the steps and request.
* The content also provides external references to OWASP and MITRE resources
