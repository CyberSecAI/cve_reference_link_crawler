*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to arbitrary data from the Xibo database.
*   **Data Modification:**  The vulnerability also allows modification of arbitrary data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the DataSet feature within Xibo CMS.
*   **Privileges:** The attacker requires access to the DataSet feature in Xibo CMS.
