- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input in shortcode attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page/post, which will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the page/post. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious shortcode with injected javascript in shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least the "contributor" role.
