{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to write to `/proc/pid/mem` which is enabled by default in the Linux kernel. This allows a process to modify its own memory, even memory that is marked as non-writable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Access Control (CWE-284). The ability of a process to write to its own memory via `/proc/pid/mem`, even when the memory is marked as read-only, bypasses intended memory protection mechanisms.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shellcode by overwriting parts of the program's memory via `/proc/self/mem`. This allows an attacker to gain control of the compromised application.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the compromised application is required. The attacker needs to leverage the `/proc/self/mem` file to write shellcode into the application's memory space.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have already compromised an application running on the Azure Sphere device. The attacker requires the ability to execute code within this application in order to exploit the vulnerability by writing to `/proc/self/mem` using ROP gadgets."
