Initial research efforts were predominantly concentrated on unpacking the well-disguised attack vector, while the social aspects of the attack received only murmurings. To investigate this attack, I never read a line of code. Instead, I spent dozens of hours pouring over hundreds of discussion threads and mailing lists. I’ve concluded that while the events that unfolded are undoubtedly a tragedy, it was one of our own making — one of an ugly reality that quietly plays out every day. Our attacker was not naïve. They meticulously examined the culture of open source and then pounced on its norms, twisting them strategically to their benefit. If we continue to focus purely on technicalities, nothing will ever change. This story will play out time and time again, like it already has for decades. We must stop focusing on fuzzing and static analysis and instead turn our attention to the human costs of open source. We must learn. With this in mind, I present a timeline of the attack — one from a new perspective that’s too often ignored.</p><h3 id="2021" tabindex="-1">2021</h3><p>JiaT75 (Jia Tan) creates their GitHub account.</p><p>The first commits they make are not to xz, but they are deeply suspicious.
