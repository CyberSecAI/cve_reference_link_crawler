Subject: Re: backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma leading to ssh server compromise

Hi,

This is an update on some developments in the recent 2 weeks.

OpenSSH
=======

For upstream OpenSSH, Damien Miller and others have implemented systemd
notifications without reliance on libsystemd:

Bug 2641 - Add systemd notify code to to track running server
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2641" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2641</a>

"Committed as 08f579231cd38 and will be in OpenSSH-9.8, due around
June/July."

In response to Andres Freund's proposal, Damien also implemented a patch
to reduce OpenSSH's attack surface:

Bug 3675 - CASignatureAlgorithms should be verified before verifying signatures
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3675" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3675</a>

not yet committed?

systemd
=======

Upstream systemd's libsystemd has been modified to dlopen() many of its
dependency libraries on demand:

Reduce dependencies of libsystemd #32028
<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/32028" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/32028</a>

The issue above is fixed by pull requests "gcrypt: dlopenify for
libsystemd #32019", "Dynamically load compression libraries #31550",
"man: document that using sd_journal APIs might cause dlopen to happen
and add self-contained notify protocol example #32030", and other
related fix-ups.

xz backdoor analysis
====================

More findings were made about the backdoor's functionality, notably as
published on April 6 by blasty, who discovered that besides triggering
system() the backdoor also allows interactive sessions:

<a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty/status/1776691497506623562" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/bl4sty/status/1776691497506623562</a>

&gt; the xz sshd backdoor rabbithole goes quite a bit deeper. I was just able
&gt; to trigger some harder to reach functionality of the backdoor. there's
&gt; still more to explore.. 1/n
&gt; Image
&gt; it requires sending a properly crafted command to the RSA_public_decrypt
&gt; hook, which will then install another for the `mm_answer_keyallowed`
&gt; sshd function. subsequently you offer N more fake ssh-rsa pubkeys which
&gt; are crafted in a special way to chunk together .. 2/n
&gt; a "magic buffer" which contains more backdoor commands, this buffer also
&gt; has two additional ed448 signatures. which like the ones for the
&gt; RSA_public_decrypt portion of the backdoor are salted with the SHA256
&gt; digest of the hostkey
&gt; the final signature also takes into account the session_id (0x20 bytes)
&gt; that is derived during the initial key exchange (KEX) for the SSH
&gt; session. my current PoC implementation uses a heavily monkey patched
&gt; paramiko (ssh client) library to achieve this
&gt; currently I'm just triggering command 0x03 in this part of the code,
&gt; which allows for a basic RCE through system() again. (also lets you set
&gt; uid/gid). but there's more code that needs to be understood. it looks
&gt; like a full auth bypass (interactive session) is possible!
&gt; (that conclusion is based on the fact that one of the
&gt; mm_answer_keyallowed backdoor commands also hooks mm_answer_keyverify,
&gt; eventually)
&gt; whoever designed this stuff had to take a deep dive into openSSH(d)
&gt; internals (and so did I for the past couple of days, oof) .. hats off,
&gt; once again :)
&gt; auth bypass confirmed!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; INFO:paramiko.transport:Authentication (password) successful!
&gt; 
&gt; mm_keyallowed_backdoor cmd 1 allows to override the response for
&gt; mm_answer_authpassword with a custom one. if you set it to { u32(9),
&gt; u8(13), u32(1), u32(0) } you can login with any pass

blasty also implemented a "simple SSH Agent that implements some of the
XZ sshd backdoor functionality":

&gt; 
&gt; I've attached the gist .md file above (as of "Revisions 52") to this
&gt; message, but it's ongoing analysis as seen in the comments.

Updates of smx-smx's gist above have stopped at revision 60, which I'm
attaching here for archival.  Not a lot was added since revision 52.

smx-smx also maintains xzre "that is linked against the malicious object
file in order to instrument and call into the malware code, particularly
the x64 disassembler":

<a href="https://github.com/smx-smx/xzre" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/smx-smx/xzre</a>

and yes, there's a specialized disassembler inside the backdoor code.

The friends at Binarly have produced a later but very detailed analysis,
which I'm also attaching the main .md file of:

<a href="https://github.com/binarly-io/binary-risk-intelligence/tree/master/xz-backdoor" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/binarly-io/binary-risk-intelligence/tree/master/xz-backdoor</a>

Other related repos with tools include:

xzbot "notes, honeypot, and exploit demo for the xz backdoor (CVE-2024-3094)"
<a href="https://github.com/amlweems/xzbot" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/amlweems/xzbot</a>

xz-min "Minimal setup to trigger the xz backdoor"
<a href="https://github.com/felipec/xz-min" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/felipec/xz-min</a>

Timeline
========

In an otherwise inappropriate rejected posting, Steffen Nurpmeso wrote:

&gt; Russ Cox had a writeup on this <a href="https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline" rel="nofollow">https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline</a>

which is a good presentation of the attack timeline, with references to
sources and analyses by others.

(The beginning of this oss-security thread until April 1st inclusive
went through in its entirety - nothing rejected - but I did reject a few
postings on April 2nd and on.)

OpenJS Foundation "Failed Credible Takeover Attempt"
====================================================

On April 15, the OpenJS and OpenSSF foundations released the following:

<a href="https://openjsf.org/blog/openssf-openjs-alert-social-engineering-takeovers" rel="nofollow">https://openjsf.org/blog/openssf-openjs-alert-social-engineering-takeovers</a>
<a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2024/04/15/open-source-security-openssf-and-openjs-foundations-issue-alert-for-social-engineering-takeovers-of-open-source-projects/" rel="nofollow">https://openssf.org/blog/2024/04/15/open-source-security-openssf-and-openjs-foundations-issue-alert-for-social-engineering-takeovers-of-open-source-projects/</a>

I'll quote an excerpt:

&gt; The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council received a suspicious series
&gt; of emails with similar messages, bearing different names and overlapping
&gt; GitHub-associated emails. These emails implored OpenJS to take action to
&gt; update one of its popular JavaScript projects to "address any critical
&gt; vulnerabilities," yet cited no specifics. The email author(s) wanted
&gt; OpenJS to designate them as a new maintainer of the project despite
&gt; having little prior involvement. This approach bears strong resemblance
&gt; to the manner in which "Jia Tan" positioned themselves in the XZ/liblzma
&gt; backdoor.
&gt; 
&gt; None of these individuals have been given privileged access to the
&gt; OpenJS-hosted project. The project has security policies in place,
&gt; including those outlined by the Foundation's security working group.
&gt; 
&gt; The OpenJS team also recognized a similar suspicious pattern in two
&gt; other popular JavaScript projects not hosted by its Foundation, and
&gt; immediately flagged the potential security concerns to respective OpenJS
&gt; leaders, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
&gt; within the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
