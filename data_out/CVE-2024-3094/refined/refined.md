**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability arises from a backdoored version of the xz-utils library, specifically in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.
    *   The malicious code was injected into the release tarballs through a modified `build-to-host.m4` file, which is used during the `configure` process of the build system. This modified script introduces a series of obfuscated commands.
    *   These commands extract a prebuilt object file (liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o) from disguised test files within the repository. This object file is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code during the build process.
    *   The injected code replaces ifunc resolvers for `crc32_resolve()` and `crc64_resolve()` with malicious code, which then replaces a call to RSA\_public\_decrypt in OpenSSL. This is done by using a dynamic linker audit hook and overwriting entries in the .plt of programs that used it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Supply chain vulnerability:** The attack exploits the trust placed in the upstream maintainers and the build process, injecting malicious code into distribution tarballs.
    *   **Code injection:** The modified `build-to-host.m4` file executes obfuscated shell scripts that manipulate the build process and inject malicious code into liblzma.
    *   **Dynamic linking vulnerability:** The attack exploits the dynamic linking process on Linux to replace a legitimate cryptographic function with a malicious implementation. This is made possible by loading ifunc resolvers prior to read-only remapping of the Global Offset Table.
    *   **Obfuscation:** The malicious code was initially obfuscated and spread across multiple files, making detection difficult.
    *   **Dependency Exploitation:** A weakness in how certain distributions were linking to libsystemd, and libsystemd's dependency on liblzma, was also exploited to load the malicious code into the process space of sshd.
    *   **Targeted Execution:** The exploit is designed to run only on x86-64 Linux systems using glibc, further narrowing the vulnerability scope and complicating analysis.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most critical impact is the possibility of remote code execution (RCE) by injecting an encrypted payload through a specially crafted SSH certificate.
    *   **SSH Server Compromise:** The attack aims to target the `RSA_public_decrypt` function within sshd, an OpenSSH server daemon. When the exploit is activated, the compromised sshd might allow unauthorized access, bypassing the security measures.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass user authentication, gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Malware Execution:** A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system with the privileges of the sshd process.
    *   **Possible further changes:** The attacker installed an dynamic loader hook to rewrite pointers. It is very likely more changes were done which are not yet fully analyzed.
    *   **Slowed Logins:** Affected versions of `liblzma` cause logins via ssh to be slower, as the inserted code searches through the symbol tables in memory to find the `RSA_public_decrypt` symbol.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Compromised Tarballs:** The initial attack vector is through the release tarballs of xz-utils, which contain a modified build script.
    *   **Infected Test Files:** The bulk of the exploit is delivered via specially crafted "test files" within the xz-utils project.
    *   **Malicious Build Chain:** The malicious script is executed during the configure step, which then injects a malicious .o file into the build process. This allows the malware to hook the dynamic loading process by replacing the `crc32_resolve` and `crc64_resolve` functions.
    *  **Dynamic Linking:** The vulnerability depends on the dynamic linking process used by Linux and glibc.
    *  **Dependency Chain:** The attack path relies on sshd being patched to use systemd notifications, which in turn depends on libsystemd, which depends on liblzma, all of which have to be loaded into the same process space.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the private key corresponding to a hardcoded public key, in order to create the exploit payload that bypasses authentication.
    *   The attacker needs access to the build system to modify the `build-to-host.m4` file in the release tarballs and to include malicious test files.
    *   The attacker also needed some level of commit/maintainer access to the xz project. The attacker likely used social engineering techniques to gain trust from other project members and obtain elevated privileges.
    *  The exploit required the use of a Linux system using glibc, with x86-64.

**3. Additional Details from Analyzed Content:**

*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   The attacker used sockpuppet accounts to pressure the original maintainer into adding a co-maintainer and a seemingly legitimate patch for hardware support functions which enabled the attack.
    *   The attacker also attempted to get vulnerable versions of XZ Utils included in Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu releases via seemingly legitimate update requests (Hans Jansen) and also by creating fake user accounts to push for the update based on non-existent issues like the reported valgrind errors.
    *   The attacker updated the main contact email in Googleâ€™s oss-fuzz to be their own, and also moved the project website to GitHub pages to gain more control.
    *   The original maintainer, Lasse Collin, was likely targeted because of their mental health issues and subsequent burnout.
    *   Several suspicious accounts such as Jigar Kumar, Dennis Ens, misoeater91 and krygorin4545 were identified which all pushed for the changes from Jia Tan to be accepted and for the new 5.6 releases to be deployed.
*   **Obfuscation Techniques:**
    *   The attacker used multiple layers of obfuscation. First, the payload was embedded in test files using specific byte patterns.
    *   Next, shell commands (`tr`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`, `xz -d`) were used to carve, decrypt, and decompress the data to be used as a next stage.
    *   Finally, the injected code used ifuncs to perform runtime patching, making it harder to trace where the backdoored code was actually executed, and it tried to identify and avoid running in debugging environments.
    *   The payload code contained a state automaton to recognize strings, instead of storing the string in memory directly.
*   **System Requirements and Exploitation:**
    *   The exploit is limited to x86-64 Linux systems using glibc, which are being compiled with gcc and GNU ld, and running sshd with systemd notifications enabled.
    *   The backdoor code looks for /usr/sbin/sshd in `argv[0]`.
    *   The backdoor requires that the `TERM` environment variable is not set, and that `LD_DEBUG` and `LD_PROFILE` are not set. The `LANG` environment variable must be set.
*  **Detection:**
    *   A simple detection script was developed by Vegard Nossum, which checks for the presence of the modified `_get_cpuid()` in the `liblzma` library.
    *   `perf` can also be used to observe where execution diverges when the backdoor is active.
    *   The presence of the backdoored code can also be detected by checksumming the `liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o` file.

**4.  Gaps in Information:**

*   The exact payload of the backdoor, beyond redirecting `RSA_public_decrypt` function and allowing RCE via `system()`, is not fully understood, particularly as to how the attacker would gain access to a system using it. It is suspected that further changes might occur at runtime.
*   The exact reasons why certain design choices were made, like using Ed448 instead of Ed25519 for the signing keys, or why they decided to specifically target those methods of authentication rather than implementing a direct authentication bypass, are still not fully understood and remain open for further investigation.
