# Azure RTOS USBX Host PIMA read integer underflow with buffer overflow

High

[liydu](/liydu)
published
GHSA-gg76-h537-xq48
Oct 12, 2022

## Package

USBX
(Azure RTOS)

## Affected versions

< 6.1.12

## Patched versions

6.1.12

## Description

### Impact

The case is, in [\_ux\_host\_class\_pima\_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header\_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a “if” branch, which check the expression of “(header\_length - UX\_HOST\_CLASS\_PIMA\_DATA\_HEADER\_SIZE) > data\_length” where if header\_length is smaller than UX\_HOST\_CLASS\_PIMA\_DATA\_HEADER\_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data\_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data\_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow.

### Patches

We analyzed this bug and determined that we needed to fix it. This fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel)

### Workarounds

Add check of `header_length`:

1. It must be greater than `UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE`.
2. It should be greater or equal to the current returned data length (`transfer_request -> ux_transfer_request_actual_length`).
