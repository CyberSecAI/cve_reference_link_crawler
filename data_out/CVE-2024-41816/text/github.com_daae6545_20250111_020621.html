# WordPress Cooked Plugin <= 1.8.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode

Moderate

[XjSv](/XjSv)
published
GHSA-3gw3-2qjq-xqjj
Aug 4, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.8.0

## Patched versions

1.8.1

## Description

## Description:

The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the ‘[cooked-timer]’ shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page.

## Payload:

`[cooked-timer minutes="8" desc="XSS<img/src=z onerror=alert(origin);//"]8 Minutes[/cooked-timer]`

## Steps to reproduce:

[0] Install & activate the plugin.

[1] Add a recipe ‘/wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=cp\_recipe’.

[2] Use your payload in the Recipe Template text box.

[3] Publish the recipe.

[4] Injected payload will trigger on the newly created recipe page.

## PoC request:

```

Host: target.tld
Cookie: [subscriber_cookies]

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
