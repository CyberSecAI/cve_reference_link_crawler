**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly neutralize special elements in user input to the `ssmctl-client` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Command injection (CWE-77). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input to the `ssmctl-client` command, which allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated, lowly privileged local attacker can execute privileged commands on the underlying OS. This could allow the attacker to gain full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access to the affected system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the local system running the vulnerable application.
