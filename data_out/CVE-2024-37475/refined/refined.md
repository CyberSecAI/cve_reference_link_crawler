- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be limited to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, a missing authorization check that allows unauthenticated users to perform privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is described as low, and the specific impact can vary. However, in general, it means that an unauthenticated user can perform actions they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a function that lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
