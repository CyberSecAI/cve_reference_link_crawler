Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Account Settings page in Liferay Portal and DXP embeds the user's hashed password within the HTML source code of the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Exposure of sensitive information: The hashed password, which is meant to be a secret, is being directly exposed in the HTML source.
*   Man-in-the-middle (MitM) vulnerability: An attacker performing a MitM attack can intercept network traffic and extract the hashed password from the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Compromised user accounts: If an attacker obtains the hashed password, they could potentially use it for brute force attacks or other techniques to gain access to the user's account.
*   Loss of confidentiality: Exposure of the hashed password itself represents a loss of confidentiality and potentially allows the attacker to attempt password cracking

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Attackers positioned between the user and the Liferay server can intercept network traffic and steal the hashed password from the HTML.
*  Network sniffing: Attackers on the same network as a user could sniff network traffic to obtain the user's hashed password

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access: The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the Liferay server. This could involve being on the same network, compromising a network device, or using other MitM techniques.
*   User interaction is not required, as the vulnerability is exposed when the user accesses the account settings page.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.76 through 7.4.3.99
*   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3 before patch 5
*   Liferay DXP 7.4 update 76 through 92

**Fixed Versions:**
*   Liferay Portal 7.4.3.100
*   Liferay DXP 2023.Q3.5

**CVSS Score:** 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

This CVSS vector indicates:
*   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
*   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
*  **PR:L (Low):** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability
*   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
*   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability scope is unchanged
*   **C:H (High):** The impact on confidentiality is high.
*   **I:N (None):** There is no impact on integrity.
*   **A:N (None):** There is no impact on availability.
