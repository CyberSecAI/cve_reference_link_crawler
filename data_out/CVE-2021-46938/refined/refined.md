  "cveId": "CVE-2021-46938",
  "related": true,
  "cveDescription": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `blk_mq_tag_set` pointer is not set to NULL in the error handling of `dm_mq_init_request_queue()` after the `blk_mq_tag_set` is freed. Also, the pointer is not set to NULL in `dm_mq_cleanup_mapped_device()` after the `blk_mq_tag_set` is freed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Double free vulnerability due to the failure to NULLify the pointer after freeing the memory associated with it.",
         "Improper resource management leading to use-after-free conditions"
      ],
      "impact": "A double free occurs leading to a kernel panic.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Loading a device-mapper table for a request-based mapped device, where the allocation/initialization of `blk_mq_tag_set` fails.",
        "Subsequently removing the device will lead to the double free"
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to load a device mapper table, and cause the allocation of `blk_mq_tag_set` to fail."
