- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Most And Least Read Posts Widget plugin versions <= 2.5.18 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the user can perform.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into triggering the request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
