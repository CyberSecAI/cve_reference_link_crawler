Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1960

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Special Day Offer" widget of the ShopLentor plugin. Specifically, the `banner_link` URL and `banner_badge_image` URL are not properly sanitized when rendering the widget's output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied data in the `banner_link` and `banner_badge_image` fields before storing it in the database.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** When rendering the widget on a page, the stored, unsanitized data is output directly without proper escaping, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `banner_link` or `banner_badge_image` fields. When a user views a page where the "Special Day Offer" widget is displayed, this script will execute in their browser.
- **Account Takeover/Malicious Actions:** The injected JavaScript could be used to perform various malicious actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing pages, or modifying content on the page.
- **Compromised Website:** A successful XSS attack can lead to a broader compromise of the website, potentially affecting all users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin's Widget Settings:** An attacker would need to gain access to the plugin settings of the "Special Day Offer" widget.
- **Malicious Input:** They then inject malicious JavaScript code into the `banner_link` URL or `banner_badge_image` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User (Contributor+):** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level permissions in WordPress to access the vulnerable plugin settings.

**More Details:**

- The vulnerability is located within the `special_day_offer.php` file of the `woolentor-addons` plugin.
- The vulnerable code is found around line 784 (for the `banner_link` URL) and line 805 (for the `banner_badge_image` URL).
- The fix involves using `esc_url()` to properly escape the output of these URLs.
- The affected versions of the plugin are ShopLentor (formerly WooLentor) versions up to and including 2.8.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.2.
