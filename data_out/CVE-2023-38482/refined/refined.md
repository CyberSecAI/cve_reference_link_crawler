This could lead to various negative impacts, including redirection to malicious sites or the deployment of unwanted content.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious scripts can be injected through the plugin. The specific injection points are not detailed in this document, but successful exploitation would involve an attacker injecting crafted scripts that are then rendered by a user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script. While not explicitly stated, this vulnerability likely requires an authenticated user (with at least administrator privileges) to inject the malicious script through the plugin's interface or functionality.
