  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2023-44273",
    "description": "The provided content relates to a fix for a malleability issue in the gnark-crypto library, specifically in the ECDSA and EdDSA signature deserialization process. This is directly related to CVE-2023-44273.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that the deserialization process for ECDSA and EdDSA signatures did not ensure that the data was within the valid range [0, mod], where 'mod' is the relevant modulus (field of definition of relevant group size of the curve). This allowed for malleable signatures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Malleability in signature deserialization",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker could create malleable signatures. This could lead to the acceptance of invalid signatures or the manipulation of signature data, potentially causing issues with data integrity and authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating signature bytes during deserialization."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the byte representation of the signature before or during the deserialization process."
