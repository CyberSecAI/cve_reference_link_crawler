fix crsf\_rc: prevent potential buffer overflow for unknown packets

```
The length check for unknown packets did not include PACKET_SIZE_TYPE_SIZE
and CRC_SIZE, and hence working_index could overflow CRSF_MAX_PACKET_LEN,
triggering invalid memory access further down in QueueBuffer_PeekBuffer.

Also the working_segment_size was wrong for unknown packets.

Credits for finding this go to [@Pwn9uin](https://github.com/Pwn9uin).
