- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection when updating its settings, and it does not sanitize or escape user-supplied input when saving the settings to the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which will then be executed in the context of the admin's browser when the admin views those settings in the WordPress admin panel, leading to complete compromise of the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is initiated by tricking a logged-in admin user into submitting a malicious form using CSRF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin user to submit a crafted form to update plugin settings. The attacker does not need to be logged in.
