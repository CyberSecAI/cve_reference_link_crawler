{
  "CVE-2024-35181": {
    "root_cause": "The `order` and `sort` query parameters in the `/api/system/meshync/resources/kinds` and `/api/v2/events` endpoints are directly used to build SQL queries without proper sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file write using SQL injection stacked queries and the `ATTACH DATABASE` command. Access and modification of data stored in the database, including sensitive information like performance profiles (which may contain session cookies), Meshery application data, and Kubernetes configurations. Arbitrary database entries can also be created.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/api/system/meshync/resources/kinds` and `/api/v2/events` endpoints, injecting malicious SQL code into the `order` and `sort` parameters.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints. Authentication and authorization might be a factor, but unauthenticated users may still be able to trigger the vulnerability depending on the configuration."
