| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | authelia-bhf included in TwinCAT/BSD | < 4.37.5 |

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2023-6545](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-6545)

#### Last Update:

#### Severity

4.3

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') [(CWE-601)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)

#### Summary

The package authelia-bhf included in Beckhoffs TwinCAT/BSD is prone to an open redirect that allows a remote unprivileged attacker to redirect a user to another site. This may have limited impact to integrity and does solely affect anthelia-bhf the Beckhoff fork of authelia.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2023-6545)

---

#### Impact

By default TwinCAT/BSD based products have Authelia installed and configured to perform the user authentication for web applications hosted on a target. This installation and configuration is provided with the package named “authelia-bhf”. With the affected versions of the package Authelia is configured to accept user-controlled input via URL parameter that specifies a link which can then be a link to an arbitrary external site.

Please note: The sources for the package “authelia-bhf” are a fork from the original Open Source Software called “Authelia”. The vulnerability was exclusively introduced with that fork and has been removed there. It never became part of “Authelia”.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Use firewall or web-proxy technology at your network perimeter which allow internal clients to access only trusted external sites directly.

**Remediation**

Please update to a recent version of the affected product.

#### Reported by

Beckhoff Automation thanks Benedikt Kühne, Siemens Energy for reporting the issue and for support and efforts with the coordinated disclosure. Also Beckhoff Automation thanks CERT@VDE for coordination.
