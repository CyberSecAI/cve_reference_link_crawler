Description

Affected product version
(BEFORE and NOT INCLUDING the named
version)
authelia-bhf package version < 4.37.5

By  default  TwinCAT/BSD  based  products  have  Authelia  installed  and  configured  to  perform  the  user
authentication  for  web  applications  hosted  on  a  target.  This  installation  and  configuration  is  provided  with  the
package named “authelia-bhf”. With the affected versions of the package Authelia is configured to accept user-
controlled input via URL parameter that specifies a link which can then be a link to an arbitrary external site.

Please note: The sources for the package “authelia-bhf” are a fork from the original Open Source Software called
“Authelia”.  The  vulnerability  was  exclusively  introduced  with  that  fork  and  has  been  removed  there.  It  never
became part of “Authelia”.

Mitigation

Use firewall or web-proxy technology at your network perimeter which allow internal clients to access only trusted
external sites directly.

Solution

Please update to a recent version of the affected product.
