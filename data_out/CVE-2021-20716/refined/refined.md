- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hidden functionality (CWE-912) exists within multiple Buffalo network devices that allows an attacker to enable debug options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hidden debug functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A network-adjacent attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or OS commands, change the configuration, and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device.
