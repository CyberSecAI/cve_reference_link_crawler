- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misconfigured web server route allows access to a directory that should not be accessible, allowing the execution of applications within it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect web server route configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote privileged attacker can execute applications within a specific OS directory. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality and availability, but not integrity, as specified in the CVSS vector.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through HTTP invocations over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative credentials to authenticate to the web application and is required to have network access.
