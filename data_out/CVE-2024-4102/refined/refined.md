Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4102

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `ajax()` function of the Pricing Table plugin for WordPress. This function handles AJAX requests for various actions, such as adding, updating, and removing pricing tables. The absence of a capability check allows any authenticated user, including those with minimal "subscriber" level access, to perform these actions, which should be restricted to administrators or other privileged roles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before executing actions in the `ajax()` function. This allows users without the necessary permissions to interact with the plugin in an unintended manner.
* **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin uses AJAX to handle various operations but fails to verify user capabilities before processing requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can add, modify, or remove pricing tables. This could lead to data corruption, defacement of the website, or the insertion of malicious content within the pricing tables.
* **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the immediate impact seems limited to modifying pricing tables, this type of vulnerability could be a stepping stone to other, more significant attacks if other areas of the plugin or site are vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack is conducted via network requests to the WordPress site, specifically AJAX calls.
* **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. However, the required access level is very low (subscriber or higher).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **WordPress Account:**  The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected WordPress site with minimal access privileges (subscriber or higher).
* **Knowledge of AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker must know the correct AJAX endpoint used by the plugin and the specific parameters to send to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Pricing Table plugin up to and including 2.0.1.
* No patch is currently available. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin or apply custom mitigations based on risk tolerance.
* The vulnerable code snippet is in `widgets-api.php` specifically in the `ajax()` function which does not check capabilities before calling the relevant methods
* The provided code highlights methods that can be called through AJAX such as `postAdd`, `postRemove`, `postRestore`, and `postUpdate`, all of which are vulnerable.
