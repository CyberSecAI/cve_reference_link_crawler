The Pricing Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized actions like editing pricing tables.
