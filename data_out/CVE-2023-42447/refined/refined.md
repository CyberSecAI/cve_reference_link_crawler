- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input. Specifically, UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters can trigger the panic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds access due to improper handling of multi-byte UTF-8 characters in blurhash parsing.
    - The parsing code uses panic guards, which suggests the issue could lead to a denial of service.
    - CWE-248: Uncaught Exception, which can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior.
    - CWE-392: Missing Check for a Critical Resource, which implies the resource is not validated before usage, leading to the panic.
    - CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input, indicating that the input parsing does not sufficiently validate input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service due to panics in the blurhash parsing code. This could be triggered by feeding maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted blurhash strings over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send input to the affected software, such as crafted blurhash strings over the network. No user interaction or privileges are required.
