The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36644.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control implementation in the `printmail` plugin of ITB-GmbH TradePro v9.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect access control allowing unauthorized access to order confirmations.
- Lack of proper authentication and authorization checks on the `printmail` plugin endpoint.
- Predictable or easily enumerated `orderid` parameter.
- Dependency on session cookies for user identification which are not sufficiently validated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can access and view all order confirmations from the online shop, potentially exposing sensitive customer and order data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access via HTTP(S) requests.
- Exploitation occurs by sending crafted requests to the `printmail` plugin's endpoint with arbitrary `orderid` values and a valid session cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Ability to obtain a valid session cookie (can be unauthenticated).
- Ability to enumerate or acquire order IDs.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) script demonstrating the vulnerability, which highlights how to exploit the lack of proper access controls by iterating through order IDs to retrieve order information. The vulnerability is also linked to CVE-2023-36645, suggesting a possible SQL injection vulnerability that could further facilitate the discovery of valid order IDs. The PoC script uses `curl` to retrieve session cookies, and then makes requests to the vulnerable endpoint, iterating through order IDs, demonstrating that the endpoint returns order confirmation details.
