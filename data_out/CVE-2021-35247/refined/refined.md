Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-35247

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input on the Serv-U web login screen when using LDAP authentication. This allowed for the inclusion of characters that should have been filtered out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The primary weakness was the lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the login form, specifically when interacting with LDAP authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The direct impact was limited, as the LDAP servers ignored the improper characters. However, this suggests that exploitation could have led to issues if the LDAP server behavior was different. The CVE description indicates the potential for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack through the injection of malicious code into the LDAP server. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation or data compromise if the improper characters were processed by the server.
- Although not explicitly stated, an attacker could potentially use this to cause issues with logging/auditing by injecting malformed data, potentially allowing them to evade detection

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Serv-U web login screen, targeting the field used for LDAP authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the Serv-U web login screen.
- No special privileges are required, as this vulnerability can be exploited by any user with access to the login screen.
- The attacker would need to have knowledge of the vulnerability and ability to craft an input string containing un-sanitized characters.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found by Jonathan Bar Or of Microsoft.
- The fix was implemented in Serv-U version 15.3, which introduced updated input validation and sanitization.
- SolarWinds recommends upgrading to the latest version of Serv-U.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 (Medium).
- The specific CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
- The vulnerability is present in Serv-U versions 15.2.5 and earlier.
