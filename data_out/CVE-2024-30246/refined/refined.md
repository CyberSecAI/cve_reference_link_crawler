Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Tuleap handles the deletion or moving of artifacts. When an artifact is deleted or moved, the system incorrectly removes values from the database associated with *unrelated* artifacts. This issue was introduced by commit `7f2e5e974596196bd96c2146c533353ecbcc592f`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Data Deletion:** The primary weakness is the flawed logic in the artifact deletion/move process, causing the system to delete data from the `tracker_changeset_value` table and its related tables, such as  `tracker_changeset_value_artifactlink`, `tracker_changeset_value_computedfield_manual_value`, `tracker_changeset_value_date`, `tracker_changeset_value_file`, `tracker_changeset_value_float`, `tracker_changeset_value_int`, `tracker_changeset_value_list`, `tracker_changeset_value_openlist`, `tracker_changeset_value_permissionsonartifact`, and `tracker_changeset_value_text`.
- **Orphaned Values:** The deletion process does not properly select the correct elements, leading to the existence of orphaned values in the database.
- **Lack of Referential Integrity:** The system fails to maintain data integrity, as deleting one artifact incorrectly affects data associated with others.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Loss:** A malicious user could intentionally exploit this flaw to delete information from various fields of unrelated artifacts, causing data loss across the Tuleap instance.
- **Affected Fields:** The following field types are impacted:
    - Date
    - File
    - Float
    - Int
    - List (checkbox, selectbox, radio button, multi-selectbox)
    - OpenList
    - Text
    - String
   - Permissions on artifact

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Low Complexity:** Exploitation requires minimal complexity.
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges can exploit this issue.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is needed for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs a valid account with low privileges on the Tuleap instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the deletion or move of an artifact.
- The attacker does not need to have any special skills.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue has been assigned CVE-2024-30246.
- A tool has been provided to help identify and retrieve corrupted data from backups.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Guilhem Bonnefille from CS Group.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L).

The fix for this vulnerability involves changes to the `ArchiveAndDeleteArtifactTaskBuilder.php`,  `PendingArtifactRemovalDao.php` and removal of `ArtifactChangesetValueDeletorDAO.php` along with some adjustments in `ArtifactDependenciesCleaner.php` and `ArtifactDependenciesDeletorTest.php`.
