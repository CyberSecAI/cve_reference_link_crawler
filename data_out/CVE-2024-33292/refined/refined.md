Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of several PHP scripts within the identified web applications. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection**. The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `id` parameter in the following files:
    *   `under_products_marechal.php`
    *   `notre-expertise-details.php`
    *   `injectables-details.php`
    *   `nos-praticiens-detail.php`
    *   `actualites-detail.php`

    This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries being executed against the backend database. The injection can be boolean-based, time-based, or UNION query-based.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
    *   Extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   Potentially modify data within the database.
    *   In some cases, take complete control of the database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts.
    *   The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   For example: `https://www.cmcelqods-dz.com/notre-expertise-details.php?id=...` where `...` contains the injected SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web applications.
    *   No special privileges are required on the server side other than network accessibility.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
    *   Tools like sqlmap can be used to automate the exploitation process.
