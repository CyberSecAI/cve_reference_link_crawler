{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check on the `wpvivid_upload_import_files` and `wpvivid_upload_files` AJAX actions. This allows low-level authenticated users (subscribers and above) to upload arbitrary files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to missing capability check, lack of proper authorization on AJAX actions, allowing users with subscriber privileges to upload zip files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to upload arbitrary zip files. These files can then be extracted, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, database compromise, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, leveraging the vulnerable AJAX actions `wpvivid_upload_import_files` and `wpvivid_upload_files`. An attacker needs to be authenticated as a subscriber or a user with higher privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site to initiate the attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges. No other special privileges or positioning is required."
