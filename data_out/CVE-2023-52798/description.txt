In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix dfs radar event locking

The ath11k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the DFS radar event
handling code calling ath11k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id() was not marked as a
read-side critical section.

Mark the code in question as an RCU read-side critical section to avoid
any potential use-after-free issues.

Compile tested only.
