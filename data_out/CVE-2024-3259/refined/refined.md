Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the `admin/delete_activity.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System 1.0.
*   The root cause is that the application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `activity_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `activity_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker could also modify or delete data, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**  Depending on the structure of the database and the queries executed, it might be possible to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `activity_id` parameter in the web request to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Direct Interaction:** The vulnerability exists within the `admin/delete_activity.php` which indicates it could be reached directly via the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:**  The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to construct effective injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** Although not explicitly stated, the reference to `admin/delete_activity.php` suggests that access to this file is likely to require prior authentication as an admin. However, this is not directly mentioned in the description.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw stemming from the lack of proper input validation. Attackers can leverage this to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other potential security breaches.
