- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FeehiCMS application does not properly verify that a user intentionally submitted a well-formed request within the "Post My Comment Tab" functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which is caused by insufficient verification of request origin.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a compromise of data integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting malicious requests, which rely on user interaction by the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must induce a victim to interact with a malicious request, which may be done by making them visit a malicious webpage or clicking a malicious link.
