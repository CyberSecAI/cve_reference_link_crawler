- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Unyson plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress application, under their current authentication. This could result in unauthorized changes to the website's content, configuration, or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it, typically by embedding the request in a link, image, or script on a website or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator or other privileged user to interact with the malicious request. They do not need to be authenticated themselves to trigger the vulnerability.
