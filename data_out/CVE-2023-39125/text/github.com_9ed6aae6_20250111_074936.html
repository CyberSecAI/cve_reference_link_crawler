| Root Cause    [NTSC-CRT/bmp\_rw.c](https://github.com/LMP88959/NTSC-CRT/blob/e267248280f960d6d55174127abcf4fdf679d742/bmp_rw.c#L35-L55)  Lines 35 to 55 in [e267248](/LMP88959/NTSC-CRT/commit/e267248280f960d6d55174127abcf4fdf679d742)   |  | f = fopen(file, "rb"); | | --- | --- | |  | if (f == NULL) { | |  | return NULL; | |  | } | |  | fread(header, sizeof(unsigned char), 54, f); | |  | width = \*(int\*) &header[18]; | |  | height = \*(int\*) &header[22]; | |  | BPP = \*(int\*) &header[28]; | |  | size = (width \* height \* (BPP / 8)); | |  | padding = ((4 - (width \* (BPP / 8)) % 4) % 4); | |  | data = calloc\_func(size, (BPP / 8)); | |  | if (data == NULL) { | |  | return NULL; | |  | } | |  | fseek(f, 54, SEEK\_SET); | |  | for (Y = height - 1; Y >= 0; Y--) { | |  | for (X = 0; X < width; X++) { | |  | fread(&data[(Y \* width + X) \* (BPP / 8)], (BPP / 8), 1, f); | |  | } | |  | fread(pad, padding, 1, f); | |  | } |      You can check that the file given as an input in the `loadBMP` function is opened and read into memory. Since the value is not verified by reading width, height, and BPP, there is a possibility that the value will be a small value beyond the range of `unsigned int`. In other words, you can allocate a buffer smaller than the size that will be used.  Alternatively, if the result of the size operation on line 43 exceeds the range of `unsigned int`, and integer overflow is likely. Later, on line 45, a heap address of `size *(BPP/8)` is returned via the calloc function. The integer overflow can cause problems if the size is unintentionally small enough.  This causes a problem on line 52. When a file is read into the heap through the `fread` function, the buffer allocated for data overflows.

| Again, thanks for the deep dive but this main application was not intended to be a well tested program, it's just something to demonstrate it works and for the user to see how to integrate it into their own programs. |

Sorry, something went wrong.
