# Stored Cross-Site Scripting allows Privilege Elevation

High

published
GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f
Feb 21, 2024

## Package

actions

querybook
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

< 3.31.1

## Patched versions

3.31.1

## Description

### Impact

There exists a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor, enabling users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution.

The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks an XSS URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker.

### Patches

A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs.

### Workarounds

At present, there exist no workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.

### References

Please refer to the following PR for more details: [#1412](https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1412).

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-26148

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

### @czgu **[czgu](/czgu)** commented [Feb 21, 2024](#issue-2147728424) • edited Loading

Currently, if a user inputs a `javascript:alert()` into the URL, it would XSS inject any users on that doc who clicks the link. This fix is backward compatible where all non-http/https urls will cease to work.

Previous Behavior

1. Create a new DataDoc
2. Create a text cell and enter text "foo"
3. Select the text and assign URL "javascript:alert()"
4. Click on the URL and notice the alert is triggered.

Current Behavior

Step 1-3: same as above

4. When clicking on the URL, a blank page will be opened.

Sorry, something went wrong.
