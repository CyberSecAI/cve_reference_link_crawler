Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-26148:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper URL validation within Querybook's rich text editor. The editor allows users to input arbitrary URLs, including those using the `javascript:` protocol, without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious URLs, including those with `javascript:` protocol, are stored in the DataDocs. When a user clicks on the crafted link, the JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Client-Side Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary client-side JavaScript within the browser of users viewing the affected DataDocs.
*   **Privilege Elevation:** If an administrator clicks a malicious link, the attacker could potentially gain access to the administrator's role and privileges. This could lead to the compromise of admin access.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Rich Text Editor Input:** Attackers input malicious URLs (e.g., `javascript:alert()`) through the rich text editor while creating/editing a DataDoc.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack is triggered when a user clicks the crafted link within the DataDoc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or edit DataDocs to inject the malicious URLs.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Querybook versions prior to 3.31.1.
*   The fix in version 3.31.1 involves sanitizing URLs to allow only `http:` or `https:` protocols, preventing `javascript:` URLs from being executed.
*   The fix is backward compatible and automatically applies to existing DataDocs.
*   There are no known workarounds other than manually checking URLs before clicking.
