{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the sdcid and keyid1 parameters of a GET request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web page, or redirection to malicious sites, among other attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the sdcid and/or keyid1 parameters is sent to a user. When the user clicks the link, the malicious code is executed within their browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick the user into visiting it. This could be achieved via social engineering, embedding the link on a website, or other methods. The attacker does not need prior access to the application."
