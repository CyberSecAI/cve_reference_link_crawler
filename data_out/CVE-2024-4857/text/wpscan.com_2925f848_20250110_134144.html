## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FS Product Inquiry <= 1.1.1 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some form submissions, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Add an inquiry form using the shortcode `[fspi-show-products-list]`
2. As a non-logged in visitor, enter the payload `
" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//` for the name
3. See the XSS when editing an individual inquiry from: https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=fspi-inquiry

### Affects Plugins
