Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in the permission inheritance mechanism within Devolutions Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how permissions are inherited within the Devolutions Server environment. Specifically, a flaw exists that allows a low-privileged user to gain access to entries they should not have access to. This occurs through a specific combination of permissions settings on the entry itself and on its parent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who has compromised a low-privileged user account can gain unauthorized access to entries. This could allow them to view sensitive information or perform actions they are not authorized to perform, based on the compromised account permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). It involves an attacker who has already compromised a low privileged user account within the Devolutions Server environment, or obtained valid user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have compromised a low-privileged user account (PR:L).
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the Devolutions Server through its network interface.
*   The attacker also requires specific conditions in the permission configuration of the entry and its parent.

**CVSS Score:**

*   Medium 6.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**Additional details:**

* The affected product is Devolutions Server 2022.3.13.0 and earlier.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 2023.1 and later.
* The vulnerability requires a "specific combination of permissions in the entry and in its parent".

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.
