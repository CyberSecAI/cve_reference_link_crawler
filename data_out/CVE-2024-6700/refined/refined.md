The provided content is a security advisory from Pega regarding three vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-6700.

**CVE-2024-6700 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability related to the application name.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize input when displaying the application name, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious executable scripts into the application code. This could lead to a variety of attacks, potentially including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, after enticing a user to click a malicious link.
*   **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious code into the application name field, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when another user views the application name. The attack is often initiated by sending a malicious link to a user, enticing them to click it.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have Pega developer access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory also mentions two other vulnerabilities: an XSS issue with case type (CVE-2024-6701) and an HTML injection issue with the stage (CVE-2024-6702).
*   The vulnerabilities are rated as medium severity.
*   The advisory provides remediation steps, including applying hotfixes or upgrading to specific patch releases.
*   The advisory notes that they are not aware of any clients being compromised due to these vulnerabilities.
*   Pega Cloud clients are being proactively remediated by Pega. Other clients must apply the hotfixes themselves.
*   Hotfixes are only provided for the latest Pega Platform patch releases in standard support (23.1.2 and 24.1.1).
