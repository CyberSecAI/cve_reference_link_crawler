Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Kostac PLC Programming Software (Former name: Koyo PLC Programming Software) Version 1.6.14.0 and earlier. Having a user open a specially crafted project file which was saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.9.0 and earlier may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, arbitrary code execution, and/or information disclosure because the issues exist in parsing of KPP project files.
