Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The gRPC ports (7070 and 7071) in TorchServe were not bound to localhost by default. This meant that when TorchServe was launched, these ports were exposed on all network interfaces, making them accessible from outside the local machine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted network access: The gRPC ports were not bound to localhost, making them accessible from any network interface.
- Exposure of gRPC endpoints:  The gRPC endpoints, intended for internal communication, were inadvertently exposed to the network.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential unauthorized access: Attackers could potentially access the exposed gRPC endpoints.
- Confidentiality risk:  Though the specific impact is not fully detailed, the CVSS score indicates a potential for low confidentiality impact. The exposed endpoints might allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information handled by the gRPC services.
- Availability risk: The high availability impact suggests an attacker might be able to disrupt or disable the gRPC services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs to have network access to the machine where TorchServe is running.
- No special privileges: No specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in TorchServe version 0.11.0 by ensuring that the gRPC ports are bound to localhost by default.
- This fix was implemented in pull request #3083
- The default behavior of binding to the wildcard address `*` can be overridden by setting specific addresses (like `0.0.0.0` for Docker environments).
- The issue was responsibly disclosed by Kroll Cyber Risk.

This information aligns with and expands upon the brief description in the CVE, giving more specific details on the root cause, impact, and remediation.
