[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This is the release of TorchServe v0.11.0.

## Highlights Include

* GenAI inference optimizations showcasing
  + `torch.compile` with OpenVINO backend for Stable Diffusion
  + Intel IPEX for Llama
* Experimental support for Apple MPS and linux-aarch64
* Security bug fixing

## GenAI

* Upgraded LLama2 examples to Llama3
  + Supported Llama3 in HuggingFace Accelerate Example [#3108](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3108) [@mreso](https://github.com/mreso)
  + Supported Llama3 in chat bot [#3131](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3131) [@mreso](https://github.com/mreso)
  + Supported Llama3 on inf2 Neuronx transformer using continuous batching or micro batching [#3133](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3133) [#3035](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3035) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)
* Examples for LoRA and Mistral [#3077](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3077) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)
* IPEX LLM serving example with Intel AMX [#3068](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3068) [@bbhattar](https://github.com/bbhattar)
* Integration of Intel Openvino with TorchServe using `torch.compile`. Example showcase of `openvino` `torch.compile` backend with Stable Diffusion [#3116](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3116) [@suryasidd](https://github.com/suryasidd)
* Enabling retrieval of guaranteed sequential order of input sequences with low latency for stateful inference via HTTP extending this previously gRPC-only feature [#3142](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3142) [@lxning](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=lxning)

## Linux aarch64 Support:

TorchServe adds support for linux-aarch64 and shows an example working on AWS Graviton. This provides users with a new platform alternative for serving models on CPU.

* Supported linux aarch64 with examples SpeechT5 [#3071](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3071) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

## Apple Silicon Support:

* TorchServe now includes support MPS backend on apple silicon [#3048](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3048) [@udaij12](https://github.com/udaij12) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)
* Added TorchServe quickstart chatbot example [#3003](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3003) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

## XGBoost Support:

With the XGBoost Classifier example, we show how to deploy any pickled model with TorchServe.

* Added XGBoost Classifier Example [#3088](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3088) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

## Security

The ability to bypass allowed\_urls using relative paths has been fixed by ensuring preemptive check for relative paths prior to copying the model archive to the model store directory. Also, the default gRPC inference and management addresses are now set to localhost(127.0.0.1) to reduce scope of default access to gRPC endpoints.

* Fixed allowed\_urls filter bypass [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082) [@udaij12](https://github.com/udaij12) [@msaroufim](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commits?author=msaroufim)

### @namannandan **[namannandan](/namannandan)** commented [Apr 11, 2024](#issue-2238357373)

## Description

In the current implementation, the configured GRPC port is by default associated with the wildcard address

[serve/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/ModelServer.java](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/ModelServer.java#L450)

|  | NettyServerBuilder.forPort(configManager.getGRPCPort(connectorType)) |
| --- | --- |

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store ./model-store

$ netstat -an | grep 7070
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  *.7070                 *.*                    LISTEN

$ netstat -an | grep 7071
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  *.7071                 *.*                    LISTEN

```

Note that the grpc ports `7070` and `7071` are associated with the wildcard address `*`.

With the fix in this PR, the grpc ports are associated with localhost(`127.0.0.1`) by default.

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store ./model-store

$ netstat -an | grep 7070
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  127.0.0.1.7070                 *.*                    LISTEN

$ netstat -an | grep 7071
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)

```

In case of docker, the grpc address will need to be configured to `0.0.0.0` similar to the http management and inference addresses because otherwise, the grpc endpoint will not be accessible from outside the container:

[serve/docker/config.properties](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114/docker/config.properties#L1-L2)

Lines 1 to 2

[cdba0fd](/pytorch/serve/commit/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114)

|  | inference\_address=http://0.0.0.0:8080 |
| --- | --- |
|  | management\_address=http://0.0.0.0:8081 |

Documentation already includes best practice to bind `localhost` ports to the ports exposed by docker to ensure access only to the host on which the container is running.

should we be more explicit in the if else that the second clause is only for inference?

Added configuration option to set grpc address separately from port to maintain backwards compatibility to retain the grpc port configuration:

It is possible to support configuration format as `grpc_inference_address=http://0.0.0.0:7070` but we've had support to configure the GRPC ports alone since `v0.3.0`:

[serve/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/util/ConfigManager.java](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/89c5389d5dba23c32fbed7e7d58234fc30b690a5/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/util/ConfigManager.java#L104-L105)

Lines 104 to 105
in
[89c5389](/pytorch/serve/commit/89c5389d5dba23c32fbed7e7d58234fc30b690a5)

|  | private static final String TS\_GRPC\_INFERENCE\_PORT = "grpc\_inference\_port"; |
| --- | --- |
|  | private static final String TS\_GRPC\_MANAGEMENT\_PORT = "grpc\_management\_port"; |

To maintain backwards compatibility, I believe we'll need to retain the grpc port configuration.

If we were to allow specifying the port along with the address as `grpc_inference_address=http://0.0.0.0:7070`, I believe we'll have two options:

1. Ignore the grpc port configuration ex `grpc_inference_port` if `grpc_inference_address` includes the port already.
2. Override the port specified in `grpc_inference_address` with the port specified in `grpc_inference_port`.

Another option is to potentially rename `grpc_inference_address` to `grpc_inference_ip_address` to the make the configuration name more explicit to convey what the value is intended to be.

Let me know your thoughts or suggestions on better ways to handle it.

# TorchServe gRPC Port Exposure

High

[namannandan](/namannandan)
published
GHSA-hhpg-v63p-wp7w
Jul 18, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.11.0

## Description

### Impact

The two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/) by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.

### Patches

This issue in TorchServe has been fixed in [#3083](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3083).

TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
