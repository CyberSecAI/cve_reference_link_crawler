### @namannandan **[namannandan](/namannandan)** commented [Apr 11, 2024](#issue-2238357373)

## Description

In the current implementation, the configured GRPC port is by default associated with the wildcard address

[serve/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/ModelServer.java](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/ModelServer.java#L450)

Line 450
in
[cdba0fd](/pytorch/serve/commit/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114)

|  | NettyServerBuilder.forPort(configManager.getGRPCPort(connectorType)) |
| --- | --- |

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store ./model-store

$ netstat -an | grep 7070
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  *.7070                 *.*                    LISTEN

$ netstat -an | grep 7071
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  *.7071                 *.*                    LISTEN

```

Note that the grpc ports `7070` and `7071` are associated with the wildcard address `*`.

With the fix in this PR, the grpc ports are associated with localhost(`127.0.0.1`) by default.

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store ./model-store

$ netstat -an | grep 7070
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  127.0.0.1.7070                 *.*                    LISTEN

$ netstat -an | grep 7071
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp46      0      0  127.0.0.1.7071                 *.*                    LISTEN

```

In case of docker, the grpc address will need to be configured to `0.0.0.0` similar to the http management and inference addresses because otherwise, the grpc endpoint will not be accessible from outside the container:

[serve/docker/config.properties](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114/docker/config.properties#L1-L2)

Lines 1 to 2
in
[cdba0fd](/pytorch/serve/commit/cdba0fd449c2fd23dcf37c54c0784035541d5114)

|  | inference\_address=http://0.0.0.0:8080 |
| --- | --- |
|  | management\_address=http://0.0.0.0:8081 |

Documentation already includes best practice to bind `localhost` ports to the ports exposed by docker to ensure access only to the host on which the container is running.

should we be more explicit in the if else that the second clause is only for inference?

Added configuration option to set grpc address separately from port to maintain backwards compatibility to retain the grpc port configuration:

can we keep this consistent?

It is possible to support configuration format as `grpc_inference_address=http://0.0.0.0:7070` but we've had support to configure the GRPC ports alone since `v0.3.0`:

[serve/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/util/ConfigManager.java](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/89c5389d5dba23c32fbed7e7d58234fc30b690a5/frontend/server/src/main/java/org/pytorch/serve/util/ConfigManager.java#L104-L105)

in
[89c5389](/pytorch/serve/commit/89c5389d5dba23c32fbed7e7d58234fc30b690a5)

|  | private static final String TS\_GRPC\_INFERENCE\_PORT = "grpc\_inference\_port"; |
| --- | --- |
|  | private static final String TS\_GRPC\_MANAGEMENT\_PORT = "grpc\_management\_port"; |

To maintain backwards compatibility, I believe we'll need to retain the grpc port configuration.

If we were to allow specifying the port along with the address as `grpc_inference_address=http://0.0.0.0:7070`, I believe we'll have two options:

1. Ignore the grpc port configuration ex `grpc_inference_port` if `grpc_inference_address` includes the port already.
2. Override the port specified in `grpc_inference_address` with the port specified in `grpc_inference_port`.

Another option is to potentially rename `grpc_inference_address` to `grpc_inference_ip_address` to the make the configuration name more explicit to convey what the value is intended to be.

Let me know your thoughts or suggestions on better ways to handle it.
