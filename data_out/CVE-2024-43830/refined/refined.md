{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `device_remove_groups()` call, which removes sysfs attributes, was being called after the `deactivate()` callback, which frees the trigger-data associated with those attributes. This created a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability where sysfs attribute access functions can operate on freed trigger-data.",
    "attack_vectors": "Accessing the sysfs attributes of an LED trigger after it has been deactivated but before the sysfs attributes are unregistered, which could potentially be done via a crafted program or user interaction.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the sysfs attributes of the led trigger after it has been deactivated."
  },
  "resolution": "The fix moves the `device_remove_groups()` call to before the `deactivate()` call to ensure that sysfs attributes are unregistered before the trigger-data is freed, thus preventing the race condition.",
    "cve": "CVE-2024-43830"
