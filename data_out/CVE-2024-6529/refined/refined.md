- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`layout`) before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially targeting high-privilege users like administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the `layout` parameter with XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that is then visited by the victim. No authentication is required.
