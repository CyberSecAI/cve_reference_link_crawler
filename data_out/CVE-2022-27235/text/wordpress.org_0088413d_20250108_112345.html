This plugin does what the title and description says and it’s very flexible, as well as customisable if you know your CSS.
For years I would look for social share widget plugins to add to my projects and they would all seem to have some problem with them. What I’d imagine would be a basic function would be “Premium” and what I’d consider would be an add-on service would be free. It’s almost like these developers don’t know why somebody would need these buttons or they’re just bad at making plugins.This plugin, however, does everything right, so I’m willing to support it.

I tryed lot’s of social sharing add-ons. Finally this is the one I will work with. The free version does already what I want. And for the minor limitations I will soon upgrade to Pro version. A free version must include what you want and at least working. That is what this plugin do… Good work for the developers.
