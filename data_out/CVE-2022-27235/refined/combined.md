This plugin does what the title and description says and it’s very flexible, as well as customisable if you know your CSS.
For years I would look for social share widget plugins to add to my projects and they would all seem to have some problem with them. What I’d imagine would be a basic function would be “Premium” and what I’d consider would be an add-on service would be free. It’s almost like these developers don’t know why somebody would need these buttons or they’re just bad at making plugins.This plugin, however, does everything right, so I’m willing to support it.

I tryed lot’s of social sharing add-ons. Finally this is the one I will work with. The free version does already what I want. And for the minor limitations I will soon upgrade to Pro version. A free version must include what you want and at least working. That is what this plugin do… Good work for the developers.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
