**Content Summary**

The provided content consists of:

1.  GitHub repository release notes for TryGhost/Ghost
2.  Ghost CMS documentation on reverse proxy configuration
3.  A Google Docs document titled "Ghost CMS - Brute Force Protection Bypass CVE" which is not accessible

**Analysis of Relevant Content**

1.  **GitHub Repository Release Notes:** The GitHub release notes for TryGhost/Ghost provide information on the latest releases. The most recent listed release (5.105.0) includes a fix for file permission issues:
    *   `ðŸ”’ Limited permissions for uploaded files to 0644 (#21841)`
    *   This indicates that previously uploaded files might not have had restrictive permissions, potentially leading to an issue, although not necessarily a bypass.
   
2. **Ghost CMS Documentation on Reverse Proxy Configuration:** This document explains how to configure a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) with Ghost and highlights a common issue:
    *   **Issue:** Infinite redirect loops occur when `x-forwarded-proto` header is not correctly set to 'https' when the proxy handles SSL termination.
    *   **Root Cause:**  Ghost relies on the `x-forwarded-proto` header to determine if the connection is secure. If this header is missing or incorrect, Ghost may redirect to HTTPS causing a loop.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Misconfiguration of the reverse proxy, rather than a vulnerability in Ghost itself.
    *   **Impact:** A denial of service condition where the application gets stuck in a redirect loop.
    *   **Attack Vector:** This is a configuration issue that is not exploitable by an attacker.

3. **Google Docs Document:** The title "Ghost CMS - Brute Force Protection Bypass CVE" is intriguing, but the content is inaccessible. This document title suggests that a brute-force protection bypass vulnerability might exist. This document's contents could be relevant to CVE-2024-34451, however, the document is inaccessible so no further analysis is possible.

**Relevance to CVE-2024-34451**

Based solely on the content:

*   The GitHub release notes provide a potential security fix related to uploaded file permissions but it does not provide enough detail to determine if it is directly related to CVE-2024-34451.
*   The reverse proxy documentation does not describe a Ghost application vulnerability and is therefore unrelated.
*   The Google Docs title suggests a brute-force protection bypass vulnerability which could be related but the document is inaccessible so no further information is available.

**Conclusion**

Due to lack of specific vulnerability information in accessible content, and based on the limited information found, the response is:

**NOINFO**
