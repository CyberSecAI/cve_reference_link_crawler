SSA-524778:
Simulation

File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Tecnomatix Plant

SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered when
the application reads SPP and IGS ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle using the affected
application, this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution on the target host
system.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted SPP or IGS ﬁles from unknown sources

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

Tecnomatix Plant Simulation allows you to model, simulate, explore and optimize logistics systems and
their processes. These models enable analysis of material ﬂow, resource utilization and logistics for all
levels of manufacturing planning from global production facilities to local plants and speciﬁc lines, well in
advance of production execution.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
