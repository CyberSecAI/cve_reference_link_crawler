- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow while parsing specially crafted IGS files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious IGS file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted IGS file using the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system.
