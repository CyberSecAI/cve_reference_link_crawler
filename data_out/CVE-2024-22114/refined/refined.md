- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The System Information Widget in the Global View Dashboard exposes host information to users without the necessary permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper preservation of permissions (CWE-281), allowing unauthorized access to host statistics.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users without specific host permissions can view the number of hosts and other system metrics, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the System Information Widget in the Global View Dashboard through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user account with access to the Zabbix frontend, but without explicit permissions to view host information, is required.
