## FAQ

### Does it work with the theme that I am using?

Our tests indicate that the elements work well with most themes that are well coded and that work with Elementor. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword.

The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full-width page template without sidebars. The elements can still be used in the pages of the default template.

Our plugin works well with popular themes for Elementor like [Hello Elementor](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/), [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/), [Ocean WP](https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/) and [GeneratePress](https://wordpress.org/themes/generatepress/).

### Can I use Livemesh Addons for Elementor without Elementor?

The **[Livemesh Addons for Elementor](https://livemeshelementor.com/)** is an addons plugin for Elementor with 30+ premium quality addons, 60+ Styles, and 100+ demo elements built specifically for Elementor and hence cannot be used without installing/activating Elementor on your site.

### Is Elementor PRO required to be activated for your plugin elements to run?

None of our Elementor widgets (premium or free) require Elementor PRO to be activated on the site. However, in order to make use of custom skin and custom grid feature part of Posts Grid and Posts Carousel, you would need PRO version of Elementor since they rely on Theme Builder Templates features exclusive to Elementor PRO.

### Is your plugin compatible with other Elementor Addons?

Yes of course. We ensure maximum compatibility with other Elementor Addons or Extensions.

### Does Livemesh Addons for Elementor work with Elementor Pro?

Our plugin is tested to ensure that it integrates well with Elementor PRO. In fact, it leverages some of the Elementor PRO functions like the powerful theme templates function in [Elementor Theme Builder](https://elementor.com/features/theme-builder/) in its Posts Grid and Posts Carousel modules to provide infinitely customizable skins.

### Will your plugin affect the performance of my site?

We run tests to ensure the speed of the site is not affected when you activate our Elementor addons. We provide a way for you to deactivate those Elementor modules that you do not require for your site to avoid loading them unnecessarily on the pages built with Elementor page builder.

### How to enable the dark version for any element?

In Elementor page builder, edit the section wrapper for the element representing a row of elements. Navigate to the ‘Advanced’ tab of the ‘Edit Section’ sidebar window. Scroll down to the bottom of this tab to the ‘Advanced’ section and input class ‘lae-dark-bg’ in the ‘CSS Classes’ field to activate the dark version of an element.

### My portfolio does not show any items.

Pls install and activate the [Portfolio Post Type plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-post-type/ "Portfolio Post Type") to enable custom post type Portfolio.

### Can I use Livemesh Addons for Elementor on a wordpress.com site?

Since the plugin is hosted on wordpress.org, it is available on wordpress.com as well. However, you may need to opt for a business plan to install/activate third-party plugins on wordpress.com.

### We have a query not addressed here, how can we contact you?

I’m happy with it, does a great job if you are just beginning. I tried Elementor simple, pro and also Divi, but I couldn’t make one page in one week with any of them. With this, I did one page in under 40 minutes, I’m happy with it.

I have the “premium” version of this plugin which uses Freemius – the worst license provider possible, and my Livemesh license keeps getting knocked off from client sites for no reason, meaning the elements stopped working completely. Not once have they responded to my queries about this. I guess since they already have my money, support doesn’t exist.
Don’t trust their customer support.

### Description

The Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Posts Grid widget in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'grid\_skin'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
