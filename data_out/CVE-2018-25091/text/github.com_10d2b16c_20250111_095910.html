| [#1346](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/pull/1346) fixes only "Authorization" header. "authorization" header isn't supported.  RFC7230 section 3.2 "Header Fields" (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2>) says the following.  Each header field consists of a case-insensitive field name followed by a colon (":"), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and optional trailing whitespace. |
