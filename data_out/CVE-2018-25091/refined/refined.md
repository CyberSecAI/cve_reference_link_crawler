Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause was that the `urllib3` library was forwarding the `Authorization` header, regardless of its case (`Authorization` or `authorization`), during cross-site redirects. This behavior is insecure because the `Authorization` header often contains sensitive information (like API keys or tokens). Leaking this header to a different domain could lead to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Insecure Header Forwarding:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure forwarding of the `Authorization` header during cross-site redirects.
-   **Case-Insensitive Header Handling:** The initial fix only addressed the exact "Authorization" header and did not account for the case-insensitive nature of HTTP headers which allowed "authorization" to be forwarded. This was corrected in the final patch.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Credential Leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by intercepting the leaked `Authorization` header.
-   **Unauthorized Access:** This leaked information could then be used to gain unauthorized access to resources or accounts on the original domain.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Cross-Site Redirect:** The attack vector involves a server redirecting a request to a different domain, which is under the control of the attacker.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** While not explicitly mentioned, a MITM attack could also potentially intercept the `Authorization` header if it's leaked during the redirect.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Control over a Redirect Destination:** The attacker must be able to control the destination of a cross-site redirect to be able to intercept the leaked Authorization header. This could be a server under the attacker's control or a compromised server.
-   **Initiate a Redirect:** The attacker must be able to trigger the initial request that would result in the vulnerable cross-site redirect.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented was to remove the `Authorization` header, regardless of its casing, before following any cross-site redirect.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.24.2 of the library, and the fix included changes to the `Retry` class in `src/urllib3/util/retry.py` and `poolmanager.py`.
*   The pull request #1511 addresses the core issue and ensures the removal of the authorization header regardless of casing.
