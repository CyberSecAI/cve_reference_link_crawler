```
A wrong role assigned to PluginManager LIST permission as
introduced in 1.8.0 causes a privilege escalation,
allowing read-only and user group the same rights as
the MANAGE permission:

- enabling/disabling plugins
- uninstalling plugins
- listing installed plugins incl. their details
- retrieving plugin notices
- deleting orphaned plugin settings
```
