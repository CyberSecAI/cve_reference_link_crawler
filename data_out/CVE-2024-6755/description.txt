The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ‘wpw_auto_poster_quick_delete_multiple’ function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts.
