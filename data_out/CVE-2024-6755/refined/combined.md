### Description

The Social Auto Poster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the ‘wpw\_auto\_poster\_quick\_delete\_multiple’ function in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.14. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts.

Sharing posts with Social Auto Poster is quite simple; once configured, all you need to do is make a WordPress post, and the plugin will handle the rest.

### SCHEDULE POSTS

When you have readers from all over the world and want to reach out to a certain country audience, you must always publish something during their time zone. **>Google Analytics,** which is also integrated in this automation tool, so that it can provide information about their internet presence. You can schedule a post to be published based on their online presence, and you will receive a high engagement and click through rate during this period, and this schedule a post module will help to improve engagement ratio in that way.

Here in this case you can use the Social Media Auto Poster – Quick Share module. Simply put, it is the finest strategy to improve your site’s social media presence.

### ALL CUSTOM POST TYPES SUPPORTED

Custom post types transform a WordPress site from a blogging platform to a robust Content Management System (CMS). Because Social Auto Poster supports all custom posts, you will be able to share all custom post types on social media networks by running the Social Auto Poster scheduling plugin.

### CATEGORY AND TAG WISE POSTING

You may wish to publish a post of particular categories or tags to social media accounts. In such cases, it is usually difficult to pick a posting account manually for each post, and you believe you should have some type of method to accomplish this in a matter of seconds. Yes, Social Auto Poster is the only social media WordPress plugin that allows you to choose a posting account for each social media network from the add and edit category/tag page.

For e.g., We have different categories for selling food for dogs and cats. So therefore we have a page for dog food and cat food on facebook, and so we share our product on those pages. It is obvious that we should post the dog food category on the dog food page and cat food category on the cat food page. With the help of category wise posting you can select the category wise posting this plugin takes the load off your shoulder of posting manually in every page. By selecting the category you will be able to share your post respectively.

### INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE CATEGORY AND TAG

It is always difficult to identify and remove posts from the auto scheduled list and reposter that you do not want to publish automatically on social media. Similarly, if you have a bunch of posts that only need to be scheduled, auto posted OR repost, it is difficult to schedule one by one post. The social Auto Poster plugin has the ability to include or exclude categories and tags when determining whether to share or not via scheduler and reposter.

### URL SHORTENER

We’ve all heard of URL shorteners. The post URLs will always be long and distracting that we always think to make short, as the URL you are publishing on social networks should be pleasant otherwise you may startle your followers. The social auto poster supports TinyURL, Bitly URL, and ShorteSt URL, as well as the possibility to maintain the Perfect permalink URL to be posted.

Twitter only allows 280 characters, so if your URL is too long it’ll also be counted in those characters and you won’t be able to describe your message so with the help of URL shortener you can shorten the length of your URL and convey your message without any trouble.

### CONFIGURE UNLIMITED ACCOUNTS

Does this sound good? Yes, Social Auto Poster has a large capacity to handle an unlimited number of accounts for each Social media site. Configure as many as possible. There is no such thing as a limit…!!

Tracking will assist you in monitoring and identifying the best time to post for increased interaction, engagement and clicks on each social network.

### POSTING LOGS

A log is required to document each success and failure. The Social Auto Poster plugin provides a page where all of your posting logs are displayed, with post title and link, posting execution time, and post preview with social network post link, allowing you to simply check the published post from the logs. Posting reports also generates a pie chart depending on the social networks chosen, which can be adjusted by **year, month, and days,** as well as a custom period.

### DEBUG LOG

DEBUG LOG helps you to find the cause of post failure. The debug logs of the Social Auto Poster are quite simple to comprehend. For example, if your post is not being published on any social network, you can easily browse to the debug logs and find a very thorough log for each post, complete with post ID and social network posting account. If it fails, you will always find a reason why your publication failed and then you can configure it accordingly and post it again.

### CUSTOM MESSAGE & TAG SUPPORTS

Sometimes you don’t want to publish the complete piece but only the punch line, title, or some of the material. The social auto poster plugin includes a function that lets you add a custom message to each post and post type. This option is also available in the global settings and applies to all posts. Additionally, this has a few built-in tag supports that allow you to customise the custom message text.
The most interesting part is you can create your own tags to display custom field values. i.e using **{CF-PRDPRICE}** you can display the WooCommerce product prices.

### BULK SCHEDULING & UNSCHEDULING

Tired of manually scheduling posts? The importance of bulk scheduling is simply to save time and ignore the annoying and lengthy process. You can navigate to the managed schedule page in the social media scheduler, choose the posts you want to plan, and use the bulk scheduling option. There is one additional feature that only the Social Auto Poster plugin offers: **bulk unscheduled posting.** Maybe there are some posts that you do not want to publish, but they are already scheduled. Simply select those posts and use the bulk action to unschedule them. On this page, you may find various fascinating filters that can help you identify a large number of posts, filtering by post type, category, status, and date range.

### HASHTAGS

Hashtags are trending on social media platforms right now; they are an upgraded version of the search feature. On social media networks, you can search for relevant material by using hashtags. Similarly, in WordPress, categories and tags are a way to bunch the post. You will be able to compose a custom message in the social auto poster & scheduler plugin, and you can simply add **{hashtags}** and **{hashcats}** tags so that all of your selected **tags** and **categories** will be published as hashtags on the post that you are publishing with social media auto poster & scheduler.

### EMOJI SUPPORT

Emoji is the best way to show your emotions, you are humanizing your brand with this. When you use Emoji in your post title on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms, your message will gain attention. All emoji that you wish to auto-publish on social media are supported by the social auto poster. Simply include emoji in your personalised message, and our WordPress plugin will manage everything.

### REPOSTER

Your popular old posts are not able to get much reach? Revive your old post with a Social Auto Poster reposter functionality. Reposter will assist you in keeping your postings and content in front of your target audience. Revive your old posts by specifying the minimum and maximum post ages (older than X days and younger than Y days) and drive traffic from your favourite social media networks. The reposter module will breathe new life into your old and evergreen content and pump new life into your WordPress website. Reposter also has the ability to publish only unique posts that have never been published by a social auto poster plugin, as well as to wait till a new post is posted or to loop a collection of posts for a specified or indefinite amount of time. It works for any format: post, page, custom post type, and even eCommerce products.

### EXCLUDE POSTING DAYS

Do you want to use the auto poster or reposter only on certain days? You can easily exclude days from the scheduler and reposter on which you do not want to auto publish. The Social Auto Poster is the only WordPress Plugin that allows you to exclude posting days, allowing you to auto post on days when you have higher engagement and your efforts will be rewarded for creating content.

### STRENGTH TO AVOID ACCOUNT BLOCKING

The most typical issue when utilising an automation tool, is that accounts are being blocked. The only tool that addresses this issue is the Social Auto Poster, which has unique URLs for Twitter, a permalink structure to enable pretty permalinks, the publishing intervals should be 30 minutes per post, and we also recommend that you should schedule maximum five number of posts per schedule, among other features. These are the parameters that will help you a lot in preventing your account from being blocked on Social Media Platforms.

### ONLY WHITE LABEL POSTING

This plugin’s main goal is to allow you to promote yourself solely. The plugin posts on your own social media accounts that you have configured. There are no messages such as “Shared by Social Auto Poster” or “Posted by Social Auto Poster for WordPress.”

### MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT

Social Auto Poster is completely translatable both in front and back-end. Because you all are well aware of the fact that all the plugins available in the market have an English interface. And not all the countries out there speak English, therefore they need to translate a plugin in their language first. But don’t worry at all because Social Auto Poster makes sure that you can translate it to any language. There are multiple third party plugins that are beneficial in translating the plugins. WPML is the most popular plugin. This plugin also produces excellent results and it is supported by Social Auto Poster.
