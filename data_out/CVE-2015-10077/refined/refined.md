Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Convert::raw2xml()` to sanitize user-provided input before using it in database queries. The `raw2xml()` function is designed for sanitizing data for XML output and is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
SQL Injection: The code uses `Convert::raw2xml()` instead of `Convert::raw2sql()` to sanitize data before use in SQL queries, this makes SQL injection attacks possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:

*   Read sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify data in the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `auth` parameter in the `preview` function and the `content_id` in `getPreview` function within KapostService.php. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through these parameters and bypass the inadequate sanitization provided by `Convert::raw2xml()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application where `KapostService.php` is in use. No authentication is explicitly required from the given context, suggesting the endpoints might be publicly accessible. The attacker needs to be able to craft requests with malicious SQL code in the `auth` or `content_id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content shows the fix to the vulnerability, replacing `Convert::raw2xml()` with `Convert::raw2sql()` in multiple locations within the `KapostService.php` file. This change correctly sanitizes the user input for SQL queries, mitigating the SQL injection vulnerability.
