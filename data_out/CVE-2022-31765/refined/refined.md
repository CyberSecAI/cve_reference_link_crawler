- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected products do not properly authorize the change password function of the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization (CWE-862).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Low-privileged users can escalate their privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the web interface of the device.

The document provides a detailed list of affected products and their respective vulnerable versions. It also provides mitigation and workaround recommendations to reduce the risk, like using ACLs to restrict access to the webserver and restricting access to the webserver ports to trusted networks.
