# Issuer not verified from obtained token in user\_oidc

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-xx3h-v363-q36j
Aug 10, 2023

## Package

user\_oidc
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.3.3

## Description

### Impact

Missing verification of the issuer would have allowed an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack returning corrupted or known token they also have access to.

### Patches

It is recommended that the user\_oidc app is upgraded to 1.3.3.

### Workarounds

No workaround available

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
