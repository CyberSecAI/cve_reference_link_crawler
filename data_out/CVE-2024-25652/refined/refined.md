- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control, allowing users with reporting access to access other users' remote sessions.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthorized access to remote sessions, potentially leading to data breaches, system manipulation, and complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**  Network-based, requiring a malicious user to have access to the Report functionality within the Delinea PAM Secret Server.
