Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-3979:

**CVE-2022-3979: Type Juggling Vulnerability in Cookie Hash Processing**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from PHP's loose type comparison using `!=` instead of the strict comparison `!==` when validating the cookie hash in the `CoreLogonMultisite.php` file of NagVis. PHP evaluates `!=` loosely on type, leading to potential issues like `"0000"` == `"0e5678"` evaluating to true, which is incorrect.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**
    *   **Type Juggling:** The use of loose comparison (`!=`) in PHP allows for type juggling, where a string like `"0000"` can be interpreted as a number and compared to a string starting with `"0e"` followed by numbers (scientific notation), resulting in an incorrect match.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Due to this vulnerability an attacker can potentially forge a valid cookie by sending a zeroed cookie hash and only needing a collision with a calculated hash beginning with `0e` followed by numbers.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the NagVis authentication and gain access to the NagVis component of Checkmk.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted cookie with a forged hash.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server with manipulated cookies.
    *   No prior authentication is required to exploit this specific vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub commit diff shows the fix which replaces `!=` with `!==` in `CoreLogonMultisite.php`, resolving the type juggling vulnerability.
*   The SonarSource blog post provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including how an attacker can leverage it and chain it with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
*   The blog post also details how a related vulnerability can be used to delete the `auth.secret` file and then, with timing, force Nagvis to read an empty `auth.secret` file to allow an authentication bypass. This is possible because the file creation in the Checkmk GUI and the file reading in Nagvis are separate operations, allowing the attacker to exploit a time-of-check to time-of-use issue.
*   The Checkmk werk entry confirms that NagVis was updated to 1.9.34 to address this and other security issues.

This vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS score of 3.7.
