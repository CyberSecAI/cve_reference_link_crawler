Fix type juggling vulnerability

```
PHP evaluates `!=` a bit loose on the type. So "0000" == "0e5678" is
true in PHP. An attacker could send a zeroed cookie_hash `"0"*32` and
only need an collision with a calculated hash beginning with `0e`
followed by only numbers.

In our tests (with auth.secret set to `stable`) a valid cookie is
`cmkadmin:58191275:00000000000000000000000000000000`.

For a remote attacker this would have needed 58,191,275 guesses.
