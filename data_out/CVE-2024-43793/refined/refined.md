- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Halo editor allows the use of `javascript:` URLs in hyperlinks, which results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**:  Inserting a hyperlink with a `javascript:` URL into the editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to insert content into the editor, which implies having low privileges on the system. The attack can be initiated over the network.
