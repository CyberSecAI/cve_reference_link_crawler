In certain scenarios, Drupal's JSON:API module will output error backtraces. With some configurations, this may cause sensitive information to be cached and made available to anonymous users, leading to privilege escalation.

This vulnerability only affects sites with the JSON:API module enabled, and can be mitigated by uninstalling JSON:API.

The core REST and contributed GraphQL modules are not affected.
