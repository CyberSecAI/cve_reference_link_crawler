- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way Foxit Reader handles certain events of form elements using JavaScript. Specifically, a callback function assigned to the `OnBlur` action of a form field can trigger the `deletePages` function, which prematurely frees objects associated with pages. Subsequent attempts to use these freed objects lead to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416) in the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. The vulnerability occurs due to improper memory management when handling `OnBlur` events of form fields.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. By controlling the freed memory, an attacker can manipulate memory layout, leading to memory corruption and ultimately gaining control of the program's execution flow.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Opening a specially crafted malicious PDF document.
    - Visiting a specially crafted malicious website if the browser plugin extension for Foxit Reader is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious website, which means user interaction is required.
