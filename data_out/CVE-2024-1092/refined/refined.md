**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Authentication:** Requires a user with contributor access or higher.
- **Specific Plugin Feature:** The vulnerability exists within the feedzy dashboard section of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress site with at least contributor level permissions.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Muhammad Daffa.
- The fix is included in plugin version 4.4.2, where appropriate capability checks were added for accessing and modifying feed categories.
- The provided diffs show the code changes made to address the vulnerability, including adding capability checks when registering the "feedzy_categories" post type.
- The changes include adding the `map_meta_cap` argument set to true and including capabilities such as `publish_posts`, `edit_posts`, `edit_others_posts`, `delete_posts`, `delete_others_posts` and `read_private_posts`
