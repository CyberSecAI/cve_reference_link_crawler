Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the web server's failure to properly handle carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF or \r\n, encoded as %0d%0a in URLs) within the `kickidler_authentication_token` GET parameter. This allows for HTTP Response Splitting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The web server doesn't sanitize or validate the input in the `kickidler_authentication_token` parameter, allowing injection of CRLF characters.
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** By injecting CRLF characters, an attacker can manipulate the HTTP response headers, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary impact is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirecting to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted URL:** The attack is initiated by crafting a URL containing the `kickidler_authentication_token` parameter with injected CRLF characters and malicious JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on the malicious link for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the target system
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must have the ability to create and distribute malicious URLs
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user into clicking the specially crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code in the README.md shows the injection of `test%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E` into the `kickidler_authentication_token` parameter. This demonstrates the injection of CRLF characters followed by a simple JavaScript `alert()` for demonstration purposes.
- The vulnerability is present in Kickidler Server versions before 1.107.0.
- The provided content gives a clear explanation and demonstration of the reflected XSS vulnerability, with a more detailed impact than the official CVE description.
