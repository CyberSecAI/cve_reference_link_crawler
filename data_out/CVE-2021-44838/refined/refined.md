{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper access control validation on the `/risque/risque/ajax-details` endpoint, allowing users to access risk details of other companies by manipulating the `id` parameter in a POST request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Controls",
    "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can access sensitive risk information belonging to other companies within the DeltaRM platform.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious authenticated user sends a POST request to `/risque/risque/ajax-details` with a modified `id` parameter to access risk data from other companies.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user of the DeltaRM platform."
