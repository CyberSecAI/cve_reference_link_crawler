Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2016-3536:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly mentions CVE-2016-3536 within the context of a security advisory related to the July 2016 Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU). It specifically states, "This CVE has two additional vulnerabilities relating to Cross Site Scripting and were grouped in one CVE because they affect the same component: Oracle Marketing."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause of the vulnerability is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Specifically, the vulnerability exists because of:
        - A received parameter without validation or sanitization.
        - This unsanitized parameter being used to do something within the program.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The specific weakness is **lack of input validation or sanitization** in the Oracle Marketing component. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker could exploit this XSS vulnerability to:
       - Get the user's session cookies.
       - Send emails using the user's session.
       - Display malicious messages to the user.
       - Potentially gain unauthorized access by using stolen session cookies.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **network-based**. An attacker can craft a malicious link containing a script, and send it to a victim. If the user clicks on the malicious link while logged into the affected Oracle application, the attacker's script will execute in the victim's browser.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with malicious Javascript.
   - The attacker has to get the user to click on the crafted URL, possibly via phishing or other social engineering tactics.
   - The attacker doesn't need to be an authenticated user of the application.

**Additional Details:**

-   The provided content also includes a general explanation of how XSS vulnerabilities work, and mitigation strategies like applying Oracle patches and implementing controls to detect XSS patterns.
-   The vulnerability is part of a larger batch of vulnerabilities addressed in the July 2016 CPU.
-  The Onapsis Research Labs reported this vulnerability.
