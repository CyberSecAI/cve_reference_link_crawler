- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When other users (including admins) view the affected settings page, this malicious code will execute in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, including the malicious XSS payload in parameters such as `title` and `btnLabel`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative or higher privileges to access and modify the plugin settings page and inject the malicious script.
