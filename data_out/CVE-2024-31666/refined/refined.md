Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the content, which appears to correspond to CVE-2024-31666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control on the `/cover/addons/jd_simple_zer/action/edit_addon_post.php` URL in Flusity-CMS v2.33.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** The vulnerability allows an ordinary user (not an administrator) to access and execute the `edit_addon_post.php` script, which is intended for administrative users only.
- **Insufficient Privilege Check:**  The application fails to perform adequate checks to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to access the specified script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An ordinary user, by exploiting this vulnerability, gains the ability to perform actions intended for administrator users. This is a clear privilege escalation.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** The script `edit_addon_post.php` likely provides the ability to modify content within the CMS. This could allow an attacker to alter website content or other data within the CMS.
- **Compromise of CMS Functionality:**  The unauthorized access could potentially lead to further vulnerabilities if the attacker uses the script maliciously, leading to a complete compromise of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable URL `/cover/addons/jd_simple_zer/action/edit_addon_post.php` with an ordinary user's login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ordinary User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with ordinary privileges on the vulnerable Flusity-CMS instance.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable URL:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL path `/cover/addons/jd_simple_zer/action/edit_addon_post.php` to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides a detailed demonstration of the vulnerability by showing how a user with ordinary privileges can access the admin-level function.
- The content includes screenshots of the exploitation process.

In summary, this is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a normal user to access an administrator function due to missing authorization checks.
