The provided content describes a fix for a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `am65-cpsw-nuss.c` driver, specifically related to XDP (eXpress Data Path) transmission.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises when the number of transmit (TX) queues is set to 1 using `ethtool -L eth0 tx 1`. In the `am65_cpsw_ndo_xdp_xmit` function, the code was incorrectly calculating the TX channel index using the maximum number of TX queues (`AM65_CPSW_MAX_TX_QUEUES`) instead of the actual number of available TX queues (`common->tx_ch_num`). When only one TX queue is configured, the modulo operation `cpu % AM65_CPSW_MAX_TX_QUEUES` would still cycle through indices up to `AM65_CPSW_MAX_TX_QUEUES`, leading to accessing an out-of-bounds or null pointer when dereferencing `tx_chns` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect TX queue selection:** The driver used `AM65_CPSW_MAX_TX_QUEUES` instead of `common->tx_ch_num` to select a TX channel for XDP transmission. This resulted in out-of-bounds access.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When the number of TX queues was set to 1, accessing the TX channel using the incorrect calculation resulted in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The NULL pointer dereference causes a kernel panic, leading to system unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the number of TX queues is set to 1 using `ethtool -L eth0 tx 1`, and XDP is used for transmission.
- A local user with the ability to configure the network interface using `ethtool` and trigger XDP transmission can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have root or administrative privileges to use `ethtool` and configure network interfaces.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger XDP transmission (e.g., using `xdp-trafficgen` or similar tools).
- The attacker needs to be on a system that uses the affected `am65-cpsw-nuss.c` driver, typically on Texas Instruments AM65x platforms.

**Fix:**
The fix replaces `AM65_CPSW_MAX_TX_QUEUES` with the actual number of TX channels `common->tx_ch_num` when picking the TX channel in `am65_cpsw_ndo_xdp_xmit()`.
