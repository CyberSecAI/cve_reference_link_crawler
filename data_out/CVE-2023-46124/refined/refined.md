Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of hostnames extracted from URLs used in custom integration uploads. Specifically, the application did not properly block connections to internal resources including `localhost`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The application is vulnerable to SSRF attacks due to the lack of proper validation on hostnames, allowing attackers to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not sufficiently validate the hostnames present in the configuration files of uploaded custom integrations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Requests:** Attackers could send requests to internal systems that should not be publicly accessible
- **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers could potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted YAML files:** Attackers can upload a malicious ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format.
- **Custom Integration Upload:** The vulnerability is exploited via the custom integration upload feature of the Fides web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication and Authorization:** The attacker must be an authenticated API client with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope.  In the Fides Admin UI, this is restricted to highly privileged users such as root users or users with the owner role.
- **Knowledge of YAML structure:** The attacker needs to craft malicious YAML files with the aim of forcing the application to make unintended requests.
