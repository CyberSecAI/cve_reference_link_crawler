Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing and incorrect bound checks within the `libasm` library of elfutils when processing ELF files. Specifically, there are issues within the `i386_disasm` function related to handling instruction prefixes, modrm bytes, and instruction parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing Bounds Check:** There's a missing bounds check in the `FCT_sel` function within `libcpu/i386_data.h` that could lead to reading beyond allocated memory.
2.  **Off-by-One Bounds Check:** An off-by-one error exists in the `FCT_sel` function within `libcpu/i386_data.h`, which also contributes to out-of-bounds access.
3.  **Reachable Asserts:** Assertions in the code (like within the `i386_disasm` function in `libcpu/i386_disasm.c`) that are reachable through crafted input can cause the application to crash. In one case, an assertion was replaced with an explicit error handling to avoid crashing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing specially crafted ELF files to elfutils tools (like `eu-objdump`), an attacker can trigger crashes in the application. This crash leads to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted ELF Files:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating malicious ELF files.
*   **Processing of Malicious ELF Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when an application that uses elfutils (e.g. `eu-objdump`) attempts to process the malicious ELF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted ELF file to a vulnerable elfutils application. The attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability if they can make the vulnerable application parse a malicious ELF file, e.g. by providing the file as an argument to `eu-objdump`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided bug report includes a patch that addresses these issues by adding the missing bounds check and correcting the off-by-one error.
*   The bug report also includes a commit log which replaces the assertions with error messages in some cases to prevent crashes.
*   The original report also includes POCs and error messages, and indicates that AddressSanitizer (ASAN) was used to detect the crashes.

In summary, CVE-2020-21047 involves multiple vulnerabilities due to missing and incorrect bounds checks in `libasm` which could result in a denial of service if malicious ELF files are processed.
