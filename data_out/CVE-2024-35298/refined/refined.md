- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "ZOZOTOWN" App for Android does not properly restrict access to URLs requested via custom URL schemes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoint ([CWE-939](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/939.html))
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can craft a malicious custom URL scheme that, when opened by the vulnerable app, redirects the user to a website of the attacker's choosing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to open the malicious URL using the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through social engineering or other methods of distributing the malicious URL.
