- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permissions on the `WacomInstallI.txt` file, which is handled by the `PrefUtil.exe` utility.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission assignment leading to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required; the attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They then exploit the incorrect permissions on the `WacomInstallI.txt` file.
