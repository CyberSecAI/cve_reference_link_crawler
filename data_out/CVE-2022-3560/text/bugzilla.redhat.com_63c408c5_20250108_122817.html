The pesign package provides a systemd service used to start the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to grant access privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the script doesn't check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker to gain access to privileged files and directories via a path traversal attack. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2023-04-18 22:05:02 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |
