    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2022-3560",
      "root_cause": "The pesign systemd service uses a script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to grant access privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the script does not check for symbolic links.",

        "Path Traversal vulnerability",
        "Improper handling of symbolic links"

         "Local privilege escalation via path traversal through symbolic links"
