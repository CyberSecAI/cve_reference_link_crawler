- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Brocade SANnav application, prior to version 2.2.0, uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for storing passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of the Blowfish algorithm for password storage allows an attacker to decrypt stored account passwords. This indicates a weakness in the password encryption mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can decrypt stored account passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the attacker to have local access to the system where the Brocade SANnav application is installed. The attack is complex (AC:H) and requires a low level of privileges (PR:L). There is a change of scope (S:C) and high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have low-level access to the system where Brocade SANnav is installed.
