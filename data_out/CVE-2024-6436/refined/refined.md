{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Input validation vulnerability",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software does not properly validate input, allowing a malicious user to send malformed packets.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the device unresponsive and requiring a manual restart. It also results in a loss of view for downstream equipment sequences in the controller, preventing users from monitoring or controlling them, although the sequences continue to execute uninterrupted.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending malformed packets to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the server. No specific privileges or user interaction are required."
