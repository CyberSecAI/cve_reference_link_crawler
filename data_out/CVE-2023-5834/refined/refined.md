- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vagrant Windows installer used a custom, non-protected installation path that could be targeted using directory junctions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a non-protected path for installation, allowing an attacker to create a directory junction to redirect file writes to an arbitrary location. This leads to unauthorized file system writes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is system-dependent, but it could lead to privilege escalation in some cases.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves creating a directory junction at the location where the Vagrant installer writes files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to create directory junctions in the system, prior to the Vagrant installation.
