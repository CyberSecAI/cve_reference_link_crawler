# Cross-Site-Scripting during account creation

Moderate

[ThiefMaster](/ThiefMaster)
published
GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff
Sep 4, 2024

## Package

pip

indico
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.3.4

## Patched versions

3.3.4

## Description

### Impact

There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation when redirecting after the account has been successfully created.

Exploitation requires the user to initiate the account creation process with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalize the signup process. Because of this, it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users so the benefits of exploiting it are very limited.

### Patches

You should to update to [Indico 3.3.4](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.4) as soon as possible.

See [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.

### Workarounds

* If you build the Indico package yourself and cannot upgrade for some reason, you can simply update the `flask-multipass` dependency to `>=0.5.5` which fixes the vulnerability. You would do that by editing `requirements.txt` before building the package (see commit [7dcb573](https://github.com/indico/indico/commit/7dcb573837b9fd09d95f74d1baeae225b164cc8f)), or possibly cherry-picking that particular commit.
* Otherwise you could configure your web server to disallow requests containing a query string with a parameter that starts with `javascript:`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# ⚠️ Security fixes

* Fix an XSS vulnerability during account creation. Exploitation requires initiating account creation with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process, so it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. We consider this vulnerability to be of "medium" severity since the ability to abuse this is somewhat limited, but you should update as soon as possible nonetheless ([GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff "GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff"))
