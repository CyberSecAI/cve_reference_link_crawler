# ‚ö†Ô∏è Security fixes

* Fix an XSS vulnerability during account creation. Exploitation requires initiating account creation with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process, so it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. We consider this vulnerability to be of "medium" severity since the ability to abuse this is somewhat limited, but you should update as soon as possible nonetheless ([GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff "GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff"))
