- **Root cause of vulnerability**: System command injection vulnerability within the FortiAP CLI admin console, specifically through the `ifconfig` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability. The lack of proper input sanitization in the `ifconfig` command allows for the injection of arbitrary system-level commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands on the system. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as gaining complete control over the device or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the FortiAP CLI admin console, where specially crafted `ifconfig` commands can be used to inject malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authorized administrator with access to the FortiAP CLI.
