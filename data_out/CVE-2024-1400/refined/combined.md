### Description

The Mollie Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post or page duplication due to a missing capability check on the duplicateForm function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to duplicate arbitrary posts and pages.
