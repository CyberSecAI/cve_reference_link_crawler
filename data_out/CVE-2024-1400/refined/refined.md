Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1400:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `duplicateForm` function of the Mollie Forms plugin. Specifically, there's no verification to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to duplicate a post or page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the `edit_post` capability before allowing them to duplicate a post.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Post Duplication:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level or higher access can duplicate any post or page on the WordPress site, potentially leading to content manipulation, spam, or other forms of abuse.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `duplicateForm` function of the Mollie Forms plugin. The attack vector is through the WordPress admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs at least subscriber-level permissions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Mollie Forms plugin versions up to and including 2.6.3.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.4, which added the necessary capability check with `current_user_can('edit_post', $postId)`.
*   The specific code change is in `mollie-forms/trunk/classes/Admin.php`, where the capability check was added before the CSV download and post title retrieval actions.
* The `duplicateForm` function is not explicitly named in the provided content but is inferred based on the description of the vulnerability as well as the fix.
