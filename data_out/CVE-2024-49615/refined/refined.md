- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress SafetyForms plugin version 1.0.0 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to a malicious actor forcing higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact will depend on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into sending it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
