Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-45688:

**CVE-2023-45688: Information Disclosure via Path Traversal on FTP**

*   **Root Cause:** The FTP service's `SIZE` command does not properly sanitize path traversal characters (`../`).
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation on file paths provided to the `SIZE` command.
*  **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can use the `SIZE` command to determine the size of any file on the file system accessible to the user. This leaks file size information and can be used as a reconnaissance step by an attacker. For instance, an attacker can probe the existence and size of sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow` or `/etc/hostname`.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a crafted `SIZE` command via the FTP protocol to the vulnerable server with a file path containing path traversal sequences like `../`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a valid user account on the Titan MFT or Titan SFTP server with FTP access.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP service on the target server.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Titan MFT and Titan SFTP versions 2.0.16.2277 and 2.0.17.2298, and earlier versions.
    *   Only affects the Linux version of Titan MFT and Titan SFTP.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows a low-privileged user to enumerate the existence and size of arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the lack of path sanitization in the FTP `SIZE` command. It is an information disclosure vulnerability that, while not immediately granting remote code execution, can aid in a more comprehensive attack by providing knowledge of the target system.
