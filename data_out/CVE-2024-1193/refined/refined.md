- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Navicat application crashes due to a buffer overflow vulnerability when handling an excessively long password string in the SSH connection settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the password field within the SSH connection settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the Navicat application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a long string (5005 'A' characters) and pastes it into the password field within the SSH connection settings, triggering the overflow upon connection attempt.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Navicat application interface and have the ability to manipulate the connection settings, specifically the password field of SSH configuration.
