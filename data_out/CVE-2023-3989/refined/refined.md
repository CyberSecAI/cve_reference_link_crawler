The provided content is a GitHub page displaying a PDF file named "Jewelry Store System add_customer.php has Cross Site Scripting(Xss) vulnerability.pdf". This suggests the existence of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `add_customer.php` file within the Jewelry Store System project. However, the content does not provide the specifics of the vulnerability itself, only the file name and that it is a PDF.

Based on the filename, the following can be inferred:

*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerable component:** The `add_customer.php` file in the Jewelry Store System application.
*   **Attack vector:** Likely involves injecting malicious scripts through user input fields in the `add_customer.php` form, which are not properly sanitized.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit a page that renders the unsanitized data. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into user input fields processed by `add_customer.php`.
*   **Root cause:**  Likely improper input sanitization and output encoding on the add_customer.php page that makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks

Since the provided content is just the GitHub page and the vulnerability details are in the linked PDF file, this is not sufficient to fully define the vulnerability.
