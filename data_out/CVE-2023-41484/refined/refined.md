- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory leak in the `CImg::load_jpeg` function of the CImg library, specifically when handling certain JPEG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unreleased memory allocation when loading JPEG images using the CImg library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory leak, potentially leading to program crash in prolonged usage, although the maintainer states that it's not a big deal since the program exits immediately after loading.
- **Attack vectors:** Loading a specially crafted or problematic JPEG file that triggers the memory leak within the `CImg::load_jpeg` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious JPEG file.
