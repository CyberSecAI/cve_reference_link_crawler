### **[eddieantonio](/eddieantonio)** commented [Oct 30, 2023](#issuecomment-1785490858)

| Thanks for bringing this to my attention. This is a flaw in the upstream CImg (see: <https://github.com/GreycLab/CImg>). I have upgraded to the latest version, but even then, a memory leak is not a big deal in `imgcat`, since it only opens one (or a few) images, then immediately exits. As such, I am marking this as `wontfix`. |
