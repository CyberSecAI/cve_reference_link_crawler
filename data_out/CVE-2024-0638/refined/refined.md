- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mk\_oracle, mk\_oracle.ps1, and mk\_oracle\_crs agent plugins were vulnerable to privilege escalation because they executed binaries (sqlplus, tnsping, crsctl) without proper checks, allowing an oracle user to replace these binaries with malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability due to insecure execution of binaries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious oracle user can gain root privileges by replacing legitimate binaries with their own scripts, which are then executed by the root user.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attack vector is used by replacing binaries in directories searched by the plugins.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the privileges of an oracle user on the affected system.
