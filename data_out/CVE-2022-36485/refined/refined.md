{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setOpModeCfg` function in TOTOLINK N350RT (V9.3.5u.6139_B20201216) is vulnerable to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability via the `hostName` parameter. The vulnerable code directly passes user-controlled input to the `system` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially leading to complete system compromise, including obtaining a root shell without authorization.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, with the `hostName` parameter containing malicious commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This typically means the attacker must be on the same network as the router or have access through another exploit or existing vulnerability."
