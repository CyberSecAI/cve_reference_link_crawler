Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-4535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The KKProgressbar2 Free WordPress plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in its code, specifically when handling progress bar deletion requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete progress bars without their consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a deletion request to the vulnerable plugin's endpoint.
- The attacker would then need to trick a logged-in administrator into opening the malicious HTML page in their browser. This can be done through various methods such as email phishing, or embedding the link in a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious crafted HTML page.
- The attacker needs to know a valid ID for a progress bar, but this could potentially be brute-forced if the number of IDs is relatively low, or if there are common/predictable IDs used.
