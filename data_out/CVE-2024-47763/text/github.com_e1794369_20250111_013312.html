### @alexcrichton **[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)** commented [May 22, 2024](#issue-2311469206)

Logic in `Config` to conditionally enable tail calls wasn't handling the case where the configured compiler strategy was `Strategy::Auto` meaning that by default tail calls weren't actually enabled. This commit refactors handling of `Strategy` to avoid storing `Strategy::Auto` in `CompilerConfig` so tests against it can use either cranelift or winch.

Sorry, something went wrong.
