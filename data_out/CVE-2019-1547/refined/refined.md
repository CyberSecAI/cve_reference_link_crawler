{
  "CVE-2019-1547": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An EC group was constructed using explicit parameters without a cofactor, causing OpenSSL to fall back to non-side channel resistant code paths.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Side-channel vulnerability in ECDSA signature operation. Timing attack allows an attacker to potentially recover private ECDSA keys when explicit parameters without a cofactor are used.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Full key recovery of ECDSA private keys is possible through timing analysis.",
    "Attack vectors": "Ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor are in use by an application using libcrypto.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures."
