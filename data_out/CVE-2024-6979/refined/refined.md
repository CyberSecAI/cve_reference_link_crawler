- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Less-privileged operator and/or viewer accounts can gain more privileges than designed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential for unauthorized actions due to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Requires complex steps to execute, including knowing account passwords and social engineering attacks to trick the administrator into specific configurations on operator/viewer accounts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know account passwords and must use social engineering on an administrator to perform certain configurations.
