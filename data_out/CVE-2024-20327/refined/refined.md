- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of malformed PPPoE packets received on a router running Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functionality with PPPoE termination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the Cisco IOS XR software processes malformed PPPoE packets, specifically on Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line cards. The software does not properly validate these packets before processing them.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the ppp_ma process to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition affecting all PPPoE traffic across the router.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this by sending crafted PPPoE packets to an affected line card interface that does not have PPPoE termination enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be adjacent to the affected device and able to send packets to the affected line card interface. No authentication is required.
