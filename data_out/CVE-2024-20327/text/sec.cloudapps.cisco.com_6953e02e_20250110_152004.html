This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of malformed PPPoE packets that are received on a router that is running Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functionality with PPPoE termination on a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PPPoE packet to an affected line card interface that does not terminate PPPoE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the ppp\_ma process, resulting in a DoS condition for PPPoE traffic across the router.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-pppma-JKWFgneW>  This advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

For specific questions and further clarification about a PID, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).  **Determine Whether BNG PPPoE is Enabled Globally**  To determine whether BNG PPPoE is enabled globally, use the **show running-config pppoe bba-group** command. If **pppoe bba-group** is present under the broadband aggregation (BBA) group, as shown in the following example, BNG PPPoE is enabled:  ```   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config pppoe bba-groupThu Feb 1 21:19:21.003 UTCpppoe bba-group TS-PPPOE service selection disable sessions max limit 32000!RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#   ```  **Determine Whether BNG PPPoE is Enabled on an Interface**  To determine whether an interface has BNG PPPoE enabled, use the **show running-config interface | utility egrep "interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id"** command. If **pppoe enable bba-group** is configured on an interface or sub-interface, BNG PPoE is enabled.  The following example shows the output for a device that has the following characteristics:    + Interface Bundle-Ether41.50 has PPPoE enabled.   + Interface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is configured as part of Bundle-Ether41.   + Interface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is on a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card A99-4HG-FLEX-TR and has PPPoE enabled. ```   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config interface | utility egrep "interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id" Thu Feb 1 22:12:42.769 UTCinterface Bundle-Ether20interface Bundle-Ether20interface Bundle-Ether41interface Bundle-Ether41.50 pppoe enable bba-group TS-PPPOEinterface Bundle-Ether41.55interface Loopback0interface TenGigE0/3/0/0 bundle id 41 mode on...   ```  **Note:** For clarity, the preceding output was altered to show fewer interfaces.
