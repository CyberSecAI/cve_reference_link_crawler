- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the power consumption differences of the Atmel SAM E70/S70/V70/V71 microcontrollers when the security bit is enabled or disabled. Specifically, there is a noticeable difference in power consumption during the flash controller (EEFC) initialization after reset, which occurs before code execution. By injecting a voltage fault (glitch) during this specific time, the security bit can be bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the susceptibility of the EEFC to voltage fault injection during the security bit loading process. The security mechanism relies on a stable power supply during this phase.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the security bit, which is intended to protect the firmware, SRAM, core registers, and internal peripherals. This results in full control of the microcontroller, including the ability to dump the flash memory, access SRAM, control peripherals, and potentially extract sensitive information such as intellectual property or keys.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves voltage fault injection, specifically a glitch in the VDDCORE power supply. This is done using a tool like ChipWhisperer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires physical access to the microcontroller and the ability to interface with its power supply pins (VDDCORE). Additionally, the attacker needs specialized tools such as a power supply, an oscilloscope, a JLink debugger, and a voltage fault injection tool like ChipWhisperer. They need to be able to analyze power consumption traces and write code to execute a timed glitch on the power supply during the sensitive part of the boot process.
