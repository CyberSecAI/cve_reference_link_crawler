- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `audio_merchant_save_settings` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can trick a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a link, which executes a forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or request and trick a site administrator to click on it.
