- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure occurs while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious PAR file with the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious PAR file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable software.
