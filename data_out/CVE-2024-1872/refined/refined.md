Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `button_shortcode` function of the Button plugin, where it deserializes untrusted input. Specifically, the function uses `get_post_meta` to retrieve data, which is then passed to `json_decode`. If the retrieved data is crafted to be a serialized PHP object, `json_decode` can deserialize it, leading to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **PHP Object Injection:** The core weakness is the deserialization of untrusted data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects.
- **Deserialization of untrusted data:** The `button_shortcode` function takes input from `get_post_meta` and passes it to `json_decode`, without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** If a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain exists within the WordPress installation (either in the plugin itself, or within another active plugin/theme), an attacker could leverage the injected object to execute arbitrary code, delete files, or retrieve sensitive data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the injected object and available POP chain, attackers can potentially modify application data and settings.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, the exploitation could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `button_shortcode` function, which is accessible through the `WD_Button` shortcode.
- An attacker can inject a crafted serialized PHP object via `button_custom_setting_$id` post meta.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access. This role allows users to create and modify posts and pages, where the vulnerable shortcode can be used and manipulated.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Shortcode:**  The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `WD_Button` shortcode and the fact that it deserializes data from `button_custom_setting_$id`.
- **POP chain (if code execution is desired):**  To achieve code execution the attacker needs a viable POP chain within the target system (can be in the Button plugin itself or other active plugins or theme).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Wordfence article notes there isn't a POP chain in the vulnerable plugin itself. However, it states the potential for exploitation exists if a POP chain is present through an additional plugin or theme.
*   The vulnerable code resides in `inc/shortcode.php`, specifically within the `button_shortcode` function.
*   The fix involves updating to version 1.1.28 or later.
