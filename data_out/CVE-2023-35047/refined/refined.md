- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The All Bootstrap Blocks plugin for WordPress versions 1.3.6 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact would depend on the actions the attacker can trigger.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious web page that triggers a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to entice a logged-in user to unknowingly trigger the malicious request.
