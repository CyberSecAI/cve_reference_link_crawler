- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An array out-of-bounds write in the `rtw_get_tx_power_params` function within the Realtek rtw88 wireless driver. Specifically, when the function calculates the transmit power, it uses the channel group to index into a tx power array, but for channel 14, it was using an out-of-bounds index.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Array out-of-bounds write due to incorrect calculation of channel group index, leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The out-of-bounds access could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing system instability or a crash due to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when setting the transmit power for channel 14 in the 2.4GHz band. This can occur during normal wireless operations such as scanning for available networks or configuring a channel. An attacker with the ability to control the channel or trigger a scan on channel 14 could trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger wireless operations that involve setting the channel and calculating transmit power. This could be achieved by being in range of the vulnerable wireless network or through remote methods if such a capability is exposed. The attacker does not require root access, as the vulnerability is within the network driver code.
