Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue within the Easy Digital Downloads plugin. Specifically, there's a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is **Broken Access Control**. The absence of proper checks makes it possible for a user with a lower privilege level (specifically, a "Subscriber") to perform actions meant for higher-level users.

**Impact of Exploitation:** While the specific impact is not detailed, the general impact of broken access control is that an attacker can bypass intended restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute privileged operations. The content states that this particular vulnerability has a "low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited" but the specific impact is not clarified.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the missing authorization or authentication checks. Since the vulnerability is within the plugin, the attack would likely involve interacting with the affected plugin functionality, possibly through crafted requests or other forms of user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be at least a "Subscriber" user, indicating a user with a basic account within the WordPress site. They don't need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The Easy Digital Downloads plugin, versions 3.2.12 and below, suffers from a Broken Access Control vulnerability. This allows a user with the "Subscriber" role to execute actions meant for higher-privileged users, because of the missing authorization checks. This vulnerability has a low severity. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.3.1.
