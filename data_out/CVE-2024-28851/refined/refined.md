Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28851:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a helper script used in the Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector. The script was fetching a file from a Microsoft domain using `wget` and then executing it via `source`. A malicious insider could potentially replace the content at the Microsoft domain with malicious code and then manipulate another user to execute the script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure dependency retrieval:** The script directly downloads and executes a script from an external, uncontrolled domain without proper verification (e.g., checksum validation) making it vulnerable to supply chain attack by replacing the original file.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** By replacing the legitimate script with a malicious one and then executing it locally with user interaction, an attacker with local access could potentially gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Potential elevation of privileges:** A local attacker could gain higher privileges on the system where the script is executed.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By replacing the script with their malicious code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The initial attack vector is through the script's download of an external file. A malicious actor would need to compromise the file served by the Microsoft domain.
- A malicious insider must then manipulate the user to execute the modified script with elevated privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious insider:** The attacker needs to be a malicious insider without admin privileges on the system.
- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the same system where the script is run.
- **Ability to manipulate users:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to run the maliciously modified script.
- **Compromise Microsoft Domain (theoretical):** The attacker would need to have the ability to modify content at the Microsoft domain. This vector is more theoretical since the provided content does not give specific detail on how to achieve this part of the exploit.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "moderate" severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 4.0.
- The vulnerability was patched on February 9, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector.
- The advisory recommends users of the helper script to use the latest version.
- The vulnerability was reported through Snowflake's bug bounty program.
