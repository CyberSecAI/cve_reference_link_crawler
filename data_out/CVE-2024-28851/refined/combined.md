# Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector Security Advisory

published

## Package

Helper script

## Description

### Synopsis

Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector has addressed a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a [helper script](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh) for the Hive MetaStore Connector. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector.

### 1. Impacted Products

[Helper script](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh) for the Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector.

### 2. Introduction

On February 09, 2024, Snowflake patched a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in the helper script. We recommend using the latest version [available here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh). No action is required if you are not using the helper script.

### 3. Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

#### 3.1 Description

Snowflake was informed through our bug bounty program of a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a script made available by Snowflake for the Hive MetaStore Connector. The vulnerability has been evaluated to have a medium severity with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [4.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

#### 3.2 Scenarios and attack vector(s)

A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system.

#### 3.3 Our response

On February 8, 2024 Gee-netics (<https://hackerone.com/gee-netics>) reported the issue to Snowflake via our bug bounty program. On February 9, 2024, Snowflake released a patch for the [helper script](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh) for the Hive MetaStore Connector.

#### 3.4 Resolution

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
