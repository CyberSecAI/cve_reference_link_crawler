### CVE-2024-5325
Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Form Vibes WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `fv_export_data` parameter and a lack of proper preparation in the existing SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and validate the `fv_export_data` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-supplied data is not adequately escaped or parameterized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL queries are not properly prepared to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow attackers to:
- **Extract Sensitive Information:** Gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Manipulate Data:** Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Compromise the Application:** In severe cases, it could lead to full compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `fv_export_data` parameter.
- It can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL code in the parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
