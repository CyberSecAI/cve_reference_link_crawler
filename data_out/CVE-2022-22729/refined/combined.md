1.  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

https://www.first.org/cvss/
CVSS is a common language for scoring IT vulnerabilities independent from any vendors.  It
provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities,
scaling it in numeric scores.
The CVSS scores described in this report are provided “AS IS.”  Yokogawa has no guarantee over
the scores, and the severity caused by the vulnerabilities have to be judged by the users
considering the security measures equipped with the overall systems.
