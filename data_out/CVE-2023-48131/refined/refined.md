{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'CHIGASAKI BAKERY' on Line exposes the channel access token to the client-side.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200). The channel access token, a critical credential for securing communication within Line, is leaked in the response of a request.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can obtain the channel access token. This token can be used to broadcast malicious messages to users of the mini-app, including website links and fraud information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening the mini-app 'CHIGASAKI BAKERY' on Line. The channel access token is present in the response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to have the Line app installed and be able to access the 'CHIGASAKI BAKERY' mini-app. No special privileges or network position is needed. The attacker needs to send a request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card` and extract the exposed channel access token from the response."
