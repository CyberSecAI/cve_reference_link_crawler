MongoDB Atlas for an existing cluster in Ops Manager or MongoDB Cloud Manager, and migrate
all data from the source cluster to a target cluster in Atlas.
You can also migrate a MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas.

For more information, see [Workflow for Live Migration](../../tutorial/migrate-to-atlas/#lm-workflow) in the
Atlas documentation.

To live migrate your deployment from Ops Manager or MongoDB Cloud Manager to
Atlas, see [Migrate from Ops Manager to Atlas](../../tutorial/migrate-to-atlas/#migrate-to-atlas).

### Ops Manager Server 4.4.11[Â¶](#onprem-server-4-4-11 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2021-04-01*

* Updates an outdated comment in the `conf-mms.properties` file.
  Even though Ops Manager 4.4.11 does not add any new parameters to this
  file, the upgrade process detects that the file had changed.
  To avoid having to manually reconfigure Ops Manager, ensure that Ops Manager
  uses the current version of this file after the upgrade. Create and
  store backup copies of all your configuration files, to avoid losing
  important Ops Manager configuration.
  + For upgrades that use the `.deb` package,
    the [upgrade process](../../tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager/#upgrade-on-prem-with-deb) prompts you
    to choose which version of the `conf-mms.properties` file
    Ops Manager should use. Choose the current `conf-mms.properties`
    file.
  + For upgrades that use the `rpm` package,
    the [upgrade process](../../tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager/#upgrade-on-prem-with-rpm) saves
    the `conf-mms.properties` file as the
    `conf-mms.properties.rpmsave`
    file. Use the `mv` command to rename
    `conf-mms.properties.rpmsave`
    to `conf-mms.properties`. This ensures that Ops Manager uses the
    current file after the upgrade.
* Fixes a bug in the MongoDB usage report where backing databases are
  not correctly identified.
* Fixes a bug in the MongoDB usage report where Ops Manager could
  potentially find duplicate hosts based on network aliases.
* Fixes a bug that causes some MongoDB versions to be considered as
  custom builds when validating the Automation configuration.
* Fixes a bug that disallows configuring LDAP group names longer
  than 100 characters.
* Updates the MongoDB Agent to [10.14.22.6489](../mongodb-agent/#mongodb-10-14-22-6489).
* Requires [MongoDB Database Tools 100.3.1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools//release-notes/database-tools-changelog#100.3.1-changelog?tck=docs).
* Changes the [protocolVersion](../../reference/api/automation-config/automation-config-parameters/#autoconfig-mongodb-replicasets)
  API parameter from an integer to a string. For example, previously,
  you could specify `1` for this parameter. Now, you must specify
  `"1"` for this parameter instead.

CVE ID: [CVE-2021-20335](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20335)

| Title | SSL may be unexpectedly disabled during upgrade of multiple-server MongoDB Ops Manager |
| --- | --- |
| Description | For MongoDB Ops Manager 4.2.X with multiple OM application servers, that have SSL turned on for their MongoDB processes, the upgrade to MongoDB Ops Manager 4.4.X triggers a bug where Automation thinks SSL is being turned off, and can disable SSL temporarily for members of the cluster. This issue is temporary and eventually corrects itself after MongoDB Ops Manager instances have finished upgrading to MongoDB Ops Manager 4.4. In addition, customers must be running with clientCertificateMode=OPTIONAL / [`allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates=true`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-net.ssl.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates "(in docs v)") to be impacted. |

  Manager deployments. Groups are now known as Projects. You can put
  multiple Projects under an Organization.
* Added support for nested LDAP groups via the `member` field when
  configuring Ops Manager to use LDAP for Ops Manager authentication.

  Although Ops Manager 3.6 supports the use of either `member` or
  `memberOf` for configuration, support for LDAP via the `memberOf`
  field will be removed in a future version of Ops Manager. When
  possible, use `member` instead.
* Added support for a new [Agent API Key model](../../tutorial/manage-agent-api-key/). Multiple Agent API Keys can now be
  associated with a project. This gives users the ability to perform
  Agent key rotation.
* The bundled JDK is version 8u152.

#### Automation[Â¶](#automation "Permalink to this headline")

* Added support for management of the [MongoDB Connector for
  Business Intelligence](../../tutorial/deploy-bi-connector/). The MongoDB
  Connector for Business Intelligence allows you to query a MongoDB

  processes. The logs are sent to the Ops Manager server and available
  for download by Ops Manager administrators.
* Ended support for the `seedSecondary.sh` script. You cannot run the
  `seedSecondary.sh` script on any MongoDB database running MongoDB
  3.6 or later. To learn more about restoring a snapshot, see
  [Restore a Completed Snapshot](../../tutorial/restore-full-snapshot-http/).
* Agent Upgrade: [Automation Agent 4.5.7.2375](../automation-agent/#automation-4-5-7-2375)

#### Backup[Â¶](#id7 "Permalink to this headline")

* Added support for [queryable backups](../../tutorial/query-backup/).
  This functionality allows you to query specific backup snapshot. You
  can use the queryable backups to:

  + Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.
  + Compare previous versions of data against the current data.
  + Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing
    data from multiple snapshots.

  Important

  On Windows, [queryable restores](../../tutorial/query-backup/)
  work on MongoDB 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 snapshots once the Ops Manager
  [Backup Daemon](../../reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon) can access
  [MongoDB 3.4.11](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/3.4-changelog/#std-label-3.4.11-changelog "(in docs v)") or later.
* Added support for IBM Cloud Object Storage and DellEMC Elastic Cloud
  Storage for S3 blockstore snapshot storage

* Added [Real-Time Metrics](../../view-real-time-metrics/#real-time-metrics-status-tab).
* Added the [Performance Advisor](../../tutorial/performance-advisor/).
  The Performance Advisor monitors any operation with a query predicate
  that MongoDB considers slow and suggests new indexes to improve query
  performance.
* Added the [Data Explorer](../../data-explorer/). This feature
  provides the ability to introspect collections in your managed
  MongoDB deployments via the Data Explorer view.
* Agent Upgrade: [Monitoring Agent 6.1.1.395](../monitoring-agent/#monitoring-6-1-1-395).

#### Release Advisories for Ops Manager 3.6[Â¶](#release-advisories-for-onprem-3-6 "Permalink to this headline")

Before upgrading Ops Manager from 3.4 to 3.6, complete the following
actions:

* Upgrade all backing databases to MongoDB 3.2 or later.
* Upgrade the monitoring schema.

  To monitor the schema upgrade:

  1. Click Admin.
  2. Click Ops Manager Config.
  3. Click the Miscellaneous tab.

     The progress should be shown before the
     Default Monitoring Data Retention heading.
* Change [`mms.minimumTLSVersion`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.minimumTLSVersion "mms.minimumTLSVersion") if you must support
  older TLS versions.

  Ops Manager Application supports TLS 1.2 only by default.

  To re-enable ciphers which have been disabled, change
  [`mms.disableCiphers`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.disableCiphers "mms.disableCiphers").

  Warning

  Consider the security implications carefully before doing this.

#### Deprecation[Â¶](#deprecation "Permalink to this headline")

#### Release Advisories for Ops Manager 3.4[Â¶](#release-advisories-for-onprem-3-4 "Permalink to this headline")

Before upgrading Ops Manager from 2.0.x to 3.4, complete the following
actions:

* Upgrade backing databases to at least MongoDB 3.0.8.
  MongoDB 2.6 is no longer allowed as a backing store.
* Ensure the data partitions for the Ops Manager Application Database have at
  least 50% free disk space.

  Once the Ops Manager upgrade to 3.4 completes, Ops Manager begins
  migrating of all monitoring data to a new schema in the background.
  This migration requires significant free disk space.
* Add necessary IP addresses or CIDR blocks for to the access lists
  for any API clients connecting to the Automation configuration
  endpoints.
* Back up the `mms.conf` file in your current installation if you
  have modified it.

  This is not a regular practice as `mms.conf` contains platform and
  network administration settings for Java VM and Ops Manager network port
  settings. You must use the new `mms.conf` file the upgrade
  installs. Reapply any modifications from your backed up copy to the
  new `mms.conf` after completing the upgrade.

For procedures to upgrade to 3.4, see
[Upgrade Ops Manager](../../tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager/).

### Ops Manager Server 2.0.0[Â¶](#onprem-server-2-0-0 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-12-08*

#### General[Â¶](#id12 "Permalink to this headline")

* Added support to monitor, back up, and automate MongoDB 3.2
  deployments.
* Single Ops Manager Package: there is no longer a separate package for
  the Backup Daemon. The single Ops Manager package installs both the
  Ops Manager Application and the Backup Daemon. You can configure any server
  with Ops Manager to handle backups through the Backup Admin interface.
* Configuration in the Database: the Ops Manager application configuration
  is now stored in the application database rather than in configuration
  files. This allows for central configuration management.

  Each Ops Manager instance, on each server, must be configured with
  information on how to connect to the Application Database. Local
  config files override the information in the database: as such,
  switching to configuration in the database is not required, but is
  recommended.
* Backup agent port change: Ops Manager no longer requires a separate port
  for backup traffic. All HTTP traffic is now over a single port. By
  default, Ops Manager uses port `8080`.
* Ops Manager 2.0 updates the admin interface to show the topology of
  Ops Manager software, the application database, and any backup
  databases.
* Added support to convert to LDAP authentication for Ops Manager users at
  any time, with no downtime.
* Upgraded to JDK8u66.

#### Automation[Â¶](#id13 "Permalink to this headline")

* Added support for X.509 member authentication.
* Improved handling of adding members to replica sets: to avoid
  disrupting majority writes, new members are now added to
  [replica sets](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set "(in docs v)") as `priority=0`, `votes=0`
  until they reach secondary state, after which Ops Manager automatically
  updates the configuration to match the [priority](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].priority) and
  [votes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].votes)
  value specified in the deployment.
* Added the ability to manage indexes from the Ops Manager UI.
* Improved index creation: indexes are now created in a rolling
  fashion.
* Added Automation support for Windows MongoDB instances.

#### Monitoring[Â¶](#id14 "Permalink to this headline")

* Added a new profiler with Suggested Indexes.
* Added support for maintenance windows during which time Ops Manager does
  not send alert notifications.

#### Backup[Â¶](#id15 "Permalink to this headline")

* Filesystem snapshot storage: added the ability to store snapshots
  on a plain shared file system instead of a MongoDB instance. With
  filesystem storage, Ops Manager stores snapshots in a directory
  hierarchy and the data files themselves are compressed using gzip.
* Backup agent port change: Ops Manager no longer requires a separate port
  for backup traffic. All HTTP traffic is now over a single port. By
  default, Ops Manager uses port `8080`

  Ops Manager will automatically update any Backup Agents managed by
  Automation to use the new port. You will need to manually update any
  Backup Agents set up manually after upgrading Ops Manager. The upgrade
  instructions describe how to configure the `mothership` field in
  the configuration files of non-automated Backup Agents.
* Sync store no longer required: a dedicated sync store is no longer
  required: Backup [initial syncs](../../reference/glossary/#term-initial-sync) are âstreamedâ
  to the Backup Daemon and only use a small amount of temporary space
  in the [oplog store](../../reference/glossary/#term-oplog-store-database).
* Automated restores: added a new option to automatically restore a
  backup to a running [replica set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set "(in docs v)") or [sharded cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster "(in docs v)").
* Added support for namespace whitelisting, which allows you to back up
  only a subset of your data.
* Added the ability to manage HTTP restore link expiration from the
  Ops Manager UI and through the API for each individual restore request.
* Added support for the Backup Daemon to download required MongoDB
  binaries from the Ops Manager web server when they are not available
  locally.

#### Associated Agent Updates[Â¶](#associated-agent-updates "Permalink to this headline")

* [Automation Agent 2.5.11.1484](../automation-agent/#automation-2-5-11-1484)
* [Monitoring Agent 3.9.1.238](../monitoring-agent/#monitoring-3-9-1-238)
* [Backup Agent 3.9.0.336](../backup-agent/#backup-3-9-0-336)

#### Release Advisories for Ops Manager 2.0[Â¶](#release-advisories-for-onprem-2-0 "Permalink to this headline")

Before upgrading to Ops Manager 2.0, ensure the following are true:

Backup Database

Databases that store the [Snapshot Storage](../../core/system-overview/#backup-database) must be online.

There are data migrations that touch the various backup data stores
that make up the [Snapshot Storage](../../core/system-overview/#backup-database). Any data stores that are no
longer in use should be deleted through the Ops Manager UI before
upgrading.

Backup Daemon

The Ops Manager package installs the [Backup Daemon](../../reference/glossary/#term-backup-daemon).
When started, the Ops Manager package automatically starts two
services: the Ops Manager Application and the Backup Daemon. You choose on
which hosts to âactivateâ the Backup Daemon. The daemon always
runs, but performs no operations until activated.

After upgrading to 2.0, a host that runs **only** the Ops Manager Application continues also runs a âdormantâ Backup Daemon service. The Backup Daemon remains dormant as long as you do not activate it.

A host that runs **only** a Backup Daemon runs Ops Manager with an âactivatedâ Backup Daemon and a âdormantâ Ops Manager Application. The Ops Manager Application remains dormant as long as you do not direct HTTP traffic to it.

Backup HTTP Service

Change the [`mothership`](../../reference/mongodb-agent-settings/#bsetting.mothership "mothership") setting in all Backup Agent
configuration files for any **manually** installed agents to use port
`8080`. Any **manually installed** Backup Agents that are not set
to use port `8080` cannot connect to Ops Manager You must have access
to the hosts running any manually installed Backup Agents.

Beginning with Ops Manager 2.0, there is no Backup HTTP Service on port
`8081`. Any Backup Agents that Automation manages are updated to
use the new port (`8080`) automatically.

Agent Updates
The agents have not been updated before the Ops Manager Application has been upgraded. If you use Automation,
Ops Manager prompts you to update the agents after you upgrade.
Follow the prompts to update the agents through the Ops Manager Application.
Do *not* update the agents manually.
conf-mms.properties
Beginning in 2.0, Ops Manager stores global configuration settings
in the Ops Manager Application Database and stores only local
settings in the Ops Manager hostâs `conf-mms.properties` file.
The upgrade procedure uses the existing `conf-mms.properties`
file to connect to the Ops Manager Application Database before replacing
the existing file with the new, smaller 2.0 file.
Restore properties

The following properties no longer apply and are replaced by
settings specified when initiating a restore:

* `mms.backup.restore.linkExpirationHours`
* `mms.backup.restore.linkUnlimitedUses`

* If you have modified the `mms.conf` file in your current
  installation, you have backed it up.

  This is not a regular practice as `mms.conf` contains platform and
  network administration settings for Java VM and Ops Manager network port
  settings. You must use the new `mms.conf` file the upgrade
  installs. Reapply any modifications from your backed up copy to the
  new `mms.conf` after completing the upgrade.

See: [Upgrade Ops Manager](../../tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager/) for upgrade instructions
for your operating system.

### Ops Manager Server 1.8.0[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-8-0 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-06-23*

#### Security[Â¶](#id16 "Permalink to this headline")

* Automation now supports
  [SSL](../../tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment/) and
  MongoDB Enterprise authentication mechanisms:
  [Kerberos](../../tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group/),
  [LDAP](../../tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group/), and
  [X.509](../../tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group/).

  Ops Manager 1.8 can start new MongoDB instances using SSL and enterprise
  authentication mechanisms and import existing instances using SSL and
  enterprise authentication for management.

  access external services.
* Added [support for self-signed CAs and client certificates](../../tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication/#ldap-over-ssl) when using SSL LDAP for Ops Manager user authentication.

#### Alerts[Â¶](#id17 "Permalink to this headline")

* [System Alerts](../../core/system-alerts/): system alerts allow an
  Ops Manager Administrator to receive alerts when the state of the
  software itself is unhealthy.
* [Global Alerts](../../tutorial/manage-global-alerts/): global alerts
  allow an Ops Manager administrator to monitor any set of Ops Manager groups
  without needing to configure the alerts on a group-by-group basis.
* Added the ability to [deliver Project, Global, and System alerts
  via an HTTP webhook](../../tutorial/manage-project-settings/#group-settings-page).
* Lowered the alerting check frequency from five minutes to one minute,
  allowing for more responsive alerts.

#### Automation[Â¶](#id18 "Permalink to this headline")

* Automation now uses distribution-specific builds for MongoDB
  Community Edition when one is available for the operating system and
  version in use. Previously, Automation used the generic MongoDB
  Community Edition build.

  Upgrading the Automation Agent and Ops Manager to the new version will
  not automatically change your MongoDB deployments to a distribution-
  specific build: if you wish to use the distribution-specific build,
  you will need to
  [update the MongoDB version](../../tutorial/change-mongodb-version/).
* Added support to [change the storage engine for a MongoDB
  deployment using Automation](../../tutorial/edit-deployment/).
* **Beta**: Added Automation support for Windows MongoDB instances.
  This feature must be enabled for an Ops Manager group for it to be
  available.

#### Monitoring[Â¶](#id19 "Permalink to this headline")

* Standby Monitoring Agents now check in with Ops Manager more frequently.
  You can now configure the Monitoring Agent session timeout to allow
  for faster failover. See: [Monitoring Failover](../../reference/configuration/#standby-monitoring-agent) for
  more information.

#### Backup[Â¶](#id20 "Permalink to this headline")

* Added the ability to configure the Backup Databaseâs block size.
  The [Configure Block Size in a Blockstore](../../tutorial/configure-block-size/) tutorial describes
  how to configure the size of the blocks in the Backup Databaseâs
  blockstore.
* Added the ability to initiate backup SCP restores through the
  Public API. See: [Restore Jobs](../../reference/api/restore-jobs/).

#### Associated Agent Updates (v1.8)[Â¶](#associated-agent-updates-v1-8 "Permalink to this headline")

* [Automation Agent 2.0.9.1201](../automation-agent/#automation-2-0-9-1201)
* [Monitoring Agent 3.3.1.193](../monitoring-agent/#monitoring-3-3-1-193)
* [Backup Agent 3.4.1.283](../backup-agent/#backup-3-4-1-283)

#### Considerations for Upgrade (v1.8)[Â¶](#considerations-for-upgrade-v1-8 "Permalink to this headline")

* Ops Manager 1.8 requires that the [Ops Manager Application Database](../../core/system-overview/#mms-application-database) and
  [Snapshot Storage](../../core/system-overview/#backup-database) run MongoDB 2.6 or later.
  Ops Manager will not start after upgrade if your backing databases are
  using an earlier version of MongoDB. The MongoDB Manual provides
  upgrade tutorials with each release. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to
  2.6, see: [Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/2.6-upgrade/).
* When you upgrade to Ops Manager 1.8, Ops Manager disables all Automation
  Agents until they are upgraded to [Automation Agent 2.0.9.1201](../automation-agent/#automation-2-0-9-1201). You
  can upgrade the Automation Agents by clicking the link that appears in
  the Please upgrade your agents banner that will appear on
  the Deployment page in the Ops Manager interface.
* Direct upgrade is only allowed from Ops Manager 1.5 and Ops Manager 1.6. To
  upgrade to Ops Manager 1.8 from an earlier version of MongoDB, you must
  first upgrade to Ops Manager 1.6, and then to 1.8.
* In Ops Manager 1.8, [`mms.multiFactorAuth.level`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.multiFactorAuth.level "mms.multiFactorAuth.level") replaces the
  deprecated [`mms.multiFactorAuth.require`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.multiFactorAuth.require "mms.multiFactorAuth.require") setting.
  [`mms.multiFactorAuth.level`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.multiFactorAuth.level "mms.multiFactorAuth.level")
  supports more values than its predecessor.

  Ops Manager will not start with [`mms.multiFactorAuth.require`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.multiFactorAuth.require "mms.multiFactorAuth.require")
  in the properties file, but will report an error indicating that the
  setting has been deprecated, and that you must update your
  configuration.
* Ops Manager 1.8 does not include the Backup HTTP Service: its
  functionality is now part of [System Alerts](../../core/system-alerts/)
  and [Global Alerts](../../tutorial/manage-global-alerts/).
* System Alerts give new insight into the health of Ops Manager and may
  immediately trigger on upgrade if Ops Manager is not in the expected
  state. For example, if your Application or Backup databases have
  startup warnings or if the connection strings to those databases point
  to any unreachable MongoDB instances, Ops Manager will issue an alert.
* The Ops Manager Deployment user interface has been streamlined such that
  the View Mode and Edit Mode dual views have
  been merged into a unified view.

## Ops Manager Server 1.6[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6 "Permalink to this headline")

### Ops Manager Server 1.6.4[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6-4 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-08-17*

* Ops Manager no longer shuts down if the [Ops Manager Application Database](../../core/system-overview/#mms-application-database)
  is unreachable. (This issue was erroneously reported as resolved in
  Ops Manager 1.6.3.)

### Ops Manager Server 1.6.3[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-06-23*

* Agent updates: [Automation Agent 1.4.18.1199-1](../automation-agent/#automation-1-4-18-1199-1)
* Added full support for restores of WiredTiger backups. Previously,
  Ops Manager only supported
  [SCP Individual File](../../tutorial/nav/restore-overview/#delivery-methods-file-formats) restores
  for WiredTiger backups.
* Added optimization to prevent some Backup Daemon background tasks
  from doing excessive logging when databases are down.
* Fixed a user interface issue when displaying an empty Automation
  diff.

### Ops Manager Server 1.6.2[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-04-28*

* Fixed issue with grooms on a WiredTiger backup blockstore.
* Fixed a possible connection leak with the SCP Individual File restore
  type.
* LDAP users are now periodically synced with the LDAP server to
  prevent communications after a user is removed from a group.
* Fixed an issue with backups of MongoDB 3.0 **mongod**
  instances running with the `--setParameter failIndexKeyTooLong=0`
  option.

### Ops Manager Server 1.6.1[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-03-26*

* Agent updates: [Automation Agent 1.4.15.999](../automation-agent/#automation-1-4-15-999).
* **Security Update**: resolved an issue where users removed from LDAP
  groups were not always removed from corresponding Ops Manager
  groups. This upgrade is **highly recommended** for anyone using LDAP
  authentication.
* Selecting wildcards in the Version Manager is no longer supported
  when `automation.versions.source` is set to `local`.
* Added a 1 hour timeout to kill a Backup [head database](../../reference/glossary/#term-head-database) if
  it does not shutdown cleanly.
  You must perform a resync following a hard kill.
* Windows support for Backup Daemon using Windows 64-bit 2008 R2+
  MongoDB builds.
* Fix for Backups stored in
  [WiredTiger](../../core/backup-preparations/#considerations-backup-storage-engine)
  format in which a single collection grows from under 8 GB to over
  8 GB in size.
* The time before an unreachable **mongos** process is
  deactivated is now configurable on a per group basis. See
  [Admin Project Settings](../../tutorial/manage-project-settings/#admin-only-group-settings).
* The time before a standby Monitoring Agent takes over after the
  primary Monitoring Agent stops responding is now configurable to a
  minimum of 90 seconds. See the
  `mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis` setting in
  [Ops Manager Configuration Settings](../../reference/configuration/).
* For Backup HTTP pull restore, the link expiration and the number of
  allowed uses of a link are now configurable.

### Ops Manager Server 1.6.0[Â¶](#onprem-server-1-6-0 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-03-02*

#### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Permalink to this headline")

* Initial release of [Automation](../../application/#automation). Automation manages
  many basic administrative tasks for MongoDB deployments, including
  version upgrades, adding replica set members, adding shards, and
  changing oplog size. You can both
  [import existing deployments](../../tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes/) into Automation
  and [create new deployments](../../tutorial/add-servers-automation/)
  on your provisioned hardware.
* Windows support (Monitoring and Backup only). You can
  [Install Ops Manager](../../tutorial/nav/install-application/) on Microsoft Windows using
  MSI files. Ops Manager supports Windows Server 2008 R2 and above.
* Support for MongoDB 3.0, including support for backups that use the
  [WiredTiger](../../core/backup-preparations/#considerations-backup-storage-engine) storage
  engine.

  To monitor or back up MongoDB 3.0 deployments, you must install
  Ops Manager 1.6 or higher. To monitor a MongoDB 3.0 deployment, you must
  also run Monitoring Agent version 2.7.0 or higher.
* Support for using the SSL and MONGODB-X509 authentication mechanisms
  for the backing MongoDB databases. See
  [Configure the Connections to the Application Database](../../tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-backing-mongodb/).
* Public API endpoints to manage Automation configuration. For more
  information, see [Automation](../../core/api/#api-automation) in the API
  documentation.

#### Improvements[Â¶](#improvements "Permalink to this headline")

* The Ops Managerâs [Administration](../../admin-console/)
  interface provides more information to make it easier to monitor the
  health of the Ops Manager installation.
* The Ops Manager Deployment tab now displays all deployment information
  on one page, with icons for selecting view options. The new Topology
  View groups all hosts by the replica set or sharded cluster they are
  part of. The new Servers View shows information about MongoDB
  processes and Ops Manager agents grouped by server.
* Fixed an issue
  ([MMS-2273](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MMS-2273))
  where, in certain situations, the Backup Agent was not reporting a
  cluster snapshot as potentially inconsistent.
* Improved handling of cursor timeouts by the Backup Agent. To use this
  improvement, upgrade to the latest Backup Agent, which is included
  with Ops Manager. The improvement became available with
  [Backup Agent 2.3.3.209-1](../backup-agent/#backup-2-3-3-209-1).

#### Considerations for Upgrade to 1.6[Â¶](#considerations-for-upgrade-to-1-6 "Permalink to this headline")

* Ops Manager 1.8.0, when released, **will not** support MongoDB 2.4 for
  the [Ops Manager Application Database](../../core/system-overview/#mms-application-database) and [Snapshot Storage](../../core/system-overview/#backup-database).
  Ops Manager Server 1.8.0 *will* continue to support MongoDB 2.4 for your
  monitored and backed-up databases.
* Ops Manager 1.6.0 supports direct upgrades only from MMS On Prem 1.3 and
  above.
* The procedure to configure Ops Manager to run with HTTPS has changed and
  is greatly simplified. The previous procedure no longer works. For
  the new procedure, see [Configure TLS Connections to Ops Manager](../../tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-web-interface/).
* The connection string to the backup blockstore database is now
  configured through the Administration interfaceâs
  [Blockstores page](../../admin/backup/snapshot-storage-page/#blockstores-page) and not through the
  `mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` field in the `conf-daemon.properties`
  configuration file.
* Ops Manager no longer requires you to supply the replica set name of the
  backing MongoDB instances. The `mongo.replicaSet` and
  `mongo.backupdb.replicaSet` properties have been removed from the
  configuration files. These properties had previously controlled
  whether Ops Manager treated a connection to a backing instance as a
  standalone or replica set, for the purpose of setting the write
  concern. Ops Manager now sets write concern based on how many hosts are
  supplied in the connection string.
* You can disable Automation for the entire Ops Manager installation
  through the `mms.featureFlag.automation` setting in the
  `conf-daemon.properties` [configuration file](../../reference/configuration/).
* Removed the Dashboards view from the Ops Manager UI. You can
  view monitoring metrics from the Deployment tab.
  See: [View Deployment Metrics](../../tutorial/view-diagnostics/) for an overview
  of the available metrics and how to access them.

## MMS Onprem Server 1.5[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5 "Permalink to this headline")

### MMS Onprem Server 1.5.5[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-5 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-03-26*

* **Security Update**: resolved issue where users removed from LDAP
  groups were not always removed from corresponding Ops Manager groups.
  This upgrade is **highly recommended** for anyone using LDAP
  authentication.

### MMS Onprem Server 1.5.4[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-4 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2015-03-18*

* Fixed race condition that could cause the Backup Daemon to hang when
  the MongoDB process for a [head database](../../reference/glossary/#term-head-database) fails to start.
* Fixed an issue where a rollback occurring shortly after a terminate
  could step on the terminate.
* The time before an unreachable **mongos** process is
  deactivated is now configurable on a per group basis. See
  [Admin Project Settings](../../tutorial/manage-project-settings/#admin-only-group-settings).
* The time before a standby Monitoring Agent takes over after the
  primary Monitoring Agent stops responding is now configurable to a
  minimum of 90 seconds. See the
  `mms.monitoring.agent.session.timeoutMillis` setting in
  [Ops Manager Configuration Settings](../../reference/configuration/).
* For Backup HTTP pull restore, the link expiration and the number of
  allowed uses of a link are now configurable.

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.3[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-12-17*

Significant improvements in performance for the processing of MMS OnPrem
Monitoring data for MMS OnPrem Projects with a large number of hosts

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.2[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-11-18*

* Added Support for archive restores (`.tar.gz`) for databases whose
  filenames exceed 100 characters.
* API: Skip missed points in metrics data, instead of returning empty
  data.
* API: Return correct number of data points when querying metric data
  with the period option.
* Backup Agent update to `2.3.3.209-1`

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.1[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-09-26*

* Fix cases where replica set member alerts (e.g. no primary, number
  of healthy members) could send false positives.
* Skip `backup-daemon` `rootDirectory` and
  `mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` overlap check when the
  `mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is on a different
  host.
* `mms-gen-key` script handles userâs effective group being
  different than the username.
* Security enhancements.

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.5.0[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-5-0 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-09-02*

#### Considerations for Upgrade[Â¶](#considerations-for-upgrade "Permalink to this headline")

* MMS OnPrem *only* supports direct upgrades from 1.3 and 1.4.
* Change in configurations and policy for 2FA: Two-factor
  authentication must now be explicitly enabled using the
  [`mms.multiFactorAuth.require`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.multiFactorAuth.require "mms.multiFactorAuth.require") setting.
* The default LDAP group separator became `;;`. Previously the
  separator was `,`. See the [LDAP configuration](../../reference/config/ui-settings/#default-ldap-separator) documentation for more information.
* Suppressed hosts will only remain suppressed for 30 minutes.

  Previously, if after deleting a host, from MMS OnPrem Monitoring the
  hostname and port combination would be added to a suppression list
  with an infinite lifetime. The suppression list prevented a race
  condition where host in a cluster would be auto-discovered by another
  member of a deployment before the host could was fully removed. Now,
  hostname and port combinations remain on the suppression list for
  only 30 minutes.
* Set the [`mms.remoteIp.header`](../../reference/configuration/#mms.remoteIp.header "mms.remoteIp.header") in the
  `conf-mms.properties` file if clients access the MMS OnPrem
  Application via a load balancer.
* `mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is no longer in
  `conf-mms.properties`. This was previously a required field in this
  file. It remains in the backup daemonsâs `conf-daemon.properties`.
* Stored MongoDB profile data is not transferred between OnPrem 1.4
  and OnPrem 1.5 during the upgrade process.

#### Improvements[Â¶](#id21 "Permalink to this headline")

* When an MMS OnPrem Backup job fails to bind, the system periodically
  and automatically retries.
* All MMS OnPrem Backup jobs will retry indefinitely.
* Point in Time restores are now available with one second granularity.

#### New Features[Â¶](#id22 "Permalink to this headline")

* MMS OnPrem [Public API](../../reference/api/).
* Explicit support for multiple MMS OnPrem backup blockstore databases
  and the ability to pin MMS OnPrem Projects to specific backup daemons
  and databases. See
  [Assign Snapshot Stores to Specific Data Centers](../../tutorial/assign-snapshot-stores-to-data-center/).
* MMS OnPrem can authenticate using LDAP to both the database backing
  MMS OnPrem and the monitored and backed up MongoDB deployments.
  See [Configure Ops Manager Users for LDAP Authentication and Authorization](../../tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication/#security-ldap).
* Enhanced auditing. See [Audit Events](../../reference/audit-events/) for more
  information.
* Ability to acknowledge alerts with comments.
* New cluster page that shows individual, sum or average metrics for
  all shards in a cluster.

## MMS OnPrem Server 1.4[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-4 "Permalink to this headline")

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.4.3[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-4-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-07-22*

* Addressed issues related to Backup Job assignment for 2.6.x clusters
  that used the [`clusterMonitor`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-clusterMonitor "(in docs v)") role to support MMS OnPrem
  Monitoring.
* Fixed problem importing email addresses for users for deployments
  that use LDAP integration.
* Fixed rare race condition caused high CPU usage in the MMS OnPrem
  HTTP Service if the application cannot connect to one of the backing
  databases.
* Additional security enhancements.

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.4.2[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-4-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-05-29*

* Critical bug fix for backing up MongoDB 2.6 deployments that include
  user or custom role definitions:

  + The `system.version` collection in the admin database will
    be included in all future snapshots.
  + The `system.roles` collection in the admin database will be
    included after a new initial sync is performed.

  Users capturing backups of MongoDB 2.6 replica sets or clusters with
  MMS OnPrem that include custom role definitions should perform a new
  initial sync. Taking a new initial sync will ensure that the role
  definitions are included in the backup.
* Disable MongoDB `usePowerOf2Sizes` for insert-only MMS
  OnPrem Backup collections.
* Speed optimization for MMS OnPrem Backup HTTP pull restores.
* Fix for LDAP integration, MMS OnPrem now passes full `dn` correctly
  when authenticating the user.

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.4.1[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-4-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-04-28*

* Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters using Kerberos
  authentication.
* Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters running specific custom
  MongoDB builds provided by MongoDB, Inc.
* Fix validation issue preventing Backup of MongoDB 2.6.0 clusters.
* Reduced log noise from Monitoring Agent when monitoring MongoDB 2.0
  or unreachable `mongod`s.

### MMS OnPrem Server 1.4.0[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-4-0 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2014-04-08*

* Includes MMS OnPrem Backup: continuous backup with point-in-time
  recovery of replica sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded
  clusters.
* Finer-grained roles and permissions.
* Improved user interface for alerts.
* Enhanced Activity Feed for auditing of all activity.
* Monitoring Agent distributed as OS-specific binary. Python dependency
  removed.
* LDAP integration for managing users and groups.

MMS OnPrem 1.4.0 requires MongoDB 2.4.9+ instances for [backing
storage](../../tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances/).

## MMS OnPrem Server 1.3[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2013-12-01*

* Packaging/support for Debian and SUSE Linux.
* Kerberos authentication support between MMS OnPrem server and backing
  MongoDBs, as well as between Monitoring Agent and the MongoDBs it
  monitors.
* OnPrem users can be overall site administrators. (MMS OnPrem Admins)
* New admin section where MMS OnPrem Admins can manage user roles and
  message banners.
* Tunable advanced password and session management configurations.
* Encryption key rotation, more specific CORS policy, auth tokens
  removed from chart URLs, and other security enhancements.

## MMS OnPrem Server 1.2[Â¶](#mms-onprem-server-1-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Released 2013-07-24*

* Redesigned user interface and enhanced algorithm to auto-discover
  hosts and derive host topology.
