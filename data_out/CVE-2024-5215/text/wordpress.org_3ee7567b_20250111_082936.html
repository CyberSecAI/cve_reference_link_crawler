If you are looking for a vertical slider to make in Elementor. Steer clear of this crap. After 3 hours of making the damn thing – only 5 slides with each getting its own Elementor Template – it worked for all of 5 minutes on the front end before all but 1 slide suddenly and inexplicably became blank slides.No amount of cache clearing, recreating, regenerating files and data helped. Don’t waste your time with this crap.
