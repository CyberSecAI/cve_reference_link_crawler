```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application RttHlp.exe (renamed jdekl.exe by the attacker) loads VCL120.BPL from the same directory without proper validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled search path vulnerability. The application loads a BPL file from the same directory as the executable without validating its authenticity, allowing for DLL sideloading.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current logged-in user.",
  "Attack vectors": "A threat actor places a malicious VCL120.BPL file in the same directory as the vulnerable executable (RttHlp.exe/renamed jdekl.exe). When the application is executed, it loads the malicious BPL file, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious BPL file in the same directory as the vulnerable executable. This might involve previous access to the system. The attacker also needs to trick the victim to execute the renamed executable."
