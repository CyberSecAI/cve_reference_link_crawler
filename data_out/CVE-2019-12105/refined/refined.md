Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in Supervisor's `inet_http_server`. By default, this server is disabled, but if enabled without setting a username and password, it becomes an open server accessible to anyone who can reach the configured port. This allows unauthenticated users to read logs and restart services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of mandatory authentication on the `inet_http_server`. While Supervisor provides options for setting a username and password, it defaults to an open server if these are not configured.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The `inet_http_server` is disabled by default, but the system does not enforce authentication, meaning the user has to be aware to enable and configure authentication. 
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The `inet_http_server` does not support any form of encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping in untrusted environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive data from application logs.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can restart services, causing disruption.
*   **Remote Control:** Attackers gain remote control over the Supervisor instance via `supervisorctl` and the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the machine running `supervisord` on the port that has been configured for the `inet_http_server`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any authentication.
*   The attacker needs network access to the server and port that the `inet_http_server` is running on.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a misconfiguration and not a bug in the code itself.
*   The `inet_http_server` is intended for use within a trusted environment only.
*   The fix includes adding a warning in the documentation and a security warning in the example configuration file (`sample.conf`).
*   The Supervisor project does not provide a default configuration file that enables the `inet_http_server` functionality.
*   The project does not control third-party packages that might include their own configuration files.
*   A critical log message is output if the server starts without authentication.
