| So, I was search for vulnerabites in my work company and I founded supervisord, it's a good service but the user don't need authetication for view logs ou restart a service  Supervisor requires that a configuration file be created before `supervisord` can be started. It will not start without one. This project, Supervisor, only publishes Python packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/supervisor/). Our packages do not include a configuration file.  Our packages only provide a command, `echo_supervisord_conf`, that prints an example configuration to stdout. The user must save that output to disk and then tailor it to the environment. The [example](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/blob/4.0.3/supervisor/skel/sample.conf) configuration file printed by `echo_supervisord_conf` does not have the `inet_http_server` enabled.  Since the `echo_supervisord_conf` command was introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4 (released in 2008), it has included these lines:  ``` ;[inet_http_server]         ; inet (TCP) server disabled by default ;port=127.0.0.1:9001        ; ip_address:port specifier, *:port for all iface ;username=user              ; default is no username (open server) ;password=123               ; default is no password (open server)  ```  The `inet_http_server` is not enabled unless the user decides to uncomment these lines. The user uncommenting these lines can choose to have it run as an open server by leaving the `username=` and `password=` commented out. It is clearly noted that the defaults are an open server. If authentication is not enabled, this message will be printed at the critical level every time `supervisord` starts:  ``` 2019-05-29 07:22:12,195 CRIT Server 'inet_http_server' running without any HTTP authentication checking  ```  , this is a called a misconfiguration, because some people put this online and anyone can acess, and view logs e restart services therefore I submmit to a CVE, they requered to contact the developer to see if will fix the bug and howmuch time is required needed to do.   * This project, Supervisor, only publishes Python packages to PyPI and those packages do not include a configuration file. * `supervisord` requires a configuration file to start. * Our packages do provide a tool, `echo_supervisord_conf`, that will print an example configuration to stdout. * The example output of `echo_supervisord_conf` does not have the `inet_http_server` enabled. * If the user enables `inet_http_server` but does not enable authentication, a message at the critical level is logged at startup letting them know.   I do not think this should have been a CVE. The ability to run an open server will not be removed because users often use it for local development. However, an [additional warning](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/4e334d9cf2a1daff685893e35e72398437df3dcb) message was added to [the documentation](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#inet-http-server-section-settings).  Note: Supervisor is re-packaged for various distributions. Those packages are created by others who are not involved with the Supervisor project. Those packages may contain changes such as code modifications, init scripts, or included configuration files. We have no way to know what all the various third party packages do with regards to this issue, and only they can change their packages. |

# Configuration File[Â¶](#configuration-file "Permalink to this headline")

The Supervisor configuration file is conventionally named
`supervisord.conf`. It is used by both **supervisord**
and **supervisorctl**. If either application is started
without the `-c` option (the option which is used to tell the
application the configuration filename explicitly), the application
will look for a file named `supervisord.conf` within the
following locations, in the specified order. It will use the first
file it finds.

1. `../etc/supervisord.conf` (Relative to the executable)
2. `../supervisord.conf` (Relative to the executable)
3. `$CWD/supervisord.conf`
4. `$CWD/etc/supervisord.conf`
5. `/etc/supervisord.conf`
6. `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` (since Supervisor 3.3.0)

Note

Many versions of Supervisor packaged for Debian and Ubuntu included a patch
that added `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` to the search paths. The
first PyPI package of Supervisor to include it was Supervisor 3.3.0.

## File Format[Â¶](#file-format "Permalink to this headline")

`supervisord.conf` is a Windows-INI-style (Python ConfigParser)
file. It has sections (each denoted by a `[header]`) and key / value
pairs within the sections. The sections and their allowable values
are described below.

### Environment Variables[Â¶](#environment-variables "Permalink to this headline")

Environment variables that are present in the environment at the time that
**supervisord** is started can be used in the configuration file
using the Python string expression syntax `%(ENV_X)s`:

```
[program:example]
command=/usr/bin/example --loglevel=%(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s

```

In the example above, the expression `%(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s` would be expanded
to the value of the environment variable `LOGLEVEL`.

Note

In Supervisor 3.2 and later, `%(ENV_X)s` expressions are supported in
all options. In prior versions, some options support them, but most
do not. See the documentation for each option below.

## `[unix_http_server]` Section Settings[Â¶](#unix-http-server-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

The `supervisord.conf` file contains a section named
`[unix_http_server]` under which configuration parameters for an
HTTP server that listens on a UNIX domain socket should be inserted.
If the configuration file has no `[unix_http_server]` section, a
UNIX domain socket HTTP server will not be started. The allowable
configuration values are as follows.

### `[unix_http_server]` Section Values[Â¶](#unix-http-server-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`file`

> A path to a UNIX domain socket on which supervisor will listen for
> HTTP/XML-RPC requests. **supervisorctl** uses XML-RPC to
> communicate with **supervisord** over this port. This option
> can include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the directory
> in which the **supervisord** configuration file was found.
>
> *Default*: None.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

Warning

The example configuration output by **echo\_supervisord\_conf** uses
`/tmp/supervisor.sock` as the socket file. That path is an example only
and will likely need to be changed to a location more appropriate for your
system. Some systems periodically delete older files in `/tmp`. If the
socket file is deleted, **supervisorctl** will be unable to
connect to **supervisord**.

`chmod`

> Change the UNIX permission mode bits of the UNIX domain socket to
> this value at startup.
>
> *Default*: `0700`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`chown`

> Change the user and group of the socket file to this value. May be
> a UNIX username (e.g. `chrism`) or a UNIX username and group
> separated by a colon (e.g. `chrism:wheel`).
>
> *Default*: Use the username and group of the user who starts supervisord.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`username`

> The username required for authentication to this HTTP server.
>
> *Default*: No username required.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`password`

> The password required for authentication to this HTTP server. This
> can be a cleartext password, or can be specified as a SHA-1 hash if
> prefixed by the string `{SHA}`. For example,
> `{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d` is the SHA-stored
> version of the password âthepasswordâ.
>
> Note that hashed password must be in hex format.
>
> *Default*: No password required.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

### `[unix_http_server]` Section Example[Â¶](#unix-http-server-section-example "Permalink to this headline")

```
[unix_http_server]
file = /tmp/supervisor.sock
chmod = 0777
chown= nobody:nogroup
username = user
password = 123

```

## `[inet_http_server]` Section Settings[Â¶](#inet-http-server-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

The `supervisord.conf` file contains a section named
`[inet_http_server]` under which configuration parameters for an
HTTP server that listens on a TCP (internet) socket should be
inserted. If the configuration file has no `[inet_http_server]`
section, an inet HTTP server will not be started. The allowable
configuration values are as follows.

Warning

The inet HTTP server is not enabled by default. If you choose to enable it,
please read the following security warning. The inet HTTP server is intended
for use within a trusted environment only. It should only be bound to localhost
or only accessible from within an isolated, trusted network. The inet HTTP server
does not support any form of encryption. The inet HTTP server does not use
authentication by default (see the `username=` and `password=` options).
The inet HTTP server can be controlled remotely from **supervisorctl**.
It also serves a web interface that allows subprocesses to be started or stopped,
and subprocess logs to be viewed. **Never expose the inet HTTP server to the
public internet.**

### `[inet_http_server]` Section Values[Â¶](#inet-http-server-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`port`

> A TCP host:port value or (e.g. `127.0.0.1:9001`) on which
> supervisor will listen for HTTP/XML-RPC requests.
> **supervisorctl** will use XML-RPC to communicate with
> **supervisord** over this port. To listen on all interfaces
> in the machine, use `:9001` or `*:9001`. Please read the security
> warning above.
>
> *Default*: No default.
>
> *Required*: Yes.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`username`

> The username required for authentication to this HTTP server.
>
> *Default*: No username required.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`password`

> The password required for authentication to this HTTP server. This
> can be a cleartext password, or can be specified as a SHA-1 hash if
> prefixed by the string `{SHA}`. For example,
> `{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d` is the SHA-stored
> version of the password âthepasswordâ.
>
> Note that hashed password must be in hex format.
>
> *Default*: No password required.
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

### `[inet_http_server]` Section Example[Â¶](#inet-http-server-section-example "Permalink to this headline")

```
[inet_http_server]

## `[supervisord]` Section Settings[Â¶](#supervisord-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

The `supervisord.conf` file contains a section named
`[supervisord]` in which global settings related to the
**supervisord** process should be inserted. These are as
follows.

### `[supervisord]` Section Values[Â¶](#supervisord-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`logfile`

> The path to the activity log of the supervisord process. This
> option can include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the
> directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.
>
> Note
>
> If `logfile` is set to a special file like `/dev/stdout` that is
> not seekable, log rotation must be disabled by setting
> `logfile_maxbytes = 0`.
>
> *Default*: `$CWD/supervisord.log`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`logfile_maxbytes`

> The maximum number of bytes that may be consumed by the activity log
> file before it is rotated (suffix multipliers like âKBâ, âMBâ, and
> âGBâ can be used in the value). Set this value to 0 to indicate an
> unlimited log size.
>
> *Default*: 50MB
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`logfile_backups`

> The number of backups to keep around resulting from activity log
> file rotation. If set to 0, no backups will be kept.
>
> *Default*: 10
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`loglevel`

> The logging level, dictating what is written to the supervisord
> activity log. One of `critical`, `error`, `warn`, `info`,
> `debug`, `trace`, or `blather`. Note that at log level
> `debug`, the supervisord log file will record the stderr/stdout
> output of its child processes and extended info about process
> state changes, which is useful for debugging a process which isnât
> starting properly. See also: [Activity Log Levels](logging.html#activity-log-levels).
>
> *Default*: info
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`pidfile`

> The location in which supervisord keeps its pid file. This option
> can include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the directory
> in which the supervisord configuration file was found.
>
> *Default*: `$CWD/supervisord.pid`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`umask`

> The [umask](glossary.html#term-umask) of the supervisord process.
>
> *Default*: `022`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`nodaemon`

> If true, supervisord will start in the foreground instead of
> daemonizing.
>
> *Default*: false
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`silent`

> If true and not daemonized, logs will not be directed to stdout.
>
> *Default*: false
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 4.2.0

`minfds`

> The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available before
> supervisord will start successfully. A call to setrlimit will be made
> to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits of the supervisord process to
> satisfy `minfds`. The hard limit may only be raised if supervisord
> is run as root. supervisord uses file descriptors liberally, and will
> enter a failure mode when one cannot be obtained from the OS, so itâs
> useful to be able to specify a minimum value to ensure it doesnât run out
> of them during execution. These limits will be inherited by the managed
> subprocesses. This option is particularly useful on Solaris,
> which has a low per-process fd limit by default.
>
> *Default*: 1024
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`minprocs`

> The minimum number of process descriptors that must be available
> before supervisord will start successfully. A call to setrlimit will be
> made to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits of the supervisord process
> to satisfy `minprocs`. The hard limit may only be raised if supervisord
> is run as root. supervisord will enter a failure mode when the OS runs out
> of process descriptors, so itâs useful to ensure that enough process
> descriptors are available upon **supervisord** startup.
>
> *Default*: 200
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`nocleanup`

> Prevent supervisord from clearing any existing `AUTO`
> child log files at startup time. Useful for debugging.
>
> *Default*: false
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`childlogdir`

> The directory used for `AUTO` child log files. This option can
> include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the directory in
> which the **supervisord** configuration file was found.
>
> *Default*: value of Pythonâs `tempfile.gettempdir()`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`user`

> Instruct **supervisord** to switch users to this UNIX user
> account before doing any meaningful processing. The user can only
> be switched if **supervisord** is started as the root user.
>
> *Default*: do not switch users
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0
>
> *Changed*: 3.3.4. If **supervisord** canât switch to the
> specified user, it will write an error message to `stderr` and
> then exit immediately. In earlier versions, it would continue to
> run but would log a message at the `critical` level.

`directory`

> When **supervisord** daemonizes, switch to this directory.
> This option can include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the
> directory in which the **supervisord** configuration file was
> found.
>
> *Default*: do not cd
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`strip_ansi`

> Strip all ANSI escape sequences from child log files.
>
> *Default*: false
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`environment`

> A list of key/value pairs in the form `KEY="val",KEY2="val2"` that
> will be placed in the environment of all child processes. This does
> not change the environment of **supervisord** itself. This
> option can include the value `%(here)s`, which expands to the
> directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.
> Values containing non-alphanumeric characters should be quoted
> (e.g. `KEY="val:123",KEY2="val,456"`). Otherwise, quoting the
> values is optional but recommended. To escape percent characters,
> simply use two. (e.g. `URI="/first%%20name"`) **Note** that
> subprocesses will inherit the environment variables of the shell
> used to start **supervisord** except for the ones overridden
> here and within the programâs `environment` option. See
> [Subprocess Environment](subprocess.html#subprocess-environment).
>
> *Default*: no values
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`identifier`

> The identifier string for this supervisor process, used by the RPC
> interface.
>
> *Default*: supervisor
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

```

## `[program:x]` Section Settings[Â¶](#program-x-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

The configuration file must contain one or more `program` sections
in order for supervisord to know which programs it should start and
control. The header value is composite value. It is the word
âprogramâ, followed directly by a colon, then the program name. A
header value of `[program:foo]` describes a program with the name of
âfooâ. The name is used within client applications that control the
processes that are created as a result of this configuration. It is
an error to create a `program` section that does not have a name.
The name must not include a colon character or a bracket character.
The value of the name is used as the value for the
`%(program_name)s` string expression expansion within other values
where specified.

Note

A `[program:x]` section actually represents a âhomogeneous
process groupâ to supervisor (as of 3.0). The members of the group
are defined by the combination of the `numprocs` and
`process_name` parameters in the configuration. By default, if
numprocs and process\_name are left unchanged from their defaults,
the group represented by `[program:x]` will be named `x` and
will have a single process named `x` in it. This provides a
modicum of backwards compatibility with older supervisor releases,
which did not treat program sections as homogeneous process group
definitions.

But for instance, if you have a `[program:foo]` section with a
`numprocs` of 3 and a `process_name` expression of
`%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d`, the âfooâ group will
contain three processes, named `foo_00`, `foo_01`, and
`foo_02`. This makes it possible to start a number of very
similar processes using a single `[program:x]` section. All
logfile names, all environment strings, and the command of programs
can also contain similar Python string expressions, to pass
slightly different parameters to each process.

### `[program:x]` Section Values[Â¶](#program-x-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`command`

> The command that will be run when this program is started. The
> command can be either absolute (e.g. `/path/to/programname`) or
> relative (e.g. `programname`). If it is relative, the
> supervisordâs environment `$PATH` will be searched for the
> executable. Programs can accept arguments, e.g. `/path/to/program
> foo bar`. The command line can use double quotes to group
> arguments with spaces in them to pass to the program,
> e.g. `/path/to/program/name -p "foo bar"`. Note that the value of
> `command` may include Python string expressions,
> e.g. `/path/to/programname --port=80%(process_num)02d` might
> expand to `/path/to/programname --port=8000` at runtime. String
> expressions are evaluated against a dictionary containing the keys
> `group_name`, `host_node_name`, `program_name`, `process_num`,
> `numprocs`, `here` (the directory of the supervisord config file),
> and all supervisordâs environment variables prefixed with `ENV_`.
> Controlled programs should themselves not be daemons, as supervisord
> assumes it is responsible for daemonizing its subprocesses (see
> [Nondaemonizing of Subprocesses](subprocess.html#nondaemonizing-of-subprocesses)).
>
> Note
>
> The command will be truncated if it looks like a config file comment,
> e.g. `command=bash -c 'foo ; bar'` will be truncated to
> `command=bash -c 'foo`. Quoting will not prevent this behavior,
> since the configuration file reader does not parse the command like
> a shell would.
>
> *Default*: No default.
>
> *Required*: Yes.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0
>
> *Changed*: 4.2.0. Added support for the `numprocs` expansion.

`process_name`

> A Python string expression that is used to compose the supervisor
> process name for this process. You usually donât need to worry
> about setting this unless you change `numprocs`. The string
> expression is evaluated against a dictionary that includes
> `group_name`, `host_node_name`, `process_num`, `program_name`,
> and `here` (the directory of the supervisord config file).
>
> *Default*: `%(program_name)s`
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`numprocs`

> Supervisor will start as many instances of this program as named by
> numprocs. Note that if numprocs > 1, the `process_name`
> expression must include `%(process_num)s` (or any other
> valid Python string expression that includes `process_num`) within
> it.
>
> *Default*: 1
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`numprocs_start`

> An integer offset that is used to compute the number at which
> `process_num` starts.
>
> *Default*: 0
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`priority`

> The relative priority of the program in the start and shutdown
> ordering. Lower priorities indicate programs that start first and
> shut down last at startup and when aggregate commands are used in
> various clients (e.g. âstart allâ/âstop allâ). Higher priorities
> indicate programs that start last and shut down first.
>
> *Default*: 999
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`autostart`

> If true, this program will start automatically when supervisord is
> started.
>
> *Default*: true
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`startsecs`

> The total number of seconds which the program needs to stay running
> after a startup to consider the start successful (moving the process
> from the `STARTING` state to the `RUNNING` state). Set to `0`
> to indicate that the program neednât stay running for any particular
> amount of time.
>
> Note
>
> Even if a process exits with an âexpectedâ exit code (see
> `exitcodes`), the start will still be considered a failure
> if the process exits quicker than `startsecs`.
>
> *Default*: 1
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`startretries`

> The number of serial failure attempts that **supervisord**
> will allow when attempting to start the program before giving up and
> putting the process into an `FATAL` state.
>
> Note
>
> After each failed restart, process will be put in `BACKOFF` state
> and each retry attempt will take increasingly more time.
>
> See [Process States](subprocess.html#process-states) for explanation of the `FATAL` and
> `BACKOFF` states.
>
> *Default*: 3
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`autorestart`

> Specifies if **supervisord** should automatically restart a
> process if it exits when it is in the `RUNNING` state. May be
> one of `false`, `unexpected`, or `true`. If `false`, the
> process will not be autorestarted. If `unexpected`, the process
> will be restarted when the program exits with an exit code that is
> not one of the exit codes associated with this processâ configuration
> (see `exitcodes`). If `true`, the process will be unconditionally
> restarted when it exits, without regard to its exit code.
>
> Note
>
> `autorestart` controls whether **supervisord** will
> autorestart a program if it exits after it has successfully started
> up (the process is in the `RUNNING` state).
>
> **supervisord** has a different restart mechanism for when the
> process is starting up (the process is in the `STARTING` state).
> Retries during process startup are controlled by `startsecs`
> and `startretries`.
>
> *Default*: unexpected
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`exitcodes`

> The list of âexpectedâ exit codes for this program used with `autorestart`.
> If the `autorestart` parameter is set to `unexpected`, and the process
> exits in any other way than as a result of a supervisor stop
> request, **supervisord** will restart the process if it exits
> with an exit code that is not defined in this list.
>
> *Default*: 0
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0
>
> Note
>
> In Supervisor versions prior to 4.0, the default was `0,2`. In
> Supervisor 4.0, the default was changed to `0`.

`stopsignal`

> The signal used to kill the program when a stop is requested. This can be
> specified using the signalâs name or its number. It is normally one of:
> `TERM`, `HUP`, `INT`, `QUIT`, `KILL`, `USR1`, or `USR2`.
>
> *Default*: TERM
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`stopwaitsecs`

> The number of seconds to wait for the OS to return a SIGCHLD to
> **supervisord** after the program has been sent a stopsignal.
> If this number of seconds elapses before **supervisord**
> receives a SIGCHLD from the process, **supervisord** will
> attempt to kill it with a final SIGKILL.
>
> *Default*: 10
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`stopasgroup`

> If true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the
> whole process group and implies `killasgroup` is true. This is useful
> for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate
> stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.
>
> *Default*: false
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0b1

`killasgroup`

> If true, when resorting to send SIGKILL to the program to terminate

`user`

> Instruct **supervisord** to use this UNIX user account as the
> account which runs the program. The user can only be switched if
> **supervisord** is run as the root user. If **supervisord**
> canât switch to the specified user, the program will not be started.

`redirect_stderr`

> If true, cause the processâ stderr output to be sent back to
> **supervisord** on its stdout file descriptor (in UNIX shell
> terms, this is the equivalent of executing `/the/program 2>&1`).
>
> Note
>
> Do not set `redirect_stderr=true` in an `[eventlistener:x]` section.
> Eventlisteners use `stdout` and `stdin` to communicate with

## `[include]` Section Settings[Â¶](#include-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

The `supervisord.conf` file may contain a section named
`[include]`. If the configuration file contains an `[include]`
section, it must contain a single key named âfilesâ. The values in
this key specify other configuration files to be included within the
configuration.

Note

The `[include]` section is processed only by `supervisord`. It is
ignored by `supervisorctl`.

### `[include]` Section Values[Â¶](#include-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`files`

> A space-separated sequence of file globs. Each file glob may be
> absolute or relative. If the file glob is relative, it is
> considered relative to the location of the configuration file which
> includes it. A âglobâ is a file pattern which matches a specified
> pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell. No tilde
> expansion is done, but `*`, `?`, and character ranges expressed
> with `[]` will be correctly matched. The string expression is
> evaluated against a dictionary that includes `host_node_name`
> and `here` (the directory of the supervisord config file). Recursive
> includes from included files are not supported.
>
> *Default*: No default (required)
>
> *Required*: Yes.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0
>
> *Changed*: 3.3.0. Added support for the `host_node_name` expansion.

### `[include]` Section Example[Â¶](#include-section-example "Permalink to this headline")

```
[include]
files = /an/absolute/filename.conf /an/absolute/*.conf foo.conf config??.conf

```

## `[group:x]` Section Settings[Â¶](#group-x-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

It is often useful to group âhomogeneousâ process groups (aka
âprogramsâ) together into a âheterogeneousâ process group so they can
be controlled as a unit from Supervisorâs various controller
interfaces.

To place programs into a group so you can treat them as a unit, define
a `[group:x]` section in your configuration file. The group header
value is a composite. It is the word âgroupâ, followed directly by a
colon, then the group name. A header value of `[group:foo]`
describes a group with the name of âfooâ. The name is used within
client applications that control the processes that are created as a
result of this configuration. It is an error to create a `group`
section that does not have a name. The name must not include a colon
character or a bracket character.

For a `[group:x]`, there must be one or more `[program:x]`
sections elsewhere in your configuration file, and the group must
refer to them by name in the `programs` value.

If âhomogeneousâ process groups (represented by program sections) are
placed into a âheterogeneousâ group via `[group:x]` sectionâs
`programs` line, the homogeneous groups that are implied by the
program section will not exist at runtime in supervisor. Instead, all
processes belonging to each of the homogeneous groups will be placed
into the heterogeneous group. For example, given the following group
configuration:

```
[group:foo]
programs=bar,baz
priority=999

```

Given the above, at supervisord startup, the `bar` and `baz`
homogeneous groups will not exist, and the processes that would have
been under them will now be moved into the `foo` group.

### `[group:x]` Section Values[Â¶](#group-x-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

> A comma-separated list of program names. The programs which are
> listed become members of the group.

## `[fcgi-program:x]` Section Settings[Â¶](#fcgi-program-x-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

Supervisor can manage groups of [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com)
processes that all listen on the same socket. Until now, deployment
flexibility for FastCGI was limited. To get full process management,
you could use mod\_fastcgi under Apache but then you were stuck with
Apacheâs inefficient concurrency model of one process or thread per
connection. In addition to requiring more CPU and memory resources,
the process/thread per connection model can be quickly saturated by a
slow resource, preventing other resources from being served. In order
to take advantage of newer event-driven web servers such as lighttpd
or nginx which donât include a built-in process manager, you had to
use scripts like cgi-fcgi or spawn-fcgi. These can be used in
conjunction with a process manager such as supervisord or daemontools
but require each FastCGI child process to bind to its own socket.
The disadvantages of this are: unnecessarily complicated web server
configuration, ungraceful restarts, and reduced fault tolerance. With
fewer sockets to configure, web server configurations are much smaller
if groups of FastCGI processes can share sockets. Shared sockets
allow for graceful restarts because the socket remains bound by the
parent process while any of the child processes are being restarted.
Finally, shared sockets are more fault tolerant because if a given
process fails, other processes can continue to serve inbound
connections.

With integrated FastCGI spawning support, Supervisor gives you the
best of both worlds. You get full-featured process management with
groups of FastCGI processes sharing sockets without being tied to a
particular web server. Itâs a clean separation of concerns, allowing
the web server and the process manager to each do what they do best.

Note

The socket manager in Supervisor was originally developed to support
FastCGI processes but it is not limited to FastCGI. Other protocols may
be used as well with no special configuration. Any program that can
access an open socket from a file descriptor (e.g. with
[socket.fromfd](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html#socket.fromfd)
in Python) can use the socket manager. Supervisor will automatically
create the socket, bind, and listen before forking the first child in a
group. The socket will be passed to each child on file descriptor
number `0` (zero). When the last child in the group exits,
Supervisor will close the socket.

Note

Prior to Supervisor 3.4.0, FastCGI programs (`[fcgi-program:x]`)
could not be referenced in groups (`[group:x]`).

All the options available to `[program:x]` sections are
also respected by `fcgi-program` sections.

### `[fcgi-program:x]` Section Values[Â¶](#fcgi-program-x-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`[fcgi-program:x]` sections have a few keys which `[program:x]`
sections do not have.

`socket`

> The FastCGI socket for this program, either TCP or UNIX domain
> socket. For TCP sockets, use this format: `tcp://localhost:9002`.
> For UNIX domain sockets, use `unix:///absolute/path/to/file.sock`.
> String expressions are evaluated against a dictionary containing the
> keys âprogram\_nameâ and âhereâ (the directory of the supervisord
> config file).
>
> *Default*: No default.
>
> *Required*: Yes.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

`socket_backlog`

> Sets socket listen(2) backlog.
>
> *Default*: socket.SOMAXCONN
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.4.0

`socket_owner`

> For UNIX domain sockets, this parameter can be used to specify the user
> and group for the FastCGI socket. May be a UNIX username (e.g. chrism)
> or a UNIX username and group separated by a colon (e.g. chrism:wheel).
>
> *Default*: Uses the user and group set for the fcgi-program
>
> *Required*: No.

> For UNIX domain sockets, this parameter can be used to specify the
> permission mode.
>

## `[eventlistener:x]` Section Settings[Â¶](#eventlistener-x-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

Supervisor allows specialized homogeneous process groups (âevent
listener poolsâ) to be defined within the configuration file. These
pools contain processes that are meant to receive and respond to event
notifications from supervisorâs event system. See [Events](events.html#events) for
an explanation of how events work and how to implement programs that
can be declared as event listeners.

Note that all the options available to `[program:x]` sections are
respected by eventlistener sections *except* for `stdout_capture_maxbytes`.
Eventlisteners cannot emit process communication events on `stdout`,
but can emit on `stderr` (see [Capture Mode](logging.html#capture-mode)).

### `[eventlistener:x]` Section Values[Â¶](#eventlistener-x-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`[eventlistener:x]` sections have a few keys which `[program:x]`
sections do not have.

`buffer_size`

> The event listener poolâs event queue buffer size. When a listener
> poolâs event buffer is overflowed (as can happen when an event
> listener pool cannot keep up with all of the events sent to it), the
> oldest event in the buffer is discarded.

`events`

> A comma-separated list of event type names that this listener is
> âinterestedâ in receiving notifications for (see
> [Event Types](events.html#event-types) for a list of valid event type names).

`result_handler`

> A [pkg\_resources entry point string](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PkgResources) that
> resolves to a Python callable. The default value is
> `supervisor.dispatchers:default_handler`. Specifying an alternate
> result handler is a very uncommon thing to need to do, and as a
> result, how to create one is not documented.

above constraints and additions.

## `[rpcinterface:x]` Section Settings[Â¶](#rpcinterface-x-section-settings "Permalink to this headline")

Adding `rpcinterface:x` settings in the configuration file is only
useful for people who wish to extend supervisor with additional custom
behavior.

In the sample config file (see [Creating a Configuration File](installing.html#create-config)), there is a section
which is named `[rpcinterface:supervisor]`. By default it looks like the
following.

```
[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

```

The `[rpcinterface:supervisor]` section *must* remain in the
configuration for the standard setup of supervisor to work properly.
If you donât want supervisor to do anything it doesnât already do out
of the box, this is all you need to know about this type of section.

However, if you wish to add rpc interface namespaces in order to
customize supervisor, you may add additional `[rpcinterface:foo]`
sections, where âfooâ represents the namespace of the interface (from
the web root), and the value named by
`supervisor.rpcinterface_factory` is a factory callable which should
have a function signature that accepts a single positional argument
`supervisord` and as many keyword arguments as required to perform
configuration. Any extra key/value pairs defined within the
`[rpcinterface:x]` section will be passed as keyword arguments to
the factory.

Hereâs an example of a factory function, created in the
`__init__.py` file of the Python package `my.package`.

```
from my.package.rpcinterface import AnotherRPCInterface

def make_another_rpcinterface(supervisord, **config):
    retries = int(config.get('retries', 0))
    another_rpc_interface = AnotherRPCInterface(supervisord, retries)
    return another_rpc_interface

```

And a section in the config file meant to configure it.

```
[rpcinterface:another]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = my.package:make_another_rpcinterface
retries = 1

```

### `[rpcinterface:x]` Section Values[Â¶](#rpcinterface-x-section-values "Permalink to this headline")

`supervisor.rpcinterface_factory`

> `pkg_resources` âentry pointâ dotted name to your RPC interfaceâs
> factory function.
>
> *Default*: N/A
>
> *Required*: No.
>
> *Introduced*: 3.0

### `[rpcinterface:x]` Section Example[Â¶](#rpcinterface-x-section-example "Permalink to this headline")

```
[rpcinterface:another]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = my.package:make_another_rpcinterface
retries = 1

```
