| So, I was search for vulnerabites in my work company and I founded supervisord, it's a good service but the user don't need authetication for view logs ou restart a service  Supervisor requires that a configuration file be created before `supervisord` can be started. It will not start without one. This project, Supervisor, only publishes Python packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/supervisor/). Our packages do not include a configuration file.  Our packages only provide a command, `echo_supervisord_conf`, that prints an example configuration to stdout. The user must save that output to disk and then tailor it to the environment. The [example](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/blob/4.0.3/supervisor/skel/sample.conf) configuration file printed by `echo_supervisord_conf` does not have the `inet_http_server` enabled.  Since the `echo_supervisord_conf` command was introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4 (released in 2008), it has included these lines:  ``` ;[inet_http_server]         ; inet (TCP) server disabled by default ;port=127.0.0.1:9001        ; ip_address:port specifier, *:port for all iface ;username=user              ; default is no username (open server) ;password=123               ; default is no password (open server)  ```  The `inet_http_server` is not enabled unless the user decides to uncomment these lines. The user uncommenting these lines can choose to have it run as an open server by leaving the `username=` and `password=` commented out. It is clearly noted that the defaults are an open server. If authentication is not enabled, this message will be printed at the critical level every time `supervisord` starts:  ``` 2019-05-29 07:22:12,195 CRIT Server 'inet_http_server' running without any HTTP authentication checking  ```  , this is a called a misconfiguration, because some people put this online and anyone can acess, and view logs e restart services therefore I submmit to a CVE, they requered to contact the developer to see if will fix the bug and howmuch time is required needed to do.   * This project, Supervisor, only publishes Python packages to PyPI and those packages do not include a configuration file. * `supervisord` requires a configuration file to start. * Our packages do provide a tool, `echo_supervisord_conf`, that will print an example configuration to stdout. * The example output of `echo_supervisord_conf` does not have the `inet_http_server` enabled. * If the user enables `inet_http_server` but does not enable authentication, a message at the critical level is logged at startup letting them know.   I do not think this should have been a CVE. The ability to run an open server will not be removed because users often use it for local development. However, an [additional warning](https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/4e334d9cf2a1daff685893e35e72398437df3dcb) message was added to [the documentation](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#inet-http-server-section-settings).  Note: Supervisor is re-packaged for various distributions. Those packages are created by others who are not involved with the Supervisor project. Those packages may contain changes such as code modifications, init scripts, or included configuration files. We have no way to know what all the various third party packages do with regards to this issue, and only they can change their packages. |
