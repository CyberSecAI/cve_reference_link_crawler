{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was attempting to copy 6 bytes of data into a 1-byte member of the wrong structure using memcpy. This caused a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect memcpy destination. The `ngene_command_config_free_buf` function was using `&com.cmd.ConfigureBuffers.config` as the destination, which has a size of 1 byte, instead of `&com.cmd.ConfigureFreeBuffers.config`, which has 6 bytes.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The memcpy() operation would overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a system crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability lies in the `ngene_command_config_free_buf` function which handles the configuration of free buffers. An attacker could trigger the vulnerable code path by sending a crafted command to the ngene driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the ngene driver, for example, by having local access or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to interact with the driver."
