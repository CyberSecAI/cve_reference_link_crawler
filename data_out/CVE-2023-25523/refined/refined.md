- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `nvdisasm` binary file within the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. This is triggered by processing a malformed ELF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a partial denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a user with a malformed ELF file which is then processed by `nvdisasm`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malformed ELF file, and the user needs to run `nvdisasm` with the file as input. This suggests a local attack with the user needing to open the malicious file, since the AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R vector includes user interaction.
