- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the interaction between the TCP Intercept feature and the Snort 3 detection engine when handling embryonic (half-open) TCP connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of embryonic TCP connections, leading to a bypass of configured policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device, bypassing security policies.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted traffic pattern through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
