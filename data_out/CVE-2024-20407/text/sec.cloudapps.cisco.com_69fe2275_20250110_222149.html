Devices that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected by this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is due to a logic error when handling embryonic (half-open) TCP connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted traffic pattern through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-bypass-PTry37fX>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products    At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FTD Software and Cisco FirePOWER Services if they were configured with a maximum embryonic connection using the Snort 3 detection engine.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Snort Configuration on Cisco FTD Software To determine if Snort 3 is running on Cisco FTD Software, see [Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that.html). Snort 3 has to be active for this vulnerability to be exploited. Determine the Embryonic Configuration on Cisco FTD Software The default value for embryonic connections is 0, which is unlimited connections. Deployments with the default configuration are considered not vulnerable.  To determine the embryonic connection configuration, use the **show running-config policy-map | include embryonic** FTD CLI command. The following example shows the output of the command on a device that has a maximum embryonic connection set:  ```   FTD# show running-config policy-map | include embryonic  set connection conn-max 1000 embryonic-conn-max 3000FTD#   ```  If the command shows no output, the device is considered not vulnerable.  For more information on embryonic connections, see the [Protect Servers from a SYN Flood DoS Attack (TCP Intercept)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/630/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v63/threat_defense_service_policies.html#id_71090) section or the [What Are Connection Settings?](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/secure-firewall/management-center/device-config/720/management-center-device-config-72/access-service-policies.html#ID-2068-00000008) section of of the *Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center Device Configuration Guide*. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software   + Open Source Snort 2   + Open Source Snort 3  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. To implement the workaround, turn off pkt-decode-optimization using the **no asp inspect-dp pkt-decode-optimization** FTD CLI command, as shown in the following example:  ```   FTD# no asp inspect-dp pkt-decode-optimizationFTD#   ```  While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5. Click **Check**.
