Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `hasGrantedPolicyAdd` function within the Android framework. Specifically, when a component name is specified, the function fails to verify if the component actually belongs to the caller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation to ensure that the specified component name belongs to the calling application. This allows a malicious application to potentially manipulate or interact with components it shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure issue. While not explicitly stated, the missing validation could potentially allow a malicious app to gain access to policy information or metadata related to other apps or system components, which it normally wouldn't be authorized to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application could exploit the missing check in `hasGrantedPolicyAdd` by providing a component name that doesn't belong to it, potentially gaining access to policy information associated with that other component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the target device.
- The attacker application needs to target and call the vulnerable `hasGrantedPolicyAdd` function with a crafted component name to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in AOSP version 12.
- The commit message indicates that the fix is a "cherry pick", which means it was backported from a more recent version of code to address the issue.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-0986 is a moderate severity information disclosure vulnerability due to a missing validation check within the Android framework. This can potentially allow a malicious application to gain access to sensitive policy information.
