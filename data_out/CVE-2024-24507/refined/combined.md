CVE-2024-24507 Vulnerability Details

 [Raw](/Xandsz/2b409acb81e846fc3478600f984785a1/raw/23bb3ee9b84ef6abeca45d4daf8d3a2b536f152b/CVE-2024-24507.md)

[**CVE-2024-24507.md**](#file-cve-2024-24507-md)

**CVE-2024-24507: XSS in Act-On Login Page**

**Description:**
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in Act-On version 2023. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser context, which can lead to the theft of sensitive information such as session cookies.

**Affected Product:**

* Product Name: Act-On
* Version: 2023

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper input validation in the `newUser` parameter of the `acton/account/login.jsp` page. Below is an example payload that exploits this vulnerability:

Vulnerable URL:

<https://www.example.com/acton/account/login.jsp?newUser=xxx></script><svg/onload=alert(%27xandsz%27)>

When the above payload is inserted, it results in the execution of the embedded JavaScript, displaying an alert with the message "xandsz".

**Solution:**
Users are advised to update to a patched version of Act-On or implement the following mitigation:

* Properly validate and sanitize user input to prevent the inclusion of malicious scripts.
* Use defense mechanisms such as Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the execution of untrusted scripts.

**Author:**
Discovered by Alexandre Rodrigo Da Silva
