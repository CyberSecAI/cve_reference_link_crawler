Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27730:

**CVE-2024-27730: Access control, insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue in calendar event feature.**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks when creating and editing calendar events. Specifically, the `cid` (contact ID) parameter, which determines the user associated with the event, can be manipulated by an attacker.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system relies on the `cid` parameter, which can be directly modified by an attacker to impersonate other users.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not verify if the user making the request is authorized to create or modify events on behalf of the specified `cid`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Event Creation Impersonation:** An attacker can create calendar events as any other user on the Friendica server.
    *   **Combined with XSS:** When combined with the stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2024-27729) in the calendar event feature, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into events created on behalf of other users. This would allow the attacker to steal session cookies or password hashes of targeted users when they view the manipulated events.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:**  An attacker can directly modify the `cid` parameter in the `/calendar/api/create` POST request.
    *   **Event Edit:** Attackers can create an event with their own user ID, then modify that event to be associated with another user (by setting the `cid` to `0`), causing it to be shared on the victim's feed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Friendica instance.
    *   The attacker needs to know the contact ID (`cid`) of the target user. However this is typically sequential.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Friendica server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

* The provided content explains in detail how this vulnerability can be exploited.
* It clarifies that while creating an event with a different user's CID does not share it by default, editing the event with cid=0 triggers sharing.
* This IDOR vulnerability, in combination with stored XSS, allows for a more severe attack targeting any user on the server, not just the attacker's followers.
* The fix involved preventing overwriting the `cid` during event edits.
