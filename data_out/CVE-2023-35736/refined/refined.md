Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the DDP (D-Link Discovery Protocol) service of the D-Link DAP-2622 device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. The DDP service doesn't check the size of the input data before writing it to a buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to write past the boundaries of the buffer.
*   **Missing Authentication (in some cases):** For the specific vulnerability described in the ZDI advisory (ZDI-CAN-20063/CVE-2023-35736), authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Multiple Vulnerable Endpoints:** The advisory and D-Link's support announcement details numerous other stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the DDP service, affecting various functions, such as user verification, reboot, reset, configuration backup/restore, firmware upgrade, and others. Most of these require authentication but can still be exploited by an attacker with valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflows allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges. This gives the attacker full control over the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Adjacent:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, meaning that the attack vector is "adjacent".
*   **DDP Service:** The vulnerabilities are within the DDP service, which is likely listening on a specific network port. The specific network port is not mentioned in the provided text.
*   **Malicious crafted requests:** The attack involves sending specially crafted requests to the DDP service containing an overly long value for the "new password" when changing the device ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate directly with the DDP service on the network.
*   **Technical Expertise:**  Exploitation of this type of vulnerability requires technical knowledge to create the malicious payloads.

**Specifics of CVE-2023-35736:**

*   This CVE is specifically associated with the **DDP Change ID Password New Password Stack-based Buffer Overflow** vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-20063).
*   It's important to note that the vulnerability **does not require authentication** to exploit.

In summary, the D-Link DAP-2622 device is vulnerable to a variety of stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities within its DDP service, with the specific vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-35736 allowing for remote, unauthenticated code execution as root.
