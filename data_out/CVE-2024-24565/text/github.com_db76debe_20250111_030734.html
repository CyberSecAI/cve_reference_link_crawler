# CrateDB database has an arbitrary file read vulnerability

Moderate

GHSA-475g-vj6c-xf96
Jan 30, 2024

## Package

actions

https://github.com/crate/crate
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

<=5.3.8, <=5.4.7, <=5.5.3, 5.6.0

## Patched versions

5.3.9, 5.4.8, 5.5.4, 5.6.1

## Description

### Summary

There is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the CrateDB database, and authenticated CrateDB database users can read any file on the system.

### Details

There is a COPY FROM function in the CrateDB database that is used to import file data into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can use the COPY FROM function to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage.

### PoC

```
CREATE TABLE info_leak(info_leak STRING);
COPY info_leak FROM '/etc/passwd' with (format='csv', header=false); or COPY info_leak FROM '/crate/config/crate.yml' with (format='csv', header=false);
SELECT * FROM info_leak;

```

### Impact

This vulnerability affects all current versions of the CrateDB database. Attackers who exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information may carry out further attacks, while also affecting CrateDB Cloud Clusters.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
