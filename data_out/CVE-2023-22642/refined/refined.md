- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper certificate validation during the establishment of secure connections with FortiGuard servers. Specifically, when FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager download outbreakalert resources, the client (FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager) fails to properly validate the server-side certificate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Lack of client-side certificate validation (CWE-295)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote and unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. This can allow the attacker to intercept and manipulate the communication channel, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands on the affected FortiAnalyzer or FortiManager device.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-based attack where an attacker intercepts the communication between the FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager device and the FortiGuard server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable device and the FortiGuard server, allowing them to perform a MitM attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
