## (0Day) Maxon Cinema 4D SKP File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-1188ZDI-CAN-21432

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-40484](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40484) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Maxon](https://www.maxon.net/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Maxon Cinema 4D. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | 06/15/23 – ZDI requested a vendor PSIRT contact.  07/12/23 – ZDI made another attempt to contact the vendor.  08/17/23 – ZDI attempted to contact the vendor once more using the contact information on their website, as well as trying to reach them on various social platforms.  -- Mitigation: Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application. |
