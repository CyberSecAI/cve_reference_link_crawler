Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of the `EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT` flag in the Btrfs filesystem when dealing with zoned block devices. The `btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty()` function was setting this flag on extent buffers even when the buffer was under I/O (WRITEBACK flag set) and not marked as DIRTY. This would cause the buffer's content to be cleared before the bio submission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect flag setting:** The `EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT` flag was being set inappropriately on buffers under I/O that were not marked dirty.
*   **Premature data clearing:** The content of the extent buffer was being cleared prematurely due to the incorrect flag setting, leading to data corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **File System Corruption:** The incorrect clearing of the buffer's content could lead to the addition of faulty delayed reference items, resulting in a file system corrupted error (EUCLEAN). This could manifest during delayed reference updates.
*   **On-disk data corruption:** Although less likely, clearing a tree node can lead to on disk data corruption, although this node would be invalidated in the next transaction commit.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the normal operation of the Btrfs file system when a buffer is cleaned up by `btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty()` while under I/O and not marked as DIRTY on a zoned block device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need any specific capabilities or position to trigger this vulnerability. It occurs through normal file system operation.
*   The attacker needs to be using a Btrfs filesystem on a zoned block device.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Btrfs filesystems running on zoned block devices.
*   The fix ensures the `EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT` flag is set only when the `EXTENT_BUFFER_DIRTY` flag is also set.
* The provided patches are the same and fix the issue by adding a check to ensure the buffer is marked as dirty before setting the ZEROOUT flag.
