**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Page Builder: Pagelayer – Drag and Drop website builder plugin when handling custom attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker with contributor-level permissions or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
- Cookie theft
- Data exfiltration
- Malicious redirects
- Defacement
- Session hijacking

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker leverages the plugin's custom attribute handling to inject malicious scripts.
- The attack is launched via the WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least "contributor" level permissions or higher.
- The attacker needs the ability to access and edit content via the plugin’s interface.
