- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A service name containing HTML tags was not properly encoded, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) in graph rendering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting HTML tags into a service name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to set or modify service names to inject malicious HTML tags. This would likely require authenticated access with specific privileges. The CVSS vector indicates that user interaction (UI:R) is required.
