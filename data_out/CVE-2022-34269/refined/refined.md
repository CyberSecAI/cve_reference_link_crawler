Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-34269:

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Root Cause:** The `com.idiominc.ws.servlet.LoadDTD` class at `/ws-legacy/load_dtd` allows authenticated users to make arbitrary GET requests to internal or external hosts via the `system_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SSRF:** The application fetches resources from arbitrary URLs specified in the `system_id` parameter without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to make requests on behalf of the server, but the response is not directly returned to the attacker (hence, "blind").
*   **Lack of Authentication for Internal Services:** The Apache Axis AdminService on the local host does not require authentication when accessed locally.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the SSRF vulnerability, an attacker can send a request to the local Apache Axis AdminService, which allows deployment of new web services. Using this, the attacker can deploy a JSP webshell or use a JNDI injection technique to achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attacker must have network access to the WorldServer application.
*   **HTTP Request:** A crafted HTTP GET request is sent to `/ws-legacy/load_dtd` with a malicious `system_id` parameter containing a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, but a low-privileged user account is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WorldServer application.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Services:** The attacker needs to know the address of the internal Apache Axis AdminService.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is in the `com.idiominc.ws.servlet.LoadDTD` class.
*   The `system_id` parameter in the request is used to construct an XML document that is then parsed.
*   The parsing process uses an XML resolver which fetches the external resource specified by `system_id`.
*   The attacker can exploit this to trigger requests to other internal services running on the same server, specifically the Apache Axis AdminService.
*   The exploitation technique using JNDI injection with the org.apache.axis.client.ServiceFactory class to achieve RCE is mentioned.
*   The exploit can be performed by sending a request to the local Apache Axis AdminService with a specially crafted XML payload as the `system_id`, deploying a new webservice (ServiceFactoryService), then calling the created webservice with a JNDI lookup to an attacker controlled LDAP server to achieve remote code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in WorldServer versions 11.7.2.243 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 11.7.3.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Triskele Labs.
