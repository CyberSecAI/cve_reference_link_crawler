> Bricks has solved all the problems I've had with any other WP builders I've tried. Excellent performance (both front and back end), really easy to use, a UI that hugely inspires me to design, a solid theme styling system, the ability to create any extended global styles I can think of, and native features that other tools require 3rd party plugins for.

> I’ve used every page builder for WordPress. I’ve recorded hundreds of hours of training videos teaching web design best practices with page builders. I’ve built sites for clients from $5k to $125k. I can say, with confidence, that Bricks Builder is #1 in the WordPress ecosystem right now. There’s no better option for building clean, scalable, maintainable, accessible websites. Buy it without hesitation.

> After years of working with Elementor and Visual Composer, I decided to switch to Bricks. Performance and simplicity were key aspects to improve on my websites, and Bricks has definitely given me what I was after. Thanks to Bricks, my SEO efforts don´t get obscured by tons of lines of code that don´t do anything to my website but slow it down.

> What I love the most about Bricks is the query loop builder. It's rich in features and has the capability of querying taxonomies, and paired with Bricks dynamic data tags, it pushes the limits of what you can do with dynamic data.

> Bricks fills the gap between dumbed-down, heavy, visual builders vs writing clean code from scratch. With Bricks I feel I have all the power of controlling my own clean CSS code, while having UI windows to organize it all visually.
