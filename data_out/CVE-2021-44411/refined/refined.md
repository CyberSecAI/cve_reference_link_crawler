- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` process, which manages API requests, incorrectly assumes that the `param` JSON element within a command is always a JSON object. When a string or other non-object type is provided for `param`, the code attempts to use the subscription operator which asserts and terminates the process, leading to a device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. The JSON parser does not correctly validate the type of the `param` field within a JSON command, leading to an assertion and denial of service when a non-object type is provided.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit leads to a denial of service, specifically a reboot of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint of the Reolink RLC-410W device with a JSON payload in the body. The JSON payload must contain a command with a `param` field that is not a JSON object (e.g., an empty string).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device. While most of these vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, TALOS-2021-1420 can be exploited to bypass authentication, making it possible to trigger this issue without credentials.
