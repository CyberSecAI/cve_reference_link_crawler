- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of a file when read from system flash memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper file validation when reading from system flash memory. This vulnerability exists in a legacy capability related to preloading VPN clients and plugins.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root-level privileges, allowing them to alter system behavior. This code can persist across device reboots.
- **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated, local attacker with administrator privileges can copy a crafted file to the `disk0:` file system of an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local access to the device
    - Authentication with administrator-level privileges
