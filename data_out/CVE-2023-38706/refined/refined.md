- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malicious user can create an unlimited number of drafts with very long draft keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted creation of drafts leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) due to server resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low privileges are required for an attacker to create drafts. No user interaction is required.
