{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the Service template name, allowing it to be used in an onclick event handler without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to cookie stealing, or the attacker can execute other features of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious service template name which will be stored by the application. This malicious name will be reflected in the delete button's onclick event, triggering the injected script when a user attempts to delete the service template.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to create or modify a service template name.  User interaction is also required to trigger the XSS."
