- **Root cause of vulnerability**: FlatPress CMS v1.3.1 stores authentication data, including usernames and hashed passwords, directly in client-side cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure storage of sensitive information in client-side cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Exposure of usernames and hashed passwords.
    - Potential unauthorized access and manipulation of the authentication data.
    - Impersonation of users.
    - Offline decryption of hashed passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to client-side cookies by an attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access or modify the client-side cookies of a FlatPress CMS user. This could be achieved through various means such as local machine access, network sniffing (if cookies aren't transmitted securely), or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
