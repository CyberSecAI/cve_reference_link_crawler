Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing permissions check in the SMB1/2/3 protocols' "ChangeNotify" mechanism. This mechanism allows a client to request notifications for file system changes (e.g., new file creation, file size changes) on a directory handle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** A client with a directory handle opened with only `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` (minimal access rights) could receive change notifications. These notifications contain information that should be restricted for handles with such limited permissions.
*   **Information Leak:** The change notify replies expose file and directory information to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An authenticated user, with limited access rights, can obtain file and directory information they shouldn't have access to. This may include file names and other metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited through the SMB protocol.
*   **Authenticated User Required:** An attacker needs to have an authenticated SMB session to exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs a valid user account to connect to the vulnerable SMB server.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must have access to at least open a directory with FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES.
*   **Specific Configuration:** The most significant risk occurs when Samba is configured with VFS modules that decouple Windows ACLs from the underlying filesystem permissions, and with share settings such as `vfs_objects = vfs_acl_xattr` and `acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all Samba versions since 3.6.0.
*   The issue is that the change notify request bypasses the Windows ACL restrictions if the underlying file system permissions differ.
*   Patches were released for Samba versions 4.11.15, 4.12.9, and 4.13.1.
*   The CVSSv3 base score is 4.3, classified as medium severity.
