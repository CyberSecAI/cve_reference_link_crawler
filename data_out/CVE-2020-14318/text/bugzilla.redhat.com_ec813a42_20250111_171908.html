| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1892631#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-10-29 11:11:08 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  The SMB1/2/3 protocols have a concept of "ChangeNotify", where a client can request file name notification on a directory handle when a condition such as "new file creation" or "file size change" or "file timestamp update" occurs.  A missing permissions check on a directory handle requesting ChangeNotify meant that a client with a directory handle open only for FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES (minimal access rights) could be used to obtain change notify replies from the server. These replies contain information that should not be available to directory handles open for FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTE only.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1892631#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-10-29 11:11:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Samba project Upstream: Steven French (Microsoft and the Samba Team)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1892631#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-10-29 11:11:25 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2020-14318.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1892631#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-10-29 11:11:29 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  As Samba internally opens an underlying file system handle on a directory when a client requests an open, even for FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES then if the underlying file system permissions don't allow "r" (read) access for the connected user, then the handle open request will be denied.  "r" access is the normal permission needed to list or otherwise reveal the contents of a directory, so if a connected user has "r" access then they will be able to list the directory contents normally, and the information received by a ChangeNofity request is already available to the user.  The security issue occurs if the Administrator or directory owner had set more restrictive Windows ACL permissions on the directory to disallow read access to the user, and this permissions change was not reflected in the underlying file system permissions.  This will only occur if Samba is configured with VFS modules to decouple the underlying file system permissions from the Windows ACLs, by setting up a share with the settings:  [vulnerable_share]         vfs_objects = vfs_acl_xattr         acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1892631#c4)  Huzaifa S.
