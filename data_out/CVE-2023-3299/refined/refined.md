- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Sentinel policies in Nomad Enterprise could access a caller's ACL token secret ID, which is not required for policy enforcement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of the ACL token secret ID to Sentinel policies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A poorly specified Sentinel policy could access and potentially leak the token's secret ID to command and API output.
- **Attack vectors:** Submitting a Sentinel policy to a Nomad cluster with a management token, where the policy explicitly reads the secret from the token as `nomad_acl_token.secret_id`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a management token to submit a Sentinel policy to a Nomad cluster. The attacker also needs to be able to write a Sentinel policy that extracts the token secret id.
