- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of untrusted data in the Cboot module `tegrabl_cbo.c` when TFTP is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution, loss of integrity, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Elevated privileges and TFTP must be enabled.
