## CVE-2022-27779

# cookie for trailing dot TLD

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27779.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains
(TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot.

curl can be told to receive and send cookies when communicating using
HTTP(S). curl's "cookie engine" can be built with or without [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) awareness. If
PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to at least
prevent cookies from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if the
hostname in the URL uses a trailing dot.

This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get
sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.

## INFO

This vulnerability only exists when curl is built without [libpsl](https://rockdaboot.github.io/libpsl/). Without this PSL
support built-in, curl is also destined to possibly leak cookies cross
sites simply due to how public suffixes work.

This flaw is similar to [CVE-2014-3620](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3620.html),
although in 2014 curl did not have PSL support.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27779 to this issue.

CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) to and including curl [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7e92d12b4e6911f>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Build libcurl with libpsl support

D - Do not use cookies

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.
