Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-0845:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `render` function of the PDF Viewer for Elementor plugin. This lack of proper handling allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when rendering the PDF viewer. Specifically, the `pdf_url` variable is used in the iframe's `src` attribute without sanitization, and the `width` and `height` variables are concatenated into the `style` attribute without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages using the vulnerable plugin. This malicious script will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the plugin's settings. An attacker can insert malicious code when specifying the PDF URL or dimensions through the plugin settings interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site.
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker must be able to access and modify plugin settings for the 'PDF Viewer for Elementor' plugin.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in both `pdf-viewer.php` and `pdfjs-viewer.php` files within the plugin's `widgets` directory.
* The vulnerable code in `pdf-viewer.php` is located around line 260
* The vulnerable code in `pdfjs-viewer.php` is located around line 219
* The vulnerable code uses iframe to embed the pdf and directly concats the unsanitized pdf url and styles.
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.9.3.
