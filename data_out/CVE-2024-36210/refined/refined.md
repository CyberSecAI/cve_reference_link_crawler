The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that lists multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-36210. Here's the information regarding CVE-2024-36210 extracted from the document:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-36210

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**CWE:** CWE-79

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution

**Severity:** Important

**CVSS Base Score:** 5.4

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Privileges Required:** Low (PR:L) - The attacker needs to have some level of access to the application.
*   **User Interaction:** Required (UI:R) - Exploitation requires a user to interact with the crafted malicious content.
*   **Scope:** Changed (S:C) - The vulnerability affects resources beyond the attacker's control.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and later executed in the context of other users.

**Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

**Additional Notes:**
* The bulletin lists many other CVEs that are also fixed in the same update.
* This vulnerability is categorized as "Important," and exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in a user's browser.
* The bulletin recommends updating to the latest versions of AEM to mitigate the risks.
