- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in an SMC (Secure Monitor Call) call handler within the NVIDIA Trusted OS. The issue stems from a failure to validate untrusted input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leads to potential information disclosure and integrity compromise.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to information disclosure and compromise of integrity. The impact may extend to other system components.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker is required to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting that the attacker already needs to have some level of access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be highly privileged and have local access to the system.
