Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + ATA 191 Analog Telephone Adapter   + IP Conference Phone 7832   + IP Conference Phone 8832   + IP Phone 7800 Series   + IP Phone 8800 Series   + IP Phone 8845 and 8865   + Unified IP Phone 3905   + Unified IP Phone 6901 and 6911   + Video Phone 8875   + Webex Room Phone   + Webex Share   + Webex Wireless Phones 840 and 860   + Wireless IP Phone 8821  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20376: Cisco IP Phone DoS Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi64103](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64103), [CSCwi64077](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64077)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20376Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  **CVE-2024-20378: Cisco IP Phone Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for specific endpoints of the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device, enabling the recording of user credentials and traffic to and from the affected device, including VoIP calls that could be replayed.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi64037](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64037), [CSCwi64050](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64050)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20378Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2024-20357: Cisco IP Phone Unauthorized Access Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the XML service of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to initiate phone calls on an affected device.  This vulnerability exists because bounds-checking does not occur while parsing XML requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to initiate calls or play sounds on the device.     **Note:** The XML service is disabled by default.        Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwi64082](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64082), [CSCwi64064](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi64064)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20357Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.  **IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Multiplatform Firmware**          | Cisco Multiplatform Firmware Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 12.0.4 and earlier | 12.0.4SR1 |       **Video Phone 8875**          | Cisco PhoneOS Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 2.3.1.001 and earlier | 2.3.1.0101 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
