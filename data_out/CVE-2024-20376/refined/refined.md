- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper input sanitization/validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device's web interface. No authentication is required.
