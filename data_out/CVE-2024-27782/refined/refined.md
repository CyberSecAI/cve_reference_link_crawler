- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient session expiration in FortiAIOps.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple instances of insufficient session expiration (CWE-613), leading to improper session management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reuse stolen, old session tokens to perform unauthorized actions through crafted requests. This leads to improper access control.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted requests using stolen session tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid session token, which can be achieved through means not specified in the advisory, such as network sniffing, phishing, or malware. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to use stolen tokens.
