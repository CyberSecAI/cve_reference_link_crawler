Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw within the Hotel-Management-System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `/admin_modify_room.php` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges by exploiting the vulnerability. The details of how this privilege escalation is achieved are not explicitly provided.
*   **Data Breach:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin_modify_room.php` endpoint.
*   **Injected SQL via Request Parameters:** The parameters `book_id` and `checkout` are potentially used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable endpoint `/admin_modify_room.php` and the injection point within parameters `book_id` and `checkout`.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests with injected SQL payloads.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes a SQLmap command to test and exploit the vulnerability.
*   The content includes a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability with a payload sent to the `book_id` and `checkout` parameters.
*  The specific commit that introduced this vulnerability is identified (commit<=91caab8e505a1791780594d23408fb31fcc272cc).
