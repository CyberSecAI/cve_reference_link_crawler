{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `format_fractional_part_nsecs` function in `wsutil/to_str.c`. This function was not correctly calculating the remaining buffer space when appending fractional time components. Additionally, it was using the full buffer size instead of the remaining space in the buffer and not properly checking the return value from snprintf. ",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Incorrect buffer size calculations",
      "Improper handling of snprintf return values"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the buffer overflow. This would lead to a crash or unexpected behavior of the wireshark application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The specific attack vector is not explicitly described in the content, however, it can be inferred it is triggered by processing network traffic containing timestamps that result in a large number of fractional nanoseconds.",
       "An attacker could craft a malicious packet or pcap file with specific timestamps to trigger the overflow."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted network traffic or provide a malformed pcap file to wireshark."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "patch_information": "The vulnerability is fixed in commit `c3720cff158c265dec2a0c6104b1d65954ae6bfd` which includes multiple fixes:\n\n- `format_fractional_part_nsecs()` now returns the number of bytes formatted.\n- Checks if the nanosecond count is greater than or equal to 1 billion, and reports that specially.\n- Fixes places where it used the buffer pointer and size of the buffer, rather than the current position in the buffer and the remaining space in the buffer.\n- Variable renames and comment fixes.",
      "affected_versions": "Wireshark versions prior to 4.2.0 are affected. The provided Fedora update includes Wireshark version 4.2.3 which addresses this issue."
