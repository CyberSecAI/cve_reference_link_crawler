The provided content relates to CVE-2024-46076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in RuoYi <=4.7.9's code generation feature that allows attackers to escape from comments, leading to code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code Injection: The primary vulnerability is code injection due to the ability to break out of comments.
- Insecure Code Generation: The code generation feature is not properly handling comments, allowing for malicious code injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be initiated remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the code generation feature of the RuoYi application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated before exploiting the vulnerability.
