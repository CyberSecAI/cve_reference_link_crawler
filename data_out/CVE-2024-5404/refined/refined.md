- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Forgot Password" function in ifm's moneo software has a weak password recovery mechanism. Specifically, if no mail server is configured, an attacker can reset the admin password to a default value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-640, which is a weakness related to a password recovery mechanism that does not adequately protect against unauthorized password resets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain privileged access by resetting the admin password, leading to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required. The system must have no mail server configured.
