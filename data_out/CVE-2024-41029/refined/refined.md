{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The cell sysfs attribute was providing more access to the nvmem data than the main attribute itself, violating intended access restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The cell sysfs attribute did not properly inherit the access restrictions of the main attribute. Specifically, if `nvme_config::root_only` was set, the cell attribute would still allow read access to all users.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain unauthorized read access to nvmem data through the cell sysfs attribute, potentially exposing sensitive information that should have been restricted.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing the vulnerable cell sysfs attribute.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with access to the sysfs interface."
