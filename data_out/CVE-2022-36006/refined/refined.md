Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization within the Ruby on Rails based Arvados Workbench application ("Workbench 1"). The application was using an unsafe method for parsing JSON payloads, leading to the possibility of remote code execution. Specifically, the issue was with how the `Oj` gem was being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure deserialization of JSON payloads using the `Oj` gem, prior to version 2.4.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted JSON payloads to the vulnerable "Workbench 1" application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending specially crafted JSON payloads to the "Workbench 1" application.
- The attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate against the Arvados system.
- The attacker requires network access to the Arvados "Workbench 1" application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails "Workbench 1" application, not the Typescript based "Workbench 2" or API server.
* The issue was addressed in Arvados version 2.4.2 by using the `Oj.safe_load` or `Oj.strict_load` methods.
* A workaround for earlier versions (before 2.4.2) is to remove the "Workbench 1" application or use "Workbench 2" or command line tools.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GHSL team member @p- (Peter St√∂ckli).
* This CVE is associated with GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-8867-q4xf-cqgm.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Critical".
