# Arvados 2.4.2 Release Notes

## August 9, 2022

The Arvados team is pleased to announce Arvados 2.4.2.

This release includes a critical security update to address
vulnerability GHSL-2022-063, described below. We strongly recommend
that *all* installations of Arvados, especially those accessible via the
public Internet, upgrade to 2.4.2 as soon as possible. See
[Upgrading Arvados](https://doc.arvados.org/v2.4/admin/upgrading.html) for
upgrade instructions.

In addition, this release includes several performance improvements,
usability improvements, and bug fixes.

## Security updates

### GHSL-2022-063

GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) reported a remote code execution (RCE)
vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench that allows authenticated attackers
to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads.

This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.2 ([#19316](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19316))

It is likely that this vulnerability exists in all versions of Arvados up to 2.4.1.

This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails Workbench
application (âWorkbench 1â). We do not believe any other Arvados
components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench
application (âWorkbench 2â) or API Server, are vulnerable to this
attack.

### CVE-2022-31163 and CVE-2022-32224

As a precaution, Arvados 2.4.2 has includes security updates for Ruby
on Rails and the TZInfo Ruby gem. However, there are no known
exploits in Arvados based on these CVEs.

## New Features

[#18984](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/18984)

The âTypeâ column filters in the Workbench 2 Projects view are now
expanded by default, and intermediate workflow steps are now hidden by
default.

[#18203](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/18203)

In Workbench 2, after adding a metadata element to a Project or
Collection, the âkeyâ is not cleared and focus remains on the âvalueâ
field, making it easier to enter multiple values for the same key.

[#19177](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19177)

There is now a configuration option for admins to disable the user
interface for the âsharing linkâ feature (URLs which can be sent to
users to access the data in a specific collection in Arvados without
an Arvados account), for organizations where sharing links violate
their data sharing policy.

[#18975](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/18975)

Workflow logs on Workbench 2 now show âMain logsâ by default, which is
a combination of the crunch-run, stdout and stderr logs. Following
scrolling has also been improved.

[#16070](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/16070)

Workbench 2 now features a new panel showing the command line used to
invoke a workflow or workflow step.

[#19231](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19231)

Workbench 2 now has options for smaller page sizes (10 and 20 items)
to speed up loading project contents.

[#19282](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19282)
[#19220](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19220)

Added new method to the Java SDK to upload files via Keep Web API. The
Java SDK uses config parameter to fetch api token in KeepClient.

## Bug Fixes

[#19192](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19192)

Fixed an internal, silent failure in `keep-web` that would prevent use
of the manifest cache after `keep-web` was running for a while,
resulting in poor performance accessing files in Keep via HTTP, WebDAV
and S3 APIs until the service was restarted. `keep-web` now correctly
uses the cache and maintains consistent performance.

[#19153](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19153)

In the Workbench 2 collection file browser, following the URL
resulting from âCopy to clipboardâ will now open the file content in
the browser, instead of forcing a file download.

[#19297](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19297)

Workbench 2 advanced search by metadata property now works as intended, instead of returning an error.

[#19305](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19305)

When using the âbreadcrumbs barâ to edit Project properties, the
existing metadata properties are now loaded correctly.

[#19296](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19296)

Fixed Python SDK bug in `Collection.remove` where the `recursive` flag
was not propagated, preventing removal of more than one level of
directories. Recursively removing deep directory trees in Collections
now works as intended.

[#18965](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/18965)

When navigating to destination on Workbench 2 but not logged in, the
user is redirected to a login page, and after logging in, now
correctly navigated back to the page they intended to visit.

[#19142](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19142)

Workbench 2 âAll processesâ and âSubprocessesâ panels now load faster
by limiting which fields of the container record are requested.

[#19321](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19321)

When launching a workflow on Workbench 1, workflow inputs with âenumâ type are now displayed and set correctly.

[#19280](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/19280)

When submitting very large workflows with `arvados-cwl-runner`,
particularly those defined entirely in a single file, the time spent
in initialization (before the first workflow step is submitted) has
been greatly reduced.
