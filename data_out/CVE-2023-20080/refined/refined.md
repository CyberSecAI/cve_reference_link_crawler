- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of data boundaries when processing DHCPv6 messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of data boundaries within the IPv6 DHCP (DHCPv6) relay and server features of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software. Specifically, the software does not adequately check the size or format of data in incoming DHCPv6 messages. This missing validation allows an attacker to potentially send crafted messages that exceed expected limits or contain unexpected data patterns.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and involves sending crafted DHCPv6 messages to an affected device. The attacker does not need to authenticate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco device which is configured with IPv6 enabled and either DHCPv6 relay or server feature enabled. The attacker does not require any special credentials or authentication. The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable service, which may involve sending messages across a network.
