Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a combination of factors:

1.  **Hard-coded, Default User Credentials:** The presence of a "nobody" user with an empty password ("") that can access the REST API.
2.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The firmware update API endpoint (`/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update`) can be accessed by low-privileged users, specifically the "nobody" user.
3.  **Lack of Firmware Verification:** The device does not perform cryptographic verification of the firmware before flashing it, relying only on basic checksum and magic number checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The "nobody" user account with a blank password enables unauthorized API access.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Low-privileged users are able to initiate firmware updates, which should be restricted to administrators.
*   **Missing Cryptographic Verification:** The absence of cryptographic signatures on firmware allows for the installation of modified/malicious firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious firmware, an attacker can achieve RCE on the device, gaining root privileges.
*   **Persistent Backdoor:** The attacker can install a persistent backdoor, providing full control even after a device reboot.
*   **Full Device Compromise:**  The attacker can fully compromise the device and access all data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device (e.g., on the same local network or through an exposed internet facing port).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint (`/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update`) and the ability to exploit the "nobody" user.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Firmware:** The attacker must be able to create a firmware image that passes basic integrity checks while containing malicious code.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Radek Domanski and Pedro Ribeiro.
*   They initially planned to present their findings at the Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020 hacking competition.
*   The researchers developed a proof-of-concept exploit and a patch for the vulnerability, as Western Digital didn't provide an official patch for MyCloud OS 3.
*   Western Digital released MyCloud OS 5, which is a complete rewrite of the OS and not a patch, which rendered the original vulnerability chain not directly exploitable in the new OS, but was released shortly before the Pwn2Own competition, seemingly to prevent the researchers' demonstration and gain a false "security victory".
*  The researchers detail a specific method for exploitation, which involves crafting a firmware image that replaces the `upnp_nas_device` daemon, starting an unauthenticated telnet shell, allowing for root access.
*   The provided patch disables the low-privileged access to the firmware update endpoint by modifying the `module.config.xml` file. However, this patch is not permanent and requires re-application after every reboot.
