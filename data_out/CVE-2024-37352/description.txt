There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
management UI of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.06 that allows
attackers with system administrator permissions to interfere with other system
administratorsâ€™ use of the management UI when the second administrator accesses
the vulnerable page. The scope is unchanged, there is no loss of
confidentiality. Impact to system integrity is high, impact to system
availability is none.
