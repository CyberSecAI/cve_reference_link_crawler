- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the management UI of Absolute Secure Access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  XSS vulnerability exists within the administrative console.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with system administrator permissions can inject malicious scripts that execute when another administrator accesses the vulnerable page. This allows for interference with other administrators' use of the management UI. The impact to integrity is high, while confidentiality is not impacted, and system availability is not impacted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via the network. An attacker must have administrative access to the vulnerable system. The attacker injects malicious code via the system UI. A separate admin has to access the page to trigger the script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have system administrator privileges on the Absolute Secure Access system. They need to be able to inject malicious code via the UI. The victim must be a system administrator who is accessing the compromised page.
