Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-3196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Canopsis application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the login footer and login page description parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS (CWE-79): The application allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the login footer and login page description parameters which are then stored in the application database. This payload is then executed when other users view these pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need access to the administration panel of the Canopsis application.
- The attacker can inject the malicious script by modifying the login footer and login page description parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or access to the admin panel to modify the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Canopsis version 23.04-alpha3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Pedro José Navas Pérez of Hispasec.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Canopsis version 23.10.0.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-4564, which is also an XSS vulnerability in Canopsis.
- The provided links to the source code show the sanitized code (html.js) and where the options are applied (config.js), which were likely implemented to address this issue.
