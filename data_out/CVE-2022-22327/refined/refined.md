- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application may use the system default TLS protocol instead of the application configured value when install.server.ssl.enabledProtocols is set to a non-default value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper use of configured TLS protocols which may cause the system to use less secure protocols than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Use of weaker TLS protocols may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept communication between the Urbancode Deploy Web-Agent and the server.
