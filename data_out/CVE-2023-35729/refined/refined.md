Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35729

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the DDP service. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:**  Multiple instances of this vulnerability are identified within the DDP service, affecting various functionalities (e.g., user verification, reboot, reset, config backup/restore, firmware upgrade, and other settings). These overflows occur when handling user-supplied inputs for usernames, passwords, IP addresses, file names, and other parameters.
- **Missing Authentication (one instance):** There is one instance of a missing authentication vulnerability related to getting SSID information
- **Hardcoded Credentials (one instance)**: The device uses hardcoded credentials for the Telnet CLI

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflows allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges.
- **Information Disclosure**: One vulnerability allows for the disclosure of WPA PSK information

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Adjacent:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- **DDP Service:** The vulnerabilities reside within the DDP service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable D-Link DAP-2622 device.
- **No Authentication Required** Most of the listed vulnerabilities do not require authentication to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerabilities affect the D-Link DAP-2622 hardware revision Ax with firmware versions v1.00 and below.
- The vulnerabilities were reported by Trend Micro ZDI.
- D-Link has released a beta-hotfix firmware (v1.10B03R022) to address these issues.
- The advisory also mentions multiple other similar stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the same device.
- The ZDI advisory provides a CVSS score of 8.8 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high severity vulnerability.
