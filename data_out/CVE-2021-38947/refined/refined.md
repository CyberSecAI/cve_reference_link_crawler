Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management software has multiple security weaknesses stemming from:

*   Use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms
*   Weak authentication mechanisms
*   Inadequate password rules

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Weak Cryptography: Use of insecure cryptographic algorithms.
*   Weak Authentication: Flaws in the authentication process.
*   Weak Password Rules: Insufficient enforcement of password complexity.
*   Arbitrary Command Execution: Vulnerability to execution of arbitrary commands.
*   Information Disclosure: Vulnerability to obtaining sensitive information.
*   Clickjacking: Vulnerability to clickjacking attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Compromise system security due to weak cryptography, authentication and passwords.
*   Execute arbitrary commands on the system.
*   Gain access to sensitive information.
*   Manipulate user actions through clickjacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

* The specific attack vectors are not detailed but could involve network-based attacks exploiting the web interface of the application, or the exploitation of the other vulnerabilities like weak auth, weak crypto or password rules.
*   Clickjacking would require user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would likely need network access to the IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management system to exploit most of these vulnerabilities.
*   For clickjacking, the attacker would need to lure a user to interact with a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The vulnerability affects IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management versions 2.2.13 and below.
*   A fix is available in version 2.2.14.
*   No workarounds or mitigations are available.
