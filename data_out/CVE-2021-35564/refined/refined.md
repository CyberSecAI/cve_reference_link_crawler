Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-35564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw related to "keystore integrity" within the OpenJDK Java runtime.  Specifically, there is an issue related to how the keystore handles loading or validating data, potentially leading to a security breach if the integrity is compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Keystore Integrity Issue:** A weakness exists in how the Java keystore manages the integrity of its data. This could involve flaws in data validation, parsing or handling. The specifics of this integrity failure are not detailed in the advisory itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability could allow a compromise to the keystore integrity. The potential specific impacts are not stated, however it may allow tampering with data held in the keystore, possibly leading to unauthorized access, impersonation, or data corruption. The CVSS score of 5.3 suggests that this may be difficult to achieve, and the integrity impact is only described as "low".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Exploitation of this vulnerability is primarily through network access, implying that it can be triggered remotely, rather than requiring local access. This makes it much more accessible to malicious actors. However, it is also noted that exploitation requires no user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** No special system privileges are required. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can send a crafted input or otherwise manipulate the data that OpenJDK uses.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** This is a major factor for its potential high severity since it doesn't require the user to perform an action for the attack to succeed.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable application through the network

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in OpenJDK versions 8u312-b07, 11.0.13+8, and 17.0.1+12.
*   Multiple sources, including Debian, Fedora and NetApp, confirm that this CVE has been addressed in their security updates for OpenJDK.
*  Oracle also included this fix in their October 2021 CPU.

In summary, CVE-2021-35564 points to a flaw in OpenJDK related to keystore integrity, accessible remotely without user interaction, potentially allowing for data tampering or other security compromises. While not rated as critical by itself, its impact could be significant when chained with other exploits.
