- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper management of mDNS client entries in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway feature of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the mDNS gateway feature handles client entries. Specifically, the system does not properly manage these entries, leading to a potential resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to high CPU utilization on the wireless controller. This high utilization can cause access points (APs) to lose their connection to the controller, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for the wireless network.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the wireless network and sending a continuous stream of specific mDNS packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker, meaning they need to be within the wireless network's range to connect and send the malicious packets.
