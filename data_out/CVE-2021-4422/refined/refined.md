The provided content relates to CVE-2021-4422.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `handleCsvExport()` function of the Post SMTP Mailer plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to improper nonce validation. Specifically, the `handleCsvExport()` function does not properly verify the nonce, allowing an attacker to bypass the security check if the nonce parameter is not present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can trigger a CSV export by tricking a site administrator into clicking a crafted link or performing another action that submits a forged request. This could lead to unauthorized data exfiltration or other potential malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a forged HTTP request targeting the vulnerable `handleCsvExport()` function. This request is triggered when a logged-in administrator is tricked into clicking a malicious link, or visiting a malicious page controlled by the attacker, thus submitting the request on behalf of the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or page that initiates the forged HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker also needs to trick an authenticated administrator of the target WordPress site into interacting with the crafted link, which will then trigger the malicious action.
