**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the `deleteCheckSession` method of LG Simple Editor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal vulnerability: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory.
- Arbitrary File Deletion: By exploiting the directory traversal, an attacker can delete arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Remote attackers can delete arbitrary files on affected systems.
-  The file deletion occurs in the context of the SYSTEM user, indicating a high level of impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network attack vector (AV:N)
- No user interaction required (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication is required (PR:N), meaning the attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected LG Simple Editor instance.
