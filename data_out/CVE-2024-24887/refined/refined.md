- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Contest Gallery plugin for WordPress versions <= 21.2.8.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions that can be triggered via CSRF.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks an authenticated user into submitting it (e.g., via a link or embedded image in an email or website).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user into triggering the crafted malicious request. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, but the impact depends on the privileges of the victim.
