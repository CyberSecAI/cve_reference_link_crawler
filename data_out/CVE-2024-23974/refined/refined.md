Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions in some Intel Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH) software installers.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installers have insecure default permissions that allow an attacker to leverage the software.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Escalation of privileges. An authenticated local user can gain higher privileges than intended.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access. The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the local system, and also must be able to interact with the installer software, which requires user interaction. The attacker also needs to have a certain level of knowledge on how to exploit default permissions of the software.
