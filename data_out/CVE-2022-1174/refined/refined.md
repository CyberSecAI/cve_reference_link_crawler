Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and resource limits when rendering content using the Kroki library within GitLab. Specifically, a large or specially crafted payload can be submitted as a comment and cause excessive resource consumption during the rendering process. The vulnerability occurs because Kroki library does not limit the size of data it is processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The GitLab instance does not properly sanitize or limit the size or complexity of input data being processed by the Kroki library.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Rendering of malicious Kroki diagram leads to high CPU usage

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS condition by submitting malicious Kroki payloads within comments in GitLab. This makes affected pages (issues, merge requests, wikis, etc.) unresponsive and unusable.
*   **Increased CPU Usage:** Rendering the malicious payload can dramatically increase CPU usage, potentially impacting the performance of the entire GitLab instance, especially in cloud environments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comment Injection:** An attacker injects a malicious Kroki payload within the comment section of any supported Gitlab feature (issues, merge requests, milestones, snippets, wiki pages, markdown documents inside repositories, and epics).
*   **Kroki Library:** The vulnerability relies on exploiting the way GitLab uses the Kroki library for rendering diagrams.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileged User:** A low-privileged user with the ability to create comments in a GitLab project is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Kroki Enabled:** The GitLab instance must have the Kroki integration enabled, either using the public server or a custom one.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted payload that causes high resource usage during rendering, rather than by exploiting a timeout or data-size limit. The issue is about excessive rendering leading to CPU usage, not the payload size itself.
*   The provided fix suggests implementing a mechanism to limit the characters or number of rendered blocks, similar to how Mermaid and Math rendering is handled in GitLab.
*  The vulnerability affects any feature using Kroki library including Bytefield, Ditaa, PlantUML and others.
