I understand that SSL certs cannot be signed using SHA-1 anymore. Yet, all CA root certificates are SHA-1 signed (mostly). Does it mean the same algorithm that is no longer trusted for "you grandma SSL shop" is fine for the uttermost top secured certificate of the world?

Am I missing something? (key usage? key size?)

The signature of the root CA certificates do not matter at all, since there is no need to verify them. They are all self-signed.

If you trust a root CA certificate, there’s no need to verify its signature. If you don’t trust it, its signature is worthless for you.

Edit: there are some very relevant comments below. I don’t feel comfortable copying or rephrasing them and taking credit for them instead of their authors. But I welcome people to add explanations to this answer.

* It seems to me that the concern with a crackable root cert isn't "you don't know where you got the root cert from", but rather "you don't know who else has been able to crack this cert and use it to sign whatever they want." And it seems from your answer that the two (cert and cert-signing) are separate concerns, and that the cert itself is suitably secure and uncrackable?

  I would go even further than "there is no need to verify them". The purpose of the signature in a certificate chain is that a higher authority certifies a lower authority. For a root CA, there is no higher authority *by definition* (that's what "root" means), so there *is nobody who could possibly sign the certificate*. Since, as was mentioned, certificates *must* be signed, root CAs are signed with a "dummy" signature, and the simplest way to do that, is to self-sign. So, not only is there no need to verify, the very *idea* of verifying the signature of a root CA is non-sensical.

  @DewiMorgan You can't "crack" a root cert with a hash collision, because the client trusts the *cert itself*, not its (self-)signature. You would have to recover the private key, which is an attack on RSA, not on the hash algorithm.

At the end of the day, a root certificate is self-signed. It is never signed by another entity except itself. The root certificate gets its trust through out-of-band processes like submitting it to a browsers list of trusted publishers, or getting it accepted by Microsoft for insertion into the default list of Windows trusted publishers.

These certificates (and the companies that self-signed them) are (allegedly, hopefully) thoroughly vetted through other means than just their signatures.

The only case where this matters, is if the root is signed by SHA-1 it can be revoked by SHA-1. That is, somebody who can attack SHA-1 can construct a revocation for the root. And I'm absolutely sure the browser doesn't know how to persist that so the vandal has accomplished no more than dropping SSL connections. How lame.

  This is an interesting thought but I doubt this would work just this way. My guess is that each agent would have it's own unique behavior, but I doubt any developers had the idea that the revocation list would be used to manage revocation of root certs. At the very least, if this worked in some cases, it would be due to abstraction of software revocation and not intentionally by developers.

As a note on this one, ***SOME*** CAs have already been updating their root and intermediate certificates to SHA256 anyway.

I know that last year GlobalSign was updating their certificates as we were updating our code-signing certificates, so I had to add their new chain to those, too.

You can check which specific certificates got updated and which ones they updated but also left a legacy SHA1 certificate for here => [1](https://support.globalsign.com/customer/portal/articles/1426602-globalsign-root-certificates)

Hope that helps.

For root CA, you give you trust to the public key of the CA -bundled in the CRT - regardless its self signature.

Describing CA using the .CRT file format instead of a raw public key .PEM allows to bundle more details in it - e.g. CA name - (yet again, the signature is worthless)

There are [very old, mostly 2006 or earlier era](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates)  already trusted pinned SHA1 root certificates that browsers accept, but not any newer certificates. Remember when Firefox and Chrome were versioned using single digits?

Certificates fail if the root CA uses SHA1 certificates with the Not Before set to something after 2014. The actual date restrictions depends on the browser or other application. The WebCA cabforum made this clear several years ago. Test this yourself by:

1. Create a private root Certificate Authority infrastructure signed with a SHA1, call it rootSHA1
2. Have rootSHA1 create an "issuing" CA or "intermediate" CA that issues certificates with a certificate chained up to the root. Call it intermediateSHA256.
3. Have the intermediateSHA256 issuing CA generate a certificates signed with a sha256 or greater hash. Call it webServerSHA256.
4. Install webServerSHA256 into the webServerSHA56.mydomain.com.
5. Install the rootSHA1, the intermediateSHA256, and the webServerSHA256 certificates into appropriate locations in Google Chrome. Install the root to Trusted Root Certification Authorities and the others with a certificate chain.
6. Navigate Google Chrome to <https://webServerSHA256.mydomain.com/> and verify there is not a green padlock for webServerSHA256. Test fails.

* This is quite wrong. *Intermediate* certs (and EE./leaf certs) do require SHA2, but roots do not. Google's own certs chain through their private CA (Google Internet Authority G3) to GlobalSign Root CA R2 -- which is SHA1 -- and (no surprise) are accepted by Chrome.

* What you are effectively demonstrating is that, the rootSHA1 certificate you are installing at step 5 in the relevant trust store, does not have the same level of trust associated as have the "CA root certificates" which are coming preinstalled with the browser or the system: the former should use SHA2 hashes to turn green, but the latter might use SHA1. The result is interesting in itself; but you did not really think you –or your IT team– might have the same level of trust as are having the developers of the browser, did you?

* Of course I do not believe our IT team has the same level of trust and that is exactly my point. Thank You. Even though the root cert is in the same trust store and signed the with a SHA1, it is not the same most likely because of the dateStamp. It is a demonstration that not all SHA1 root certificates are trusted by chrome even if you explicitly tell the web browser to trust it. It is immaterial that the root is signed by itself and the theoretical discussion above, Chrome would still not trust it because it was SHA1.

| Bug Description Hello ...  I've executed the Windows-Installer in a sandbox and examined the extracted-files (also the temp-files) and did a tiny check of the used certificates and the signed files and found some strange issues with the certficate-structure of this project: Strange installation of ROOT-CERTIFICATE in ROOT-store [cert-issues](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/83558069/283520809-a0517017-e01b-4202-bcd2-799a23658b3c.jpg?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.EMQ3_9XiO5AadSe8Kbz2460MqIrKpb0NdFQXCNTA1sY)  The certificate (fingerprint: d1dbb672d5a500b9809689caea1ce49e799767f0), that will be used to install and sign the driver under Windows ("rustdeskidddriver.cat") seems to be strange. It is a **self-signed test-certificate by an anonymous id: "WDKTestCert admin,133225435702113567" that will not use a trusted ROOT-CA and only uses SHA-1 with RSA 2048 (weak) with a timed validity of !! 10 Years !!, much too long for this weak algo !**  ```  Fingerprint: d1dbb672d5a500b9809689caea1ce49e799767f0  CN = WDKTestCert admin,133225435702113567  ``` The fact, that this certificate will be installed in the SYSTEM ROOT-CERTSORE is probably associated with a high risk ... Also the certificate, that signed the installed driver-dll **"RustDeskIddDriver.dll"** is not the same as the certifcate, that created / signed the catalog-file above:  ```  Fingerprint: b27892e774a8cbe382ba7ddcf4649a723b6532d8  CN = Zhou Huabing  O = Zhou Huabing  S = Central Singapore  C = SG  ```  This certificate was issued by "Sectigo Public Code Signing Root R46" ... How to Reproduce Check used certfile "RustDeskIddDriver.cer" of the installer and certificate of signed dll "RustDeskIddDriver.dll". Expected Behavior Usage of valid software-signatures, issued by a trusted ROOT-CA with "secure" algorithms for driver-installation and code-signing.

Fixed in latest release by removing our virtual display driver and cert, <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/latest>. It will be restored once we get an EV, 1 month or more. Thanks for everyone who are giving help on EV

| The certificate (fingerprint: d1dbb672d5a500b9809689caea1ce49e799767f0) is automatically used to sign the driver <https://github.com/fufesou/RustDeskIddDriver/releases/download/v0.4/RustDeskIddDriver_x64.zip> from <https://github.com/fufesou/RustDeskIddDriver> All Windows drivers must be signed, this is mandatory.  The certificate (fingerprint: b27892e774a8cbe382ba7ddcf4649a723b6532d8) was used to sign .dll and .exe from the rustdesk package. <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk> |

| The certificate purposes option in `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` is checked as `Enabled for All Purposes`. Shouldn't it be only for Code Signing? |

| I'm seeing this discussion spread over the internet like wildfire but, when I checked, the certificate only had an EKU for Code signing and KU for Key Encipherment and Data Encipherment; this is what I would expect to see from a certificate used for the stated purposes. TLS stacks (Eg: SChannel) should be adhering to those KU/EKU's; "Enabled for All Purposes" implies "-that are listed in KU/EKU's".  Regardless though, I think a certificate being pushed to end users should clearly identify itself and not use SHA-1, that should be rectified. |

| To add to this, you can verify and limit "purposes" by going into the certificate properties. The driver certificate only has Code Signing as an option.

| Frankly, as for 1,2, we do not know either, we are not expert in this field, maybe because it is test cert.  * why this certificat is in root store.  Because its explicitly installed there by `install_cert_runas_admin.bat` in the [RustDeskIddDriver](https://github.com/fufesou/RustDeskIddDriver).  ``` .\CertMgr.exe /add RustDeskIddDriver.cer /s /r localMachine root ``` |

Can you please tell me if the Virtual Display feature is removed in the next version, would that mean that I can no longer establish an unattended connection to a terminal server that has no attached monitor and/or active user session? Or is the Virtual Display Driver just to make things a bit prettier (resolution, etc.)? |

| This driver which is only signed with the Test-Certificate also leads to issues with ESET for example. ESET detects the RustDeskIddDriver.dll under %LOCALAPPDATA%\rustdesk\RustDeskIddDriver as Suspicious Object, moves it to the Quarantine and warns the user about it. |

| Fixed in latest release by removing our virtual display driver and cert, <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/latest>. It will be restored once we get an EV, 1 month or more.

[#222 (comment)](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/issues/222#issuecomment-1145626102), you can find more virtual display in this [discussion](https://github.com/pavlobu/deskreen/discussions/86).  please do not use [#6682 (comment)](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/issues/6682#issuecomment-1888704092), since it uses test cert as us also. Or buy a HDMI plug. [#222 (comment)](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/issues/222#issuecomment-1145644431) |

| I'm using this on an internal LAN (no risks of exploiting) where I don't care about this vulnerability but the feature is essential for me / "I accept the risks". Very disappointed to install latest nightly and the feature is gone, and sadly I replaced old installer binary. Can someone please share nightly build from 18 February 2024 or thereabout? I have a build from Dec 2023 but I would prefer more recent build. Thanks |

| Hi! This bug is still present in a way! When I install Rustdesk (official build) v1.2.3-1 on a fresh PC (test PC is Win11 23H2 for me) the cert IS NOT installed, but a new CERTIFICATE STORE (with the chinese text as the name of this "certificate folder") IS created in Windows. It is empty, but Rustdesk install creates it nontheless.

| This is so strange.  I checked the code of 1.2.3-1 again and it will not try install the cert.  Unless someone has administrator rights and manually executes the command, this is equivalent to using certmgr.exe.     [rustdesk/src/core\_main.rs](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/a71ec3e0e740c69c188641d4818d606201bbe1b4/src/core_main.rs#L205)  Line 205 in [a71ec3e](/rustdesk/rustdesk/commit/a71ec3e0e740c69c188641d4818d606201bbe1b4)   |  | hbb\_common::allow\_err!(crate::platform::windows::install\_cert(&args[1])); | | --- | --- |      Did you only install 1.2.3-1 and no other versions of RustDesk on your fresh PC? 1.2.3-1 does not have a certificate file, and install\_cert will return at the entrance.

| Actually, I have this too. But I don't know when it was created. Could have been before 2.3.1-1. I have two roots, one with a certificate in it, and one without. I have now deleted the certificate, uninstalled rustdesk, and installed nightly, and it is NOT created again.  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/28412477/319566901-256b745d-aefc-4532-a949-363f3847cf14.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.SFxI99ykgfru5mOHaLXMBCeSd0X2VRo7w_VY5lKZVqk)  Unfortunately, I cannot delete the branches! They are there, even if no certificate is inside. How can I delete them?  EDIT: Additional note: Actually, I had the WDKTest certificate in this Chinese Characters Certificate Store, as well as in the "Trusted Publishers Certificate Store". |

| Sorry for causing trouble to you guys.  You can delete strange branches by deleting the corresponding entries in regedit.   1. Open "certmgr.msc" 2. Open "regedit", delete the strange items. 3. Close and open "certmgr.msc".   If there're stille some strange items, you may not delete all items in "regedit". Refresh "regedit" and delete again.    b.mp4     **NOTE**  There should be more than one place, you may need to find "Ctrl + F" to search the registry.  ``` Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\UserDS  ``` |

| This code causes the strange cert directory.     [rustdesk/src/platform/windows.rs](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/a71ec3e0e740c69c188641d4818d606201bbe1b4/src/platform/windows.rs#L1982)  Line 1982 in [a71ec3e](/rustdesk/rustdesk/commit/a71ec3e0e740c69c188641d4818d606201bbe1b4)   |  | let store\_handle = CertOpenSystemStoreW(0 as \_, "ROOT\0".as\_ptr() as \_); | | --- | --- |      The corresponding C++ code is  ``` #pragma comment(lib, "crypt32.lib")  #include <Windows.h> #include <iostream>  int main(int argc, char* argv) { 	HCERTSTORE handle = CertOpenSystemStoreW(NULL, (LPCWSTR)"ROOT"); 	return 0; } ```  1.2.3-1 will not install the cert. But it will try to remove the old test certs.  It tries to read the certs in `ROOT` , then find the issuer of `"CN=\"WDKTestCert admin,133225435702113567\"\0"`. Remove all it's related certs. It will found no certs, and do nothing. But the directory is created and left there.  I'll try the code [#6444 (reply in thread)](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6444#discussioncomment-9014382) to remove the strange directories. |

| For my system(s) the test certs are in up to 4 locations:   * Trusted Publishers (only 1 system) * Trusted Root Certification Authorities * Short chinese dir * Long chinese dir (only 1 system)   this is why [ab07eb6](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/commit/ab07eb6f4a7df73aac12f295fb5b6775c1f14961) deletes the test certs from all stores of all users. This is very important. I don't know how it happened that the test certs spread in 4 different stores, but they did somehow. |

| It would be very important that it gets deleted from all stores, because I still don't understand why on some of my machines the certificate was in "Trusted Publishers" (which is as bad as "Trusted Root Certification Authorities") And the Rust code, will it also delete the wrong certificates from other users? This would also be important, because only user "X" will install/uninstall/update RustDesk, but there might be users "Y" and "Z" on that system (maybe other users with admin rights on a Terminal Server, who have previously installed and old RustDesk version).  I'll find a better way to delete all the certificates. Because the fingerprint is SHA1 hash of the cert. Simply delete "D1DBB672D5A500B9809689CAEA1CE49E799767F0" in the correct stores is not safe.   1. Traverse the SystemStore and find all stores and fingerprints where the issuer is CN="WDKTestCert admin,133225435702113567". Then delete. 2. Delete the certificate in the wrong store. 3. Delete the empty wrong store. |

| I am not familiar with the cryptapi, but I understand that CertOpenSystemStoreW() only opens HKLM but not any user store (and not other users stores)?  I wonder, would you feel more comfortable if the blob contents of the D1DBB672D5A500B9809689CAEA1CE49E799767F0 key are binary compared? The chance that a different certificate has the same SHA1 finger print is 2^160, so I think it is safe to assume the key with hash D1DBB672D5A500B9809689CAEA1CE49E799767F0 is the key we are looking for. Just parsing the cert and looking at the "CN" is much more ambiguous and can be freely chosen by humans.  If you want to make 100% sure, then you can analyze the Blob field. (Edit: see post below) |

| [@fufesou](https://github.com/fufesou) [@rustdesk](https://github.com/rustdesk)  What do you think about that? <https://gist.github.com/danielmarschall/0fadded4dbba7d790cc0f40723ec5990>  (Edit: Small change fixed in re management information. It now avoids to assume that the cert starts at offset 0x4C)  If you don't trust SHA1, then binary comparison is the way to go, then the tiny chance of collission changes from 2^160 to exactly 0.  I didn't look up the code how to read a blob from registry. I first wait if you like it or not. If you accept, than I will do the rest and implement it. |

There's a discussion on GitHub (https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6444) where one of the maintainers states the certificates are for driver code signing, but doesn't explain why they need to be placed in `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` with all purposes permissions instead of just for code signing. Does anyone more experienced in security have a take on this? |  | |  |  | [BandButcher](user?id=BandButcher) [11 months ago](item?id=39256590)   | [next](#39266403) [–]  Not a security expert, but this is a huge code smell. Always be cautious of trusting certs of any kind, especially test/dev certs with top level privileges lol personally i would avoid. Based on the issue there are too many weak points and the "response" given didnt seem to care about the vulnerabilities or user concerns, only said why its needed... The issue poster was smart in running in a sandbox and comparing files. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [BandButcher](user?id=BandButcher) [11 months ago](item?id=39256610)   | [parent](#39256590) | [next](#39266403) [–]  Never heard of this repo or library, but in the readme: "Yet another remote desktop software, written in Rust. Works out of the box, no configuration required. You have full control of your data, with no concerns about security".... Yikes. Please don't believe in every repo face value. Your best bet is to generate your own certs (<https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert>) and sign the dlls yourself. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ComputerGuru](user?id=ComputerGuru) [11 months ago](item?id=39266403)   | [prev](#39256590) | [next](#39266179) [–]  Placing a certificate in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities node – despite completely "owning" a machine – is ironically not enough for a certificate to be used for driver code signing as even those need to be cross-signed by Microsoft to be accepted for kernel-mode drivers. I'm not sure this explanation holds any water. (When it *does* suffice, the approach has *always* been generate a CA certificate on the device itself and install *that*, generate a cert signed by that CA to sign the code/driver with, then nuke the CA's private keys so they can't be used to sign anything else again. There would be *zero* need to *ever* use a real CA here.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaomidi](user?id=aaomidi) [11 months ago](item?id=39266179)   | [prev](#39266403) | [next](#39260030) [–]  Shame on Windows for just letting an application install a new root without express, and on-going user context. This is something that the OS should be at some regularity reminding the user that has happened. It is not reasonable for a user to assume that installing an application is just going to let that application completely switch the trusts on the computer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cpach](user?id=cpach) [11 months ago](item?id=39268631)   | [parent](#39266179) | [next](#39260030) [–]  Does Windows really not show any warnings at all in such a case? I would assume it does, but I’m not sure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39272130)   | [root](#39266179) | [parent](#39268631) | [next](#39260030) [–]  Windows doesn't show any special warnings for the certificate installation, just the usual UAC prompt. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rmhrisk](user?id=rmhrisk) [11 months ago](item?id=39281815)   | [root](#39266179) | [parent](#39272130) | [next](#39260030) [–]  If a root/admin user installs a root there is no prompt, if a user does, it is scoped to the individual user profile and a prompt is displayed. No prompt as root would be meaningful because the root/admin user could just update the configuration without using the API. Long story short, don't give root/admin to applications you don't trust. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaomidi](user?id=aaomidi) [11 months ago](item?id=39282694)   | [root](#39266179) | [parent](#39281815) | [next](#39260030) [–]  Right but basically all application installers basically require “root” on windows. This is an unfortunate side effect of how installation works on Windows I think. I really think we need to move closer to requesting permissions to specific things rather than a binary “admin or not”. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39260030)   | [prev](#39266179) | [next](#39260577) [–]  I've decided to remove the hosted version of the software I was operating, as well as the client applications from all my devices, until the situation is clarified. An insecure certificate, such as the one RustDesk is utilizing, should not have the extensive permissions it currently holds. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [foobarbaz33](user?id=foobarbaz33) [11 months ago](item?id=39260577)   | [prev](#39260030) | [next](#39296372) [–]  Maybe this app's real purpose is to be malware. Start off as a useful app to gain a large user base (trojan horses). Charge for it too, that makes it seem even more legit, but have a free tier to grow the user base. Then silently turn it into malware. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39296372)   | [prev](#39260577) | [next](#39260241) [–]  User asked these questions ([https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6444#discus...](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/6444#discussioncomment-8378643)): ```     "why this certificat is in root store.     why this certificat have a validity of 10 years and only use SHA-1.     why this certificat is different from the DLL one."  ``` RustDesk's answer: "Frankly, as for 1,2, we do not know either, we are not expert in this field, maybe because it is test cert. As for 3, dll is OV cert, but the driversigning requires EV cert, we do not have EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround. Someone in HN does not believe we do not have EV, but we really have not. :( But now I think it is time for us to get one." <https://i.ibb.co/bHjMYWH/2024-02-08-00h41-11.png> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cpach](user?id=cpach) [11 months ago](item?id=39260241)   | [prev](#39296372) | [next](#39258322) [–]  This is not acceptable. I would avoid this application, at all costs. You should never install a root certificate from someone, unless you want them to be able to silently MITM any TLS connection from your machine. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39260326)   | [parent](#39260241) | [next](#39258322) [–]  Some Discord users claim that the certificate required to sign the video driver is a Windows WDK certificate and not a Chinese one. However, the administrative details on the certificate are in Chinese, and there are concerns about the certificate's location and its permissions. Additionally, there are opinions that a code signing certificate is costly, but I disagree. Given their size, they can afford to spend $290 on an EV certificate (<https://signmycode.com/ev-code-signing>). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cpach](user?id=cpach) [11 months ago](item?id=39260673)   | [root](#39260241) | [parent](#39260326) | [next](#39258322) [–]  It it really was a certificate from Microsoft, why would it not be bundled with Windows? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39261987)   | [root](#39260241) | [parent](#39260673) | [next](#39258322) [–]  I don't know, but the certificate I found under Trusted Root Certification Authorities was set to "Enable all purposes for this certificate," which definitely shouldn't be the case. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pseudony](user?id=pseudony) [11 months ago](item?id=39258322)   | [prev](#39260241) | [next](#39260327) [–]  Oh lighten up, it's memory safe! /sic | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lobito14](user?id=lobito14) [11 months ago](item?id=39260327)   | [prev](#39258322) [2 more]  [flagged] | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thehamkercat](user?id=thehamkercat) [11 months ago](item?id=39266638)   | [parent](#39260327) [–]  Sounds like ChatGPT | | --- | --- | --- | | |
