Security

The following security issues are fixed in this release. Thanks to
Tom Wolters of Chapter8 and the National Cyber Security Centre in
The Netherlands for reporting the the first two findings.

* RT is vulnerable to accepting unvalidated RT email headers in
incoming email and the mail-gateway REST interface. This vulnerability
is assigned [CVE-2023-41259](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41259).

* RT is vulnerable to information leakage via response messages returned
from requests sent via the mail-gateway REST interface. This vulnerability
is assigned [CVE-2023-41260](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41260).

Related to the above, in addition to upgrading to this new version, access
to the mail-gateway REST endpoint can, and in most cases should, be restricted
to only the RT server itself (localhost). This access restriction can typically
be applied in the web server running with your RT (Apache or other). This
configuration is more clearly documented as part of this release and we recommend
all RT admins review your web server configuration and consider restricting access
to this mail-gateway REST endpoint.

* RT 5.0 is vulnerable to information leakage via transaction searches made by
authenticated users in the transaction query builder. This vulnerability is
assigned [CVE-2023-45024](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45024). Thanks to edk and bakerst of Libera Chat for reporting
this finding.

* RT 5.0 can reveal information about data on various RT objects in errors and
other response messages to REST 2 requests.
