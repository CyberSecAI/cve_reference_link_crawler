- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Broken Access Control vulnerability in the attachments feature of Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control allows users with read permissions to a Confluence page to upload attachments, even without write permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with read access to a Confluence page can upload attachments, potentially leading to the introduction of malicious files or unauthorized modification of content.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker with read permissions to a Confluence page exploits the vulnerability through the attachments feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have read permissions to a page on the vulnerable Confluence instance. They don't require write access to the page to upload attachments.
