```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `addWifiMacFilter` function has a stack overflow vulnerability due to the insecure use of `sprintf`. The `deviceMac` parameter received from a POST request is directly used in `sprintf` without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow",
    "Unbounded sprintf usage"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "By overflowing the stack, an attacker can overwrite the return address and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to full control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint with an overly long `deviceMac` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Tenda FH1203 router. This could be an attacker on the same network or someone who has access to the router's web interface."
