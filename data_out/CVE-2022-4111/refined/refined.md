Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** The commit `01cd3f0464747973ec329e9fb1ea12743d3235cc` addresses a missing file size validation for user avatar uploads in the ToolJet project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The code previously lacked a check on the size of uploaded avatar files. Without this check, users could potentially upload extremely large files, leading to denial of service or other issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation on the uploaded file size.
- **Potential for Denial of Service:** The absence of file size limits could allow an attacker to upload very large files, potentially causing server performance issues or storage exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading large files, an attacker could potentially overwhelm the server, making it slow or unresponsive.
-   **Storage Exhaustion:** Repeatedly uploading large files could consume a large amount of disk space on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the user avatar upload functionality. An attacker would upload a file exceeding the intended limits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user to access the avatar upload functionality.
-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint/route where avatar uploads happen.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented adds a `MAX_AVATAR_FILE_SIZE` constant (2MB) and a check within the `addAvatar` function to validate the uploaded file size.
*   If the uploaded file size exceeds the limit, the server now throws a `BadRequestException`.
*   The commit message is "fix: add max file size validator for user avatar", clearly stating the purpose of the change.
*   The code change adds 16 lines and deletes 1, primarily introducing the size validation.

This information is relevant to CVE-2022-4111 as it is a vulnerability related to file upload without validation, which could lead to denial-of-service or storage exhaustion. Based on this information, it is likely related.
