Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-36527:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `puppeteer-renderer` service does not validate the `url` parameter, which allows the use of the `file` protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation on the `url` parameter.
- Allowing the `file` protocol in the URL parameter which enables local file access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to the service with a `file://` URL as the `url` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `puppeteer-renderer` service.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `puppeteer-renderer` versions prior to 3.3.0.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Mitigation includes updating to version 3.3.0 or later, and implementing input validation to restrict the `url` parameter to only `http` and `https` protocols.
