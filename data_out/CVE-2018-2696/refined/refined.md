    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to sha256_password authentication DoS via long password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
