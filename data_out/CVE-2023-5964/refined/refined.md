Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `1E-Exchange-DisplayMessage` instruction, part of the End-User Interaction product pack, fails to properly validate the `Caption` and `Message` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The software does not adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `Caption` and `Message` parameters of the `1E-Exchange-DisplayMessage` instruction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By providing specially crafted input to the vulnerable parameters, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.
- SYSTEM Permissions: The code execution occurs with SYSTEM-level privileges, granting the attacker significant control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
- Crafted Input: The attacker needs to craft a specific input string containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges: The attacker only needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability. This is indicated by 'PR:L' in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Component:** `1E-Exchange-DisplayMessage` instruction within the End-User Interaction product pack on the 1E Exchange.
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of the 1E Platform prior to 23.
- **Remediation:**
    - Delete the vulnerable instruction `Show dialogue with caption %Caption% and message %Message%`.
    - Replace it with the updated `1E-Exchange-ShowNotification` instruction (version 7.1 or higher). The new instruction should be named as "Show %Type% type notification with header %Header% and message %Message%".
- The provided CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating that the vulnerability is network exploitable, requires low privileges, and results in a complete compromise of the system with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
