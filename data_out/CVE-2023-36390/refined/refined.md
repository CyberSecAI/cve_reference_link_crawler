    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions within the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into clicking a crafted link containing malicious JavaScript.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to rely on user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, specifically, by getting them to click a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the "action" parameter.
- The attacker must be able to convince a user to click this link. This can be done through social engineering, phishing, or by posting the malicious link on a website or other platform that the user might access.
