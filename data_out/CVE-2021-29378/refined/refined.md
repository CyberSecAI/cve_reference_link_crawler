- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `list` function within the `app/admin/controller/admin/Crud.php` file. The function directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$name`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The direct concatenation of the `$name` variable into the SQL query creates an SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the `$name` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can obtain sensitive user data and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server. This could lead to complete compromise of the application's data and infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin.php/admin.crud/list/name/` endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `name` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's admin interface. They need to be able to send HTTP requests with arbitrary payloads to the vulnerable endpoint and be logged in to the application's backend.
