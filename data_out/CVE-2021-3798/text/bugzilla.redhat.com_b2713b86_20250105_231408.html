| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1990591#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-05 16:55:52 UTC  ``` It was discovered that openCryptoki incorrectly handled certain EC keys. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a invalid curve attack.  Reference: <https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163741/USN-5031-1.txt>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/commit/4e3b43c3d8844402c04a66b55c6c940f965109f0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1990591#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-05 16:56:05 UTC  ``` Created openCryptoki tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1990592](show_bug.cgi?id=1990592 "CLOSED ERRATA - openCryptoki: allows invalid curve attacks via a specially crafted key [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1990591#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-09-10 15:31:55 UTC  ``` As mentioned in the Ubuntu launchpad bug [1] EC support has been introduced in the Soft token with OCK 3.15.0, so this issue only affects openCryptoki versions >= 3.15.0 while earlier openCryptoki releases are not affected. In particular, EC support was introduced through commit [2].  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/opencryptoki/+bug/1928780](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/opencryptoki/%2Bbug/1928780) [2] <https://github.com/opencryptoki/opencryptoki/commit/a179fd01a265a98194d9c06ec5958da1dd2ecae3>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1990591#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-09-13 10:19:59 UTC  ``` In an invalid curve attack, the attacker is able to trick the vulnerable application into using curve points outside of the intended elliptic curve, making it possible to (potentially) extract the private key. A cryptographic library implementing El­lip­tic Curve Cryp­to­gra­phy (ECC) needs to make sure that only valid curve points will be processed, while invalid points are detected and discarded accordingly. This is what openCryptoki's patch aims to do by adding the missing check in fill_ec_key_from_pubkey() and fill_ec_key_from_privkey().   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1990591#c9)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-09-13 13:33:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHBA-2021:3054:  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021:3054](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2021%3A3054)   ``` |  |
