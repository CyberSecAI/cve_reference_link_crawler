### @ifranzki **[ifranzki](/ifranzki)** commented [May 5, 2021](#issue-876533047)

When constructing an OpenSSL EC public or private key from PKCS#11 attributes or ECDH public data, check that the key is valid, i.e. that the point is on the curve.

This prevents one from creating an EC key object via C\_CreateObject with invalid key data. It also prevents C\_DeriveKey to derive a secret using ECDH with an EC public key (public data) that uses a different curve

or is invalid by other means.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This check is also done by `EC_KEY_check_type` as far as I can see in the code. However, since this is not documented (or I just could not find it), I would keep this check here and below.

Right, that was also my thinking when I coded that. `EC_KEY_check_key` should actually also check if the public key point is on the curve, but the documentation does not state that explicitly. So I also thought that its better to leave it in, even if the same thing is checked twice.

### **[ifranzki](/ifranzki)** commented [May 7, 2021](#issuecomment-834124070)

| According to [@p-steuer](https://github.com/p-steuer) `EC_KEY_check_key()` is sufficient, and we should not do an additional `EC_POINT_is_on_curve()` check, since there is a cost associated with doing checking this twice.  I have changed the code accordingly. |
