The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40975.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect order in which devices were unregistered in the `x86_android_tablet_remove()` function within the Linux kernel's x86 platform code. Specifically, devices were being unregistered in the order they were created instead of the reverse order.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the improper device unregistration sequence. This causes a race condition. When a regulator is unregistered while there are still drivers holding a reference to it, a warning (WARN()) is triggered. This primarily affects scenarios involving the regulator subsystem. For example, on certain Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 models, a charger chip's Vbus regulator could be unregistered before its consumer device (a USB switch controlled via I2C).

**Impact of exploitation:**
The direct impact of the vulnerability is not an exploitable code execution or information disclosure, but rather a kernel warning, and potential instability or unexpected behavior. This happens when a regulator is unregistered while still in use, which can lead to unpredictable system behavior and prevent the device from being properly removed.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the device removal process. When the x86_android_tablet device is being removed from the system, the improper unregistration order is triggered causing the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to trigger the device removal process of an affected x86_android_tablet device. This does not require specific privilege but rather a trigger of the device unregistration. This could happen via a device hotplug/unplug event.

**Summary of changes made:**
The fix involves modifying `x86_android_tablet_remove()` to unregister devices in the reverse order of their creation by iterating through the device lists in reverse. This ensures that consumer devices are unregistered before their providers, resolving the race condition that leads to kernel warnings and system instability. The affected device types included are serdev, platform_device, spi_device and i2c_client.
