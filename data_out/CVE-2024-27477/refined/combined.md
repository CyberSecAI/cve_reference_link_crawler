# Leantime-POC

CVE-2024-27474, CVE-2024-27476, CVE-2024-27477

## Description

The following vulnerabilities were identified in version 3.0.6 of the Leantime goals focused project management system.

### CVE-2024-27474

A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability which, when triggered, would create and elevate the privileges of an account to the administrator role.

### CVE-2024-27476

An HTML injection vulnerability which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code, through href attribute or anchor tags, into the application. In my proof-of-concept (POC) I used this to redirect the "victim", otherwise known as myself, to an attacker-controlled login page where they may have their credentials stolen.

### CVE-2024-27477

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which, when triggered, issues a request to a remote server, performing a server-side request forgery attack. This could be leveraged to steal the cookies of any unsuspecting user who visits the page on which it is stored.

## Summary

Leantime is an open-source project, that is a simple yet feature-rich management system for non-project managers. It's version 3.0.6 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability within the ticket creation and modification functionality, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the title field of tickets (also known as To-Dos). In this post, we will dive into this vulnerability and exploit it from an attacker's perspective. Besides the PoC and vulnerability confirmation, the post contains potential attack avenues that an attacker could take. Then we will shift hats and understand the same vulnerability from a source code review, pinpointing the exact code line that caused this issue, and the exact code line that helped fix this issue. Lastly, I leave you with some tips on what mindset to adopt while developing code.
