Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the 'bookisbn' parameter in the `cart.php` resource. The application directly passes user-supplied input from the `bookisbn` parameter to the database query without any filtering or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. User-supplied data is directly incorporated into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `bookisbn` parameter before using it in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL code through this parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database, including user data, book details, pricing information, and potentially other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers could also modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues and potentially compromising the functionality of the application.
- **Denial of Service:** In certain cases, SQL injection can be used to cause a denial-of-service by disrupting the database operations.
- **Complete System Compromise:** A sophisticated attack could potentially escalate the SQL injection into a complete compromise of the underlying server and system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The 'bookisbn' parameter is likely passed through the URL of an HTTP GET request to the `cart.php` script. This makes the attack vector easily accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication or authorization to exploit this vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQLi from the public internet, needing no special privileges within the system.
- **Basic Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests and modify the values of URL parameters to inject malicious SQL code in the `bookisbn` parameter. No specialized hacking tools or skills are explicitly required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code snippets from `cart.php`, `cart_functions.php` and `database_functions.php` confirm the SQL injection point within the `getbookprice()` function in `database_functions.php`, where the `$isbn` variable is directly included into the SQL query without any filtering.
- The CVSSv3.1 score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity level due to the unauthenticated nature of the attack and the potential for high impact.
- The vulnerability is located in the 'Online Book Store Project' version 1.0.
- There is currently no patch available for this vulnerability.

This is a classic example of a SQL injection vulnerability, highlighting the risks of not sanitizing user-supplied input before using it in database queries. The provided information contains more detail than the description available in the official CVE record.
