The provided content relates to CVE-2018-25089.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of `target="_blank"` attribute in HTML links without proper measures to prevent "reverse tabnabbing".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `target="_blank"` attribute allows a newly opened page to potentially access and manipulate the original page through `window.opener`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious page can rewrite the original page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of malicious actions that appear to come from the legitimate website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on a link with `target="_blank"` that leads to a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to control the content of the linked page (the page opened in a new tab/window). They can achieve this by hosting a malicious website or compromising a legitimate one.
- The attacker needs the user to click the crafted malicious link on the original vulnerable web page.

**Mitigation:**
The commit fixes the vulnerability by removing the `target="_blank"` attribute and adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the HTML `<a>` tags. The `noopener` keyword prevents the new tab from accessing the original page using the `window.opener` property. The `noreferrer` keyword is added to prevent the browser from sending the `Referer` header to the new page, further enhancing privacy.
