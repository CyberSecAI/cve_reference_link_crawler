Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `amount` parameter of the `/admin/addgiving.php` file within the Church Management System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `amount` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers could potentially leak sensitive information from the database, including user data and system details.
- **Compromised System Security:** The SQL injection could allow attackers to manipulate data, gain unauthorized access, or execute arbitrary database commands, which could compromise the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/admin/addgiving.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `amount` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft an effective payload.
- **No authentication is mentioned**: However, since the affected file is in the `/admin/` directory, it is likely that the attacker would need to authenticate as an admin to exploit this vulnerability, although this isn't explicitly stated in the description.

**Additional details:**
- The provided payload `amount=0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(8)%2C0))XOR'Z` demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection technique. This payload attempts to make the database sleep for 8 seconds if the condition is true, allowing the attacker to infer information without seeing the output directly.
- The vulnerable version is specified as "â‰¤1.0", meaning version 1.0 and earlier of the Church Management System are affected.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the Church Management System which could result in data leakage and system compromise. An attacker needs to send a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint to exploit it and is likely to require admin access to do so.
