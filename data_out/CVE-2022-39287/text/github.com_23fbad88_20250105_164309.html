|  |  | \_almost\_ a drop-in replacement. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that if you require very specific security needs you may want to |
|  |  | look elsewhere. This library supports encrypting cookies on the client |
|  |  | side to prevent malicious attackers from looking in. It does not |
|  |  | protect against things such as [double submit |
|  |  | cookies](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site\_Request\_Forgery\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie). Those |
|  |  | setups require greater setup and more know-how. This library aims to |
