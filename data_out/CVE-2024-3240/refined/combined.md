# ConvertPlug <= 3.5.25 - Authenticated (Contributor+) PHP Object Injection

| Researcher | [1337\_Wannabe - home](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/researchers/amrawad) |

### Description

The ConvertPlug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.25 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'settings\_encoded' attribute of the 'smile\_info\_bar' shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
