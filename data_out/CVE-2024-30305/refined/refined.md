**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free (UAF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416). This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack vector (AV:L).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- User interaction is required (UI:R) - The user must interact with a malicious file for the exploit to occur, such as opening a specially crafted PDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious PDF file to exploit the vulnerability locally.
