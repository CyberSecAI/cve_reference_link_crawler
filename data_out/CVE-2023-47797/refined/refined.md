- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize the `p_l_back_url_title` parameter on a content page's edit page, allowing injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page which can be used to steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter and convince a user to click on it, leading to the execution of the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and convince a user to click on it. No authentication is required to inject malicious code via this vulnerability.
