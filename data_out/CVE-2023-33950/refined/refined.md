**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of regular expressions vulnerable to ReDoS attacks within the Pattern Redirects feature. This allows an attacker to craft URLs that can cause the server to consume excessive resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The core weakness is the use of inefficient regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing malicious input strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to excessive consumption of server resources (CPU and memory), making the application unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Crafted Request URLs:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted URLs that contain patterns that trigger the vulnerable regular expressions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting Liferay Portal or Liferay DXP.
*   **Low Privileges:**  The attacker only needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**
* Liferay DXP 7.4 update 48 through 76
* Liferay Portal 7.4.3.48 - 7.4.3.76

**Fixed Versions:**
* Liferay DXP 7.4 update 77
* Liferay Portal 7.4.3.77
