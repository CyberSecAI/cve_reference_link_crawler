The provided content relates to a commit in the phpMyFAQ repository, specifically addressing a missing HTML entity conversion. However, it does not contain information about a specific vulnerability identified by a CVE.

The commit message states: "fix: added missing conversion to HTML entities"

Here's what can be extracted:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing HTML entity conversion in the `admin/login.php` file. Specifically, it's related to the `redirect-action` parameter obtained from the query string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The code was vulnerable to a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If the `action` parameter in the query string contained malicious HTML or JavaScript, it would be included in the HTML of the login page without proper sanitization, potentially leading to code execution in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the login page via a crafted URL, resulting in actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious `action` query parameter when accessing the admin login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL and have the victim (admin user) visit that URL.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, other than a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit fixes the vulnerability by applying `Strings::htmlentities()` on the user-supplied `action` parameter. This function ensures that special HTML characters are properly converted into HTML entities, preventing the execution of malicious code.
- The commit only affects the `admin/login.php` file
