{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The spiderpool v0.9.3 and earlier has a clusterRole with `\"*\"` verbs of `\"*\"` resources, granting excessive privileges and violating the principle of least privilege.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control. The clusterRole has overly permissive permissions allowing any operations on all resources within the cluster.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can impersonate the service account bound to the ClusterRole, use its high-risk privileges to list confidential information (Secrets) across the cluster, elevate privileges, and potentially take over the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "1. The attacker steals a token associated with a vulnerable service account.",
    "2. The attacker uses the obtained token to authenticate with the API Server, gaining the privileges of the service account.",
    "3. The attacker uses the privileges to access all Secrets in the cluster.",
    "4. The attacker uses the sensitive information in the Secrets to elevate privileges and explore other sensitive resources, eventually taking over the entire cluster."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to gain access to a token associated with a service account that has the vulnerable ClusterRole. This can be achieved by compromising a worker node and leveraging a pod running on that node to force the spiderpoolâ€™s pod to run on the malicious worker node and steal the token. The attacker then needs the ability to make requests to the Kubernetes API server."
