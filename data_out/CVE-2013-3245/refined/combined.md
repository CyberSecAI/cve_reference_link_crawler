Hello list,
regarding to nonsense VLC post

<http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2013/More-lies-from-Secunia?pub=0#pr>

1.we said that this was a crash, not an exploitable security issue

and funny publication Comment

You forget to mention most important thing: If Secunia Research is
professional, why don't they provide you with working exploit? (in example
EIP = 0x41414141) I'm sure company like VUPEN would do just that to prove
they point. Isn't worth to point out on other sites? (e.g. netsec)
I really like this
<https://twitter.com/Secunia/status/>...<<https://twitter.com/Secunia/status/337140449712156672>>
 you can spot _two_ lies - first they don't find ANY vuln, second their
lying about timeframe.

Here is your VUPEN  0x41414141

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Re: VLC media player MKV Parsing POC

Mario,

As far as I see, the code snippet provided (the only insn) dereferences an
attacker-controlled value. What happens next is not really clear since it
is only one insn in the dump and I am too lazy to actually install VLC and
dig in, but it shows that you can at least control the contents of ECX.

If Kaveh would be so kind as to post the following insns in the stream, we
could see what this may lead to. If the next insn is, say, CALL [EDX+10h],
well, there you go -- you own the control flow.
