| The unused encryption keys, such as the Initial key, should be discarded once QUIC has moved to the Handshake encryption level (<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#name-discarding-unused-keys>), same as the Handshake key after moving to the 1-RTT encryption level. |

| Additional details after this issue has been addressed.  Found in commit [745fd4e](https://github.com/ptrd/kwik/commit/745fd4e2d8d104b9cf1e8342d150ff8967c65892) Fixed in commit [040b0d1](https://github.com/ptrd/kwik/commit/040b0d1327bfb0a8e35c23c2bd612a4a39b721d4)  Vulnerability details: Retention of unused Initial encryption keys in <https://github.com/ptrd/kwik> (commit [745fd4e](https://github.com/ptrd/kwik/commit/745fd4e2d8d104b9cf1e8342d150ff8967c65892)) implementation allows attackers to disrupt a connection (DoS) by sending a CONNECTION\_CLOSE frame that is encrypted using the Initial key computed via network traffic sniffing. This is because the Initial key is not authenticated as explained in <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001.html#name-discarding-initial-keys>.  Exploitation steps:   1. Attackers must be able to sniff the network traffic. 2. Capture the first QUIC packets sent by a QUIC client. 3. Compute the Initial encryption key as described in <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001.html#name-keys> 4. Send a CONNECTION\_CLOSE frame to the server in an initial packet encrypted using the computed initial encryption key. 5. Because the server does not discard the Initial keys, it will decrypt and process the Initial packet sent in (4) even after the QUIC handshake is completed. |
