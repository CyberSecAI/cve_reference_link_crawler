**Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions `SVE-2022-0737(CVE-2022-33694)` and provides a description related to this CVE. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Exposure of sensitive information due to an unprotected intent broadcast in the CSC application.
*   **Weakness:** The CSC application broadcasts Wi-Fi connection information via an intent without proper permission checks.
*   **Impact:** A local attacker can access Wi-Fi information without authorization.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation involves sending an intent to the CSC application to receive the Wi-Fi information.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a local attacker capable of sending intents to the CSC application. The attacker needs to be able to broadcast intent to receive sensitive information

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability stems from the CSC (Customer Service Center) application broadcasting Wi-Fi connection information via an unprotected intent. This lack of access control allows any local application to receive this sensitive data. The vulnerability is described in the following way:
> Exposure of sensitive information in CSC application prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 allows local attacker to access Wi-Fi information via unprotected intent broadcasting.

The fix involves adding the proper permission checks when broadcasting the intent containing sensitive Wi-Fi information. This would prevent unauthorized applications from receiving that information.
> The patch adds proper permission while sending broadcast with sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access.

**Affected Versions:**

The vulnerability affects Samsung devices running Android versions Q(10), R(11), and S(12) prior to the July 2022 Security Maintenance Release (SMR).
