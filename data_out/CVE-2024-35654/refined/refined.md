*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress Responsive Theme, versions 5.0.3 and earlier, contains a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The theme is vulnerable to XSS, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website, which would be executed when visitors access the site.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts. The specific vector is not detailed in this report, but it would likely involve some sort of user input or data that is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered on the webpage.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor", suggesting that an attacker with the ability to contribute content to the WordPress site (or potentially compromise an account with such privileges) would be able to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
