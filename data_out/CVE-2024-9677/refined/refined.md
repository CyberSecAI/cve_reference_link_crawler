- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficiently protected credentials in the CLI command of USG FLEX H series firewalls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient protection of authentication tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can achieve privilege escalation by stealing the authentication token of a logged-in administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: CLI command interface, local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the affected device. The attack requires an administrator to be logged in.
