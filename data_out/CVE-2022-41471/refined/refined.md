The provided content describes a vulnerability in 74cmsSE v3.12.0, which is related to improper permission configuration.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper permission configuration within the 74cmsSE system, allowing low-privileged users to modify the super administrator account's password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control leading to privilege escalation.
- Lack of proper authorization checks before allowing password changes for the super administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged user can change the super administrator's password, effectively taking over the administrator account.
- Complete system compromise.
- Data breaches and unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account within the 74cmsSE system.
- The attacker can use the web interface of 74cmsSE to navigate to the administrator list and change the super administrator password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a valid low-privileged user account created within the system through the "Role rights management" functionality. This account should be assigned a "low rights" role.
- The attacker must have access to the 74cmsSE web interface.
