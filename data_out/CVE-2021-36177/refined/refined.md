- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the FortiAuthenticator HA (High Availability) service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An unauthenticated attacker on the same VLAN as the HA management interface can make a direct connection to the FortiAuthenticator's database. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and lack of proper authentication enforcement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.  The impact is rated as medium severity, with a CVSSv3 score of 4.1, indicating limited impact on confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network or VLAN as the FortiAuthenticator HA management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same VLAN as the HA management interface of the FortiAuthenticator. No authentication is required to connect to the database directly.
