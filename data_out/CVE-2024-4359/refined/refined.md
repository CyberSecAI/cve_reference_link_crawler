Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4359:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient file validation within the `render_svg` function of the "Element Pack Elementor Addons" plugin's SVG widget. Specifically, the plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate the provided file path when rendering an SVG image, leading to arbitrary file read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read the contents of any file on the server. This is due to the lack of validation when processing the file path for the SVG image, allowing an attacker to specify any file path.
- **Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement:**  The vulnerability is classified as a "PHP Remote File Inclusion" issue, which means the plugin improperly handles file paths, allowing an attacker to potentially access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. These files may contain sensitive information such as:
    - Database credentials (in configuration files)
    - Usernames and passwords (in configuration files or other sensitive files)
    - API keys
    - Other sensitive data
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to sensitive information could be leveraged to escalate the attack and gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely.
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Role:** The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable SVG widget and its file path handling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Element Pack Elementor Addons" plugin up to and including 5.7.2.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.7.3.
- The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` link in the wordfence report, points to a changeset, which would suggest a fix for the vulnerability was implemented there.

In summary, CVE-2024-4359 describes a medium-severity vulnerability that allows authenticated users with contributor-level access and above to read sensitive files on the server due to insufficient file validation in the "Element Pack Elementor Addons" plugin's SVG widget.
