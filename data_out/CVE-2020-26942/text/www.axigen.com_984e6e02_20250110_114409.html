# Axigen WebAdmin Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2020-26942)

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to submit a setAdminPassword operation request, subsequently setting a new arbitrary password for the admin account.

## Details

**Affected product(s):**

Axigen 10.3.0.\*, 10.3.1.\*; fixed starting with 10.3.1.27

Axigen 10.3.2.\*. Fixed starting with 10.3.3 (10.3.3.1)

**Vulnerability type:**Authentication bypass

**Affected component(s):**Axigen (through WebAdmin)

**Pre-requisites:** Axigen WebAdmin web interface needs to be exposed; at least one WebAdmin authentication needs to be performed.

**Summary:**This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to submit a setAdminPassword operation request, subsequently setting a new arbitrary password for the admin account.

**Description:** Unauthenticated attackers can submit a setAdminPassword operation request, subsequently setting a new arbitrary password for the admin account. After the initial installation and onboarding are completed and a first authentication in WebAdmin is performed, a request is made to set a new admin password. (This request is done without any authentication, hence the only prerequisite to perform this request is that the WebAdmin portal ie accessible for the attacker.)

**Acknowledgement:** Thomas Vanderhoydonck, Alexander Barakazian and Nabeel Ahmed of NTT Belgium
