# Improper Authentication in PrivateUploader

Critical

[Troplo](/Troplo)
published
GHSA-vhrw-2472-rrjx
Aug 12, 2023

## Package

PrivateUploader
(N/A)

## Affected versions

< 3.2.49

## Patched versions

3.2.49

## Description

### Impact

The admin route controller did not correctly verify whether the user was an administrator (High Level) or moderator (Low Level) causing the request to continue processing. The response would be a 403 with ADMIN\_ONLY, however, next() would call leading to any updates/changes in the route to process.

Despite the authentication bypass, it's unlikely any data was exposed to attackers due to the 403 response which did not contain the original response from the route.

### Patches

You must upgrade to TroploPrivateUploader 3.2.49 or later to mitigate this vulnerability. A patched version can be obtained via GitHub, or Docker Hub depending on your setup.

### Workarounds

You may manually patch the app/routes/v3/admin.controller.ts file and rebuild with the latest HighLevel and LowLevel classes in commit [869657d](https://github.com/Flowinity/Flowinity/commit/869657d61e3c7a518177106fe63ea483082b0d3e), however upgrading is highly recommended.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
