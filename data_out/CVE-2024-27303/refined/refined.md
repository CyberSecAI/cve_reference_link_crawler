Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-27303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The NSIS installer, used by `electron-builder` on Windows, executes `cmd.exe` via `NSExec` within the installer script (.nsh).
- `NSExec` searches for the executable in the current directory (where the installer is located) before looking in the system's `PATH`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal/Uncontrolled Search Path:** The installer's reliance on the current directory as the primary search path for `cmd.exe` creates a vulnerability, which is related to CWE-426 and CWE-427. This is because, an attacker can place a malicious `cmd.exe` in the same directory as the installer.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious `cmd.exe` in the same directory as the installer, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities such as malware installation, data theft, system compromise etc.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the nature of the malicious code, this could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to place a malicious `cmd.exe` in the same directory as the installer. This typically requires some level of access to the target system or distribution mechanism.
- **User Interaction Required:** The victim user needs to execute the installer for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs some way to place the malicious `cmd.exe` file in the same directory as the installer. This might involve social engineering, compromising a distribution channel or if a user with local access downloads and runs the malicious installer.
- **Knowledge of installer execution:** The attacker needs to know the context of the NSIS installer execution to leverage this vulnerability.
- **Low privileges are sufficient:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Windows-based systems using the NSIS installer.
- The fix involves explicitly calling `cmd.exe` from `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32` to prevent the attacker from hijacking it.
- The vulnerability exists at the installer level itself and there are no user-level workarounds.
- The vulnerability was reported by "bruno-1337".
