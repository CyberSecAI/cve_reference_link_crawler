Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-26129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect checks on the sub-TLV length within the `parse_hello_subtlv`, `parse_ihu_subtlv`, and `parse_update_subtlv` functions in `babeld/message.c`. Specifically, the code incorrectly calculates and validates the remaining data length when parsing sub-TLVs (Type-Length-Value).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Loop Condition Checks:** The code uses `i + 1 > alen` or `i + len > alen` for boundary checks, which allows for out-of-bounds reads. The correct checks should be `i + 1 >= alen` and `i + len + 2 > alen` respectively, which accounts for the type and length bytes.
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** Due to the incorrect checks, the code can attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer when accessing `a[i + 1]` to retrieve the length and when processing the sub-TLV data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** By sending a crafted Babel packet with specific sub-TLV lengths, an attacker can trigger out-of-bounds reads. Although the provided text discusses assertion failures, the underlying condition is a buffer overflow. 
- **Denial of Service:** As a result of the out-of-bounds read, the application can crash due to assertion failures, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly detailed, buffer overflows can sometimes be exploited for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted network packets sent to the Babel daemon (`babeld`).
- **Sub-TLVs:** Attackers manipulate the length fields within sub-TLVs of Babel messages to exploit the length check errors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a vulnerable system running the `babeld` daemon.
- **Babel Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of the Babel protocol's structure and sub-TLV format to craft malicious messages.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was addressed in FRRouting by fixing the boundary checks.
- The initial reports suggested assertion failures due to the out-of-bounds reads, but those were due to safety checks preventing further exploitation.
- The vulnerability was initially given a severity score of 7.8, which was later questioned due to the assertion failures. However, the underlying condition was still a buffer overflow vulnerability.
- The fix involved modifying the conditions from `i + 1 > alen` to `i + 1 >= alen` and from `i + len > alen` to `i + len + 2 > alen`.

The vulnerability is present in FRRouting versions up to 8.1.0, and was fixed in later versions.
