# Issue with DeepJavaLibrary

Critical

[tosterberg](/tosterberg)
published
GHSA-w877-jfw7-46rj
Jun 17, 2024

## Package

api.jar
(DJL)

## Affected versions

< 0.27.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

## Summary

DeepJavaLibrary(DJL) versions 0.1.0 through 0.27.0 do not prevent absolute path archived artifacts from inserting archived files directly into the system, overwriting system files. This is fixed in DJL 0.28.0 and patched in DJL Large Model Inference containers 0.27.0.

**Impacted versions: 0.1.0 through 0.27.0**

## Patches

Patched Deep Learning Containers:

[v1.1-djl-0.27.0-inf-cpu-full](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.1-djl-0.27.0-inf-cpu-full)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
