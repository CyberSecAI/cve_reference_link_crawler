The provided content is related to CVE-2024-37902.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DeepJavaLibrary (DJL) versions 0.1.0 through 0.27.0 do not properly handle absolute paths within archived artifacts. This allows an attacker to insert files directly into the system, potentially overwriting existing system files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of validation or sanitization of file paths within archived artifacts.
-  Insecure handling of absolute paths during extraction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite on the system where DJL is running.
- Potential for complete system compromise if critical system files are overwritten.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Maliciously crafted archived artifacts containing files with absolute paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted archived artifact to DJL for processing. This could be via a network service or other means.
- The attacker does not require any privileges on the system.
- No user interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered.
