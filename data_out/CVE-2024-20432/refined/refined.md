- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability in the REST API and web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the CLI of a Cisco NDFC-managed device with *network-admin* privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Submitting crafted commands to an affected REST API endpoint or through the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
