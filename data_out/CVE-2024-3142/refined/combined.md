## Overview

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

## Description

The CSRF vulnerability detected in the Clavister E80 and E10 firewall systems allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users, leading to unintended actions such as rebooting or resetting the firewall. By crafting a malicious link or embedding it within a legitimate website, attackers can deceive users into unknowingly executing unauthorized actions, ultimately compromising the security and integrity of the network.
A successful attack could result in Unauthorized firewall reboots or resets, leading to disruption of network traffic and services

## POC

This vulnerability was discovered in the (Clavister E10 and E80 ) Firewall at Reset endpoint **"/?Page=Reset"**

As example we created a form to simulate a typical HTTP request for the **/?restart=full&Page=ResetAction** endpoint in order to use it in our proof of concept.

Because the application does not validate the request, if any authenticated user clicks on that button, the application accepts the request and the user cookies are sent through the request to the **"/htdocs/pages/base/sys reset.lsp"** endpoint, causing the Firewall to reboot.

The same method will be used in order to create a CSRF POC in order to Reset all Firewall configurations at **/?reset=factoryreset&Page=ResetAction** endpoint.

* Updated GeoIP and Ethernet Vendor Databases

  The GeoIP and Ethernet vendor databases have been updated to the latest releases.

## 2.3. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.14

* OpenID Connect for OneConnect

  This release adds support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) for OneConnect VPN. OpenID Connect is a
  decentralized authentication protocol which removes the need to handle passwords. Clavister's
  OneConnect clients for Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS and Android support OpenID Connect. Clavister
  recommends using PhenixID Authentication Server and the OneTouch mobile application.
* High Availability Support for OneConnect

  OneConnect client information is now state synchronized betwen the cluster nodes.
* Logs With Link to the Log Reference Guide

  The memory log pages in the web user interface now contain a link to the online version of the log
  reference guide. Clicking on a log ID opens the description for that log ID in a new tab in the web
  browser.
* ACME HA Support

  High Availability Support for ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment), used for
  automating retrieval of Let's Encrypt and Buypass certificates in cOS Core, has been added.
* Naming of Interfaces When Using Cloud-Init

  Cloud-Init uses the field ID in network\_data.json file to set the interface name (and corresponding
  address objects). If the original naming of the interfaces instead should be used, that is now
  possible. By adding the tag '#no\_iface\_rename' in the "user\_data" file, interface renaming
  will be overridden and the names will be left untouched.
* User Groups for OneConnect

  A "User Groups" setting has been added to the OneConnect interface to make it possible to
  specify the User Groups a user must be member of to log in. After successful authentication against
  the configured authentication source, the returned User Group or Groups are matched against the
  configured User Groups on the OneConnect interface. If the user is not a member of any of the
  configured Groups, login will be disallowed. If the OneConnect interface User Groups field is empty,
  no User Group matching will be performed.
* SNMPv3 EngineID

  The SNMPv3 EngineID can now be shown using the "snmp" CLI command.
* Updated GeoIP Database

  The GeoIP database has been updated to the latest release.

## 2.4. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.13

* Simplified Configuration of ACME (Let's Encrypt)

  Support for an additional verification method has been added when using ACME. The new more user
  friendly method does not need a reverse proxy policy to be configured, and might be more suitable
  for installations that do not protect a web server.
* Updated VLAN CLI Command

  The "vlan" CLI command output has been updated. The new format can show the full VLAN
  interface name (up to the allowed max length), displays a longer part of the base interface name and
  follows the output format of other CLI commands better. A "verbose" flag has also been
  added, which lists zone and PBR table membership.
* Anti-Virus Database Size

  A setting has been added where the administrator can reduce the number of signatures that cOS Core
  will use from the Anti-Virus database. Possible entries are 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%.
* DHCP Client Shutdown Event

  The shutdown event (log and CLI message) when a reconfigure is triggered by a new DHCP lease now
  contains the name of the interface that received the new lease.
* System Notification for High Availability

  The system will now log, output to the CLI and show a notification in the web user interface when
  the two High Availability nodes are running different firmware versions.
* Support for Uploading Certificate Chains

  When uploading a certificate file that contains a chain (more than one certificate), cOS Core now
  inserts all certificates as separate objects in the key ring. The name of the certificates after the
  lead node will be followed by "\_C#", where # is the certificate order counting from the
  lead. Example WebServer, WebServer\_C1, WebServer\_C2.
* Improved Error Message

  The error message describing problems with Shared HA IPv4 address has been updated to contain
  interface name and address.
* Reduced Mode Status in InControl

  InControl can now check if a firewall has been put into reduced mode.
* Updated ACME CLI Commands

  The output of the "acme" CLI command has been updated to better match other CLI commands.
* Upgraded TLS/SSL Library

  The embedded TLS/SSL library has been updated to the latest version.
* Warning Added for SHA1

  A warning has been added for users that still use SHA1 in their IPsec configuration, since the
  algorithm is no-longer considered safe.
* New Application Control Library

## 2.5. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.12

* ACME and Let's Encrypt (BETA)

  Many find working with certificates complicated. We are therefore happy to introduce support for the
  ACME protocol in cOS Core. The ACME protocol can be used to automatically create and update
  certificates. One well known certificate provider that uses the ACME protocol is Let's Encrypt. With
  this new beta feature an administrator can quite easily get a free and trusted Let's Encrypt
  certificate (a chain of three certificates) that can be used by OneConnect VPN, IKEv2 Roaming VPN
  (Simplified), the TLS ALG, the Reverse Proxy, and the Admin web user interface etc. In this version
  the administrator needs to configure a reverse proxy to handle the certificate verification process.
  The received certificate chain will be available as usual in the key ring. Future versions will
  extend ACME support.
* Linktest Command for Network Investigation

  This release adds the "linktest" CLI command. Linktest enables simple network
  troubleshooting towards NDT7 servers over HTTP and HTTPS as well as custom web servers. Please note
  that linktest is not a test of the network speed, but a diagnostic tool to check network
  functionality. More details can be found in the Administration Guide.
* Improved Interface Statistics

  A new option has been added to the "ifstat" CLI command to show low level interface
  statistics. Typing "ifstat -extend" will show information that could be useful in
  troubleshooting scenarios. The change is available on the NetWall 100, 300, 500 and 6000 Series, as
  well as in 64bit versions for VMware and KVM.
* Admin Control of OneConnect TCP Only Mode

  OneConnect clients communicate with cOS Core using a Control Channel via TLS and a Data Channel via
  DTLS. Bulk data is sent via the Data Channel efficiently with the drawback that it is easier to
  detect and block DTLS. The Control Channel is also able to tunnel data but less efficiently. Data
  sent over the Control Channel has the advantage that it is cloaked as ordinary HTTPS traffic. This
  feature makes it possible to disable the data channel from the admin interface, forcing clients to
  use TCP only mode.
* Upgraded Crypto Library

  The embedded TLS/SSL library has been updated to the latest version.
* Security Advisory

  Older insecure DH groups have been marked with "avoid" in IPsec tunnel configuration in
  the web user interface.
* Rule Details in the REST API

  New REST endpoints, which show the most important information about the rules in the system, have
  been added. For IP Rules, the information includes the source interface, source network, destination
  network, service, action and target ruleset for goto rules. Pipe rules, routing rules, threshold
  rules and IDP rules do not list action, but otherwise contain the same information. The new
  endpoints can be used together with the usage endpoints to get a more detailed picture without
  having to also parse the configuration. For details, see the REST API Guide.
* New Application Control Library

  + VPN

    - ec\_tunnel\_vpn (EC Tunnel Pro VPN)
    - softether\_vpn (SoftEther VPN)
* License and SECaaS Status in the REST API

  It is now possible to get the some of the details of the installed license over the REST API. The
  information includes end dates for the license and subscriptions like Tech support, Antivirus, Web
  Content Filtering and so on. If the installed license is a SECaaS license (subscription based
  license) the current status will also be shown (similar to the information shown in the CLI).
* Hardware Sensor Status in the REST API

  Values from hardware sensors used for Hardware Monitoring can now be retrieved using the REST API.

## 2.6. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.11

* ECDSA Signed Certificates

  Support for certificates signed with elliptic curve algorithms has been added for use in IPsec
  tunnels.
* IPsec: Support for Diffie-Hellman Group (DH) 31

  The list of algorithms supported for DH and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) in IPsec has been extended
  to include support for the Curve25519 algorithm, DH group 31.
* SLB Maintenance Mode Over the REST API

  In previous versions it was possible to set SLB servers in maintenance mode using the REST API, but
  only if the distribution method "resource usage" was used. Now servers can be set in
  maintenance mode over REST for all distribution methods. Note that ServerID needs to be set.
* System Error Reports and InControl

  When used together with InControl 3.16.00 or later, system error reports from the 100, 300, 500 and
  6000 Series can now be downloaded to InControl.

* Updated GeoIP and Ethernet Vendor Databases

  The GeoIP and Ethernet vendor databases have been updated to the latest releases.

## 2.7. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.10

* Reverse Proxy

  The system can now act as a reverse proxy for web servers using HTTP and HTTPS. The reverse proxy is
  configured as a new type of policy in the rule list. The proxy can handle HTTP->HTTP,
  HTTPS->HTTPS and HTTPS->HTTP, meaning that the firewall handles the decryption offloading the
  web server.

  Reverse Proxy requires Enhanced subscription or higher.
* Blacklist for Reverse Proxy

  The Reverse Proxy has been extended with the possibility to blacklist URLs, giving the administrator
  the possibility to block certain URLs from external access.
* IPsec: Support for More Diffie-Hellman Groups (DH)

  The list of algorithms supported for DH and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) in IPsec has been extended
  to include support for Brainpool algorithms, DH group 28, 29 and 30.
* Rule Usage in the REST API

  Support for polling rule usage (number of times a rule has triggered) has been added to the REST
  API. The output is similar to the "rules" CLI command. Rule usage for the main IP ruleset,
  additional rulesets, IDP rules, threshold rules, pipe rules and routing rules can be polled. See the
  REST API guide for paths and more details.
* New Application Control Library

  The Application Library has been updated to version 1.650. Major additions/updates:

* Updated Default IPsec Configurations

  The proposal lists for existing IPsec Simplified Roaming, Simplified LAN to LAN and Azure VPN types
  have been updated to include the new DH Groups (19-21) and AES-GCM. New IPsec tunnels will also have
  new algorithms selected by default. Existing IPsec tunnels will not be changed, but Clavister
  recommends all customers to update their IPsec Tunnel configuration, IKE Algorithms and IPsec
  Algorithm settings to include DH Group 19-21, 28-30 and AES-GCM. DH Groups below 15 are not
  recommended.
* Reconnect of OneConnect Clients

  When used together with version 3.5.1 or later of the OneConnect Client for macOS, iOS, iPadOS and
  Android, cOS Core allows OneConnect sessions to be restarted without the need for re-authentication
  if the session is re-established within two minutes. This gives an improved end-user experience when
  for example moving from WIFI to 4G/5G.
* Polling of active DHCP Server Leases in the REST API

  Support for polling active DHCP Server leases has been added to the REST API. Active leases for a
  specific DHCP server or all DHCP servers can be listed. When listing a specific server, additional
  statistics such as pool usage will be included. See the REST API guide for path and more details.
* Updated GeoIP Database

  The GeoIP database has been updated to the latest release.

## 2.8. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.09

* New IPsec Algorithm

  The encryption algorithm AES-GCM can now be used in IKE (IKEv2 only) and IPsec.
* Support for ECDH Groups 19-21

  Support has been added for using IPsec tunnels with Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) groups 19,
  20 and 21.
* OneConnect Client Information Log

  Client information is logged to configured log receivers when OneConnect client is connecting,
  before user authentication. The logged information is device ID
  (Windows/macOS/iOS/Android/Chromebook), client version, OS version, OS architecture and a UID. The
  UID is an ID unique for each installation of OneConnect client. Windows clients also send
  information if Antivirus is enabled and if Antivirus signatures are up to date.
* Traffic Shaping Status Page

  A new status page has been added in the Web User Interface, showing the status of configured traffic
  shaping pipes. The page provides the same information as the existing CLI command.
* Extended URL Filter Redirect with Tag Support

  The URL Filter now allows populating the resulting URL with dynamic information from client and
  server using predefined tags.
* Renamed IPv6 Log

## 2.10. New Features and Enhancements in cOS Core 14.00.07

* Application-based Policies and Routing

  Support for routing connections based on the identified protocol or application has been added to
  the IP Policies. By leveraging a technique called First Packet Inspection the firewall can make routing
  decisions based on the first packet arriving.

  Since the routing decision needs to be taken on the first packet of the connection,
  only a subset of the applications supported by Application Control can be used.
* Simplified Migration Tool for IP Rule to IP Policy

  It is now possible to migrate old IP Rules to corresponding IP Policy using a simplified converter from a menu alternative
  in the data-grid. The automatic conversion can only be done for a limited number of IP Rule types.
  Supported IP Rule Types:

  + Allow
  + Drop
  + Reject
  + NAT

  Note, the old rule is not automatically deleted in the conversion. The administrator needs to delete
  the old IP Rule after reviewing that the changes in the ruleset produce the same end result.
* Spam Sources Added to Threat Prevention

  Protection against spam sources has been added to Threat Prevention. It uses IP Reputation data to
  block and blacklist IPs that have been categorized as sources for spam.

## Chapter 3: Addressed Issues

The following sections detail the addressed issues in Clavister
cOS Core 14.00.16 release.

## 3.1. Addressed Issues in cOS Core 14.00.16

* **COP-24882:**
  Fix for the Blast-RADIUS protocol vulnerability. The vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle
  attacker to forge a valid protocol accept message. To enable the new behavior, enable "Require
  Message-Authenticator" on the RADIUS Server object in cOS Core. Upgraded configurations will
  not have the setting enabled, it should be enabled at the same time as when the mitigation is
  enabled on the RADIUS Server. New configurations will have the setting enabled by default.
* **COP-24883:**
  The system could restart unexpectedly during reconfiguration on systems configured with OSPF and
  static OSPF Neighbors.
* **COP-24573:**
  The system could restart unexpectedly due to an error in the IDP subsystem.
* **COP-24778:**
  The license page did not correctly trigger restart or reconfiguration after completion. The license
  page now correctly restarts or reconfigures the firewall after a license upload.
* **COP-24801:**
  The Reverse Proxy blacklist could in some circumstances allow blacklisted URLs.
* **COP-24836:**
  Detection of overlapping Interface Groups and Zones for "Security Equivalent" was not
  always correct.
* **COP-24890:**
  The system restarted unexpectedly when the OSPF system failed to allocate memory either due to
  exceeding available system memory or maximum allowed OSPF memory.

## 3.2. Addressed Issues in cOS Core 14.00.15

* **COP-24509:**
  The information in the "updatecenter -servers" CLI command was not clear on packet loss details. The command now shows
  both how many packets that have been sent and how many that were lost.
* **COP-24654:**
  Setting up a firewall to use ZeroTouch could on rare occasions fail in versions 14.00.11, 14.00.12, 14.00.13 and
  14.00.14. As a quick workaround, the firewall could be reset to factory defaults or upgraded to 14.00.15 or later.
* **COP-24779:**
  The DHCP Client did, in some situations, not correctly handle leases where the lease IP and lease gateway were the same
  IP address.
* **COP-24798:**
  The OIDC discovery was aborted after 4 retries. The discovery method is now changed to continue forever with
  exponential increase in time up to 24h delay between each retry.
* **COP-24829:**
  The system could not download OIDC Discovery information causing authentication with OIDC as Authentication Source to
  fail.
* **COP-24167:**
  The IPsec tunnel settings "IKEIPsecPerIKELimit" and "IKEMaxIPsecPerIKELimitViolation" were not used by the IPsec engine.
  These settings are only available from the CLI and only on the IPsec Tunnel, i.e. not on any of the simplified VPN
  tunnels.
* **COP-24429:**
  An FQDN address object could under rare conditions not get the IP address until an HA failover was performed.
* **COP-24771:**
  The SMTP protocol handler did not properly save the "Failed" statistical data counter during reconfiguration causing the
  value to be reset.
* **COP-24776:**
  The "type" column was not shown in the CLI when viewing the IP Policy/Rules configuration making it hard to distinguish
  them from each other. The view has been updated to correctly show the type.
* **COP-24787:**
  The help text for the DHCPv6 client "preferred lease time" was incorrectly referring to seconds when it should be
  minutes.

## 3.3. Addressed Issues in cOS Core 14.00.14

* **COP-24150:**
  In older versions of Chrome, there was a problem to log in to HTTPS Web User Interface management due to the way
  certificates were treated by the browser.
* **COP-24707:**
  The system could in certain scenarios restart unexpectedly during reconfiguration, after changes to multiple interfaces.
* **COP-24733:**
  Traffic inside an IPsec tunnel using the encryption algorithm AES-GCM was dropped if Integrity Algorithm proposal "None"
  was received during a tunnel negotiation.
* **COP-23704:**
  In the event of an error, the High Availability (HA) wizard would not finish but also would not show any error message
  to the user.
* **COP-22715:**
  The list of additional seen DHCPv6 offers in the "dhcpv6" CLI command was unaligned. The table width has been increased
  and a max size has been set for each column. If the address is longer than allowed, it will be cut.
* **COP-24701:**
  The HTTP ALG could sometime fail to parse the SNI name from HTTPS ClientHello. The parser has been updated to handle SNI
  names correctly.
* **COP-24711:**
  The icon indicating Geolocation filter in the WebUI datagrid could sometimes overlap with the text. The rendering has
  been updated to correctly truncate the text if overlap was going to happen.
* **COP-24712:**
  On the Interface Status page in the Web User Interface, the private IP address was written twice for HA setups. The
  shared IP is now correctly written within parentheses.
* **COP-24734:**
  Responses to ACME challenges would in some cases be done twice for a request.

## 3.4. Addressed Issues in cOS Core 14.00.13

* **COP-24494:**
  The system could on some rare occasions restart unexpectedly due to an error in the Web Content
  Filtering subsystem.
* **COP-24500:**
  The system sometimes restarted unexpectedly when using OneConnect. Affected models: 300, 500 and
  6000 Series.
* **COP-24551:**
  The system could on rare occasions restart unexpectedly when polling statistical values. Affected
  models: 100, 300, 500 and 6000 Series.
* **COP-24552:**
  The firewall could on rare occasions restart unexpectedly due to an error in OneConnect.
* **COP-24658:**
  IPsec tunnel negotiation failed when the integrity algorithm "none" was used together with
  AES-GCM cipher.
* **COP-24343:**
  VLANs would not work in some virtual environments when using 64 bit cOS Core.
* **COP-24626:**
  Cloud-init could fail when network MTU was set to null or an invalid value.
* **COP-24627:**
  Cloud-init failed if the system name contained a space character.
* **COP-22227:**
  The log messages "fragments\_available\_freeing" (02000100) and
  "fragact\_contains\_frags" (02000002) had severity level "critical". Both have now
  been lowered to severity level "warning". The revisions of the two messages have been
  increased by one as a result of the correction.
* **COP-23634:**
  It was not possible to remove a license permanently when using subscription-based licenses on
  virtual installations of cOS Core.
* **COP-24372:**
  When deploying a configuration using InControl to an active node in an HA cluster the local
  configuration version should remain the same but could in some cases incorrectly be increased,
  causing an alarm in InControl to be set.
* **COP-24402:**
  A closing or failed OneConnect session was sometimes left open for an unnecessary long time.
* **COP-24589:**
  The log messages "failed\_to\_link\_ike\_and\_userauth" (01803300) and
  "failed\_to\_find\_userauthobject\_for\_ipsec\_sa" (01803302) contained a misspelled word. The
  revisions of the two messages have been increased by one as a result of the correction.
* **COP-24591:**
  The setting Security/Transport Equivalent on a Zone did not work as expected.
* **COP-24596:**
  The web user interface pages for Threshold Rules and Pipe Rules were not aligned with other Rule and
  Policy pages in the Filter section.
* **COP-24604:**
  With the addition of the CLI command for ACME, it was no-longer possible to use the short form
  "ac" of the activate command for the activate and commit procedure. The abbreviation
  "ac" has now been added as an alias for activate.
* **COP-24608:**
  ACME could sometimes start its process on the activate command, i.e. before commit was issued. This
  has now been changed to always start only after the commit command.
* **COP-24633:**
  Download of system error reports to InControl could in some rare scenarios fail.
* **COP-24634:**
  The CA Path Length Constraint could be set to an incorrect value when generating a certificate.
* **COP-24644:**
  An IPsec tunnel using AES-GCM was sometimes closed after an HA failover.

## 3.5. Addressed Issues in cOS Core 14.00.12

* **COP-24350:**
  Using a Multicast Policy, it was not possible to forward the same multicast group in a
  bi-directional fashion. cOS Core only had the notion of a multicast group; either being
  "joined" (requested from the source) at a given interface, or "queried"
  (verified that there are any listeners). This was partially due to design, as this is the only
  scenario supported by the original IGMP specification. As an extension, cOS Core will now handle the
  same group both; being "joined" and "queried" at the same interface. Note that
  IGMP "querier election" will have to be disabled in order to make this useful.
* **COP-24489:**
  Reverse Proxy could in some High Availability subsystems cause an unexpected restart.
* **COP-24364:**
  Certain traffic patterns with a high number of connections with the same IP and port inside an IPsec
  tunnel generated higher CPU load than expected.
* **COP-24506:**

## Chapter 4: Installation Instructions

## 4.1. Upgrade Considerations

This section covers considerations to take into account when upgrading to the latest cOS Core version,
such as configuration aspects related to changes in features or behavior of the system after upgrade.

* Centralized Management via InControl

  When using InControl for Centralized management, make sure the latest version of InControl is used
  to ensure the best experience and compatibility.

## 4.2. Upgrading From a cOS Core 10.nn, 11.nn, 12.nn or 13.nn System

This section describes how to upgrade the system using
the Web User Interface. For a detailed description on how to upgrade
the system using SCP please refer to the Clavister cOS Core admin guide.

To upgrade Clavister cOS Core using the Web user interface, follow these simple steps:

* Browse to the Web User Interface and log in as a user with full administrative rights.
* From the "Maintenance" menu select "Backup & Restore".
* Click the "Backup Configuration" button and save the file.
* From the "Maintenance" menu select "Upgrade".
* Click the "Browse..." button and select the .upg file which contains the upgrade.
* Click the "Upload firmware image" button to upload the image and start the upgrade procedure.
* When the file has been uploaded to the gateway, the message "Firmware upload complete." will be presented and the system will
  restart.
* When the system has been restarted the login screen will appear and the system upgrade is complete.

## Chapter 5: Known Limitations

* Generation of certificates using 4096 bit size stalls firewall
  If bit size 4096 is chosen when generating certificates in the Web User Interface, the firewall will be unavailable
  for a short period of time with no progress indicator during this time. Affected versions: 12.00.17 and newer.
* High Availability: Transparent Mode does not work in HA mode.
  There is no state synchronization for Transparent Mode and there is no
  loop avoidance.
* High Availability: (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) PPPoE is not supported in HA mode.
* High Availability: No state synchronization for Application Layer Gateways.
  No aspect of Application Layer Gateways are state synchronized.

  This means that all traffic handled by ALGs will freeze when the cluster
  fails over to the other peer. If, however, the cluster fails back over
  to the original peer within approximately half a minute, frozen sessions
  (and associated transfers) should begin working again.
  Note that such failover (and consequent fallback) occurs each time a new
  configuration is uploaded.
* High Availability: Tunnels unreachable from inactive node.
  The inactive node in an HA cluster cannot communicate over IPsec, SSL VPN, OneConnect, Open Connect, PPTP, L2TP
  and GRE tunnels, as such tunnels are established to/from the active node.

  + Inactive HA member cannot send log events over tunnels.
  + Inactive HA member cannot be managed / monitored over tunnels.
  + OSPF: If the cluster members do not share a broadcast interface so that
    the inactive node can learn about OSPF state, OSPF failover over tunnels
    uses normal OSPF failover rather than accelerated (<1s) failover. This
    means 20-30 seconds with default settings, and 3-4 seconds with more
    aggressively tuned OSPF timings.
* High Availability: No state synchronization for L2TP, PPTP, and SSL VPN tunnels.
  There is no state synchronization for L2TP, PPTP and SSL VPN tunnels.
  On failover, incoming clients will re-establish their tunnels
  after the tunnels are deemed non-functional. This timeout is
  typically in the 30-120 seconds range.
* High Availability: No state synchronization for IDP signature scan states.
  No aspects of the IDP signature states are synchronized. This means that there is a small chance that the IDP engine causes
  false negatives during an HA failover.

## Chapter 6: Compatibility

The following section outlines the direct compatibility considerations as
of cOS Core 14.00.16.

The following hardware appliances are supported as of the Clavister cOS Core 14.00.16 release. Clavister
does not guarantee compatibility with other hardware appliances.
