# Oxygen 4.9 Now Available

hello world!

Today we're excited to announce the release of Oxygen 4.9.

Oxygen 4.9 introduces the new right-click context menu and some new options for the Advanced Query builder.

We're also releasing Oxygen Elements for WooCommerce 2.0.1 alongside this, with one minor fix for the Archive Title element and a licensing check fix.

## Right-click Context Menu

The new right-click context menu is a huge quality of life upgrade, allowing you to easily manipulate elements and access their settings with fewer clicks.

![](https://oxygenbuilder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/contextmenu.png)

The available options in the dropdown menu include: copy, paste, duplicate, delete, rename, and export. Additionally, you can instantly access an element's conditions, hide the element, make it re-usable, or wrap it with a div from the context menu.

## Advanced Query Upgrades

New in the Advanced Query builder for loop elements, you can create complex orderby parameters with multiple properties, just like using WP\_Query directly.

Additionally, Advanced Query now also supports arbitrary, custom query parameters. This can be useful for advanced setups or specific integrations.

Oxygen 4.9 is now available as an in-place update, or you can download it directly from https://oxygenbuilder.com/portal.

Below is a mostly complete changelog of the changes made in Oxygen 4.9.

### Description

The Oxygen Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the oxy\_save\_css\_from\_admin AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update stylesheets.
