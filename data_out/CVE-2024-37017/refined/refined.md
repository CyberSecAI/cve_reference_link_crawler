{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `MD_to_TimedText_TDesc` function within the `ASDCP::TimedText::MXFReader::h__Reader` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to application crashes, data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and system instability.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted MXF file with asdcplib's `asdcp-info` or `asdcp-unwrap` binaries.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MXF file that triggers the vulnerable code path. The attacker would need to execute the asdcplib library's tool to parse the malicious file."

  "additional_details": {
    "affected_software": "asdcplib version 2.13.1",
    "operating_system": "Debian 11 with Linux kernel 5.10.0-28-amd64",
    "reproduction_steps": [
      "Build asdcplib with AddressSanitizer enabled.",
      "Execute `asdcp-info` or `asdcp-unwrap` with the provided proof-of-concept (POC) file.",
      "Observe the AddressSanitizer report indicating a heap-buffer-overflow error."
