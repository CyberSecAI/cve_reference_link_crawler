| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c0)  Marian Rehak    2021-06-14 13:53:01 UTC  ``` A race condition occurs between bcm_release() and bcm_rx_handler(). When a message is received in bcm_rx_handler(), the socket can be closed in bcm_release() which will free the struct bcm_sock and struct bcm_op. This leads to various use-after-free's in bcm_rx_handler() and depending on the provided flags, also in bcm_rx_timeout_handler(). The use-after-free's in combination with a heap spray may lead to sensitive socket data being overwritten, resulting in local privilege escalation.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c1)  Petr Matousek    2021-06-21 15:25:18 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1974405](show_bug.cgi?id=1974405 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3609 kernel: race condition in net/can/bcm.c leads to local privilege escalation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c2)  Petr Matousek    2021-06-21 15:52:08 UTC  ``` Proposed upstream fix:  [https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210619161813.2098382-1-cascardo@canonical.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20210619161813.2098382-1-cascardo%40canonical.com/)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c5)  Marian Rehak    2021-06-22 07:20:38 UTC  ``` Reference:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/19/1>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-10 11:13:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:3044 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3044](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3044)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-10 13:08:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:3088 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3088](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3088)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-10 13:14:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:3057 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3057](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3057)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1971651#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-08-10 13:28:55 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
