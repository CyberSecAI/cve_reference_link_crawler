The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-40560) found in the Tmall_demo project, along with an unauthorized access issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `orderUtil.orderBy` parameter is used in the SQL query within `mybatis/mapper/RewardMapper.xml` without proper sanitization, allowing for SQL injection through parameter concatenation.
-  An access control flaw in the filter permits unauthorized access to backend interfaces if the URL contains `/admin/login` or `/admin/account`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input (`orderBy` parameter) in SQL queries.
-  Lack of proper authentication/authorization for backend interfaces, allowing unauthorized access to these interfaces.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Successful SQL injection can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the entire application database.
-  Unauthorized access to backend interfaces allows attackers to bypass authentication checks and potentially execute administrative functions or access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The SQL injection vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP requests by manipulating the `orderBy` parameter in the URL.
- The unauthorized access vulnerability can be exploited by crafting requests with URLs that include `/admin/login` or `/admin/account` allowing bypass of authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No prior authentication or authorization is required due to the authentication bypass issue.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including code snippets showing the vulnerable locations, and a proof-of-concept (POC) using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the exploit.
