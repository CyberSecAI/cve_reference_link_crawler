- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Quicksand Post Filter jQuery Plugin, in versions up to 3.1.1, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that is triggered by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
