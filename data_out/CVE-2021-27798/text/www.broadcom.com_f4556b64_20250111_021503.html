**Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2022-2012

Component : Brocade Fabric OS

Revision : 1.1: Final**

Brocade has received a report from Black Lantern Security of a potential Privileged Directory Traversal vulnerability on Brocade Fabric OS: v7.4.1b, v7.3.1d stating that:

â€œFrom within the restricted shell environment (rbash) as either the â€œuserâ€ or â€œfactoryâ€ account, it is possible to access and list the entirety of the filesystem utilizing the â€œmoreâ€ binary and tab-completion.

This appears to be with root equivalent permissions regardless of who you are logged in asâ€.

**The detail provided by the Researcher**.

* From within the restricted shell environment (rbash) as either the â€œuserâ€ or â€œfactoryâ€ account, it is possible to access and list the entirety of the filesystem utilizing the â€œmoreâ€ binary and tab-completion. This appears to be with root equivalent permissions regardless of who you are logged in as.
* To reproduce, in an active SSH session with the affected software, type the command â€œmoreâ€ and press the TAB key until a listing of the current directory is given. Supplying partial paths such as â€œmore /â€ or â€œmore /etc/â€ followed by pressing the TAB key will display that directories full contents.
* An attacker gains complete knowledge of the underlying filesystem structure including all available binaries within the userâ€™s PATH environment variable.

**Brocade's statement**

**Brocade Fabric OS: v7.4.1b and v7.3.1d have reached End of Availability (EOA) and are no longer supported. Brocade recommends Customers run supported Brocade software versions.**

* Brocade Fabric OS Administration Guide documents default users accounts for Brocade Fabric OS actively supported versions.
* The Brocade Fabric OS Administration Guide reads: â€œpredefined accounts offered by Fabric OS that are available in the local-switch user database. The password for all default accounts should be changed during the initial installation and configuration of each switch.â€
* In all actively supported Brocade Fabric OS versions, users cannot move beyond file systems permission assigned to them; the switch admin can also restrict user access to the switch.
* In Brocade Fabric OS 9. x, released June 24th, 2020, Brocade has made architectural changes to prevent using <tab> <tab>.
* Customers are advised to refer to the [Brocade Product End-of-Life report](https://www.broadcom.com/support/fibre-channel-networking/eol).
