- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to use the `more` binary and tab-completion within the restricted shell environment (rbash) of Brocade Fabric OS. This allows users, even those with restricted access (like the "user" or "factory" accounts), to bypass intended file system access restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a privileged directory traversal vulnerability that allows access to the entire filesystem. The usage of `more` binary in conjunction with tab-completion makes it possible to list the full contents of the filesystem, even for restricted accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain complete knowledge of the underlying filesystem structure including all available binaries within the user's PATH environment variable. This could lead to further exploitation or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an active SSH session with the affected software. By typing `more` and using tab-completion, the attacker can explore the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a restricted shell (rbash) session on the affected Brocade Fabric OS, either with the “user” or “factory” account.
