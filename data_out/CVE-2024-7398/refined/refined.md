Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the calendar event name within the Concrete CMS application. Specifically, the event name was not properly escaped before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the application's database and executed when a user views the calendar event.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in the browser of users viewing the event.
- Account compromise: The injected JavaScript could be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Calendar Event Addition: An attacker can inject the malicious payload when creating a new calendar event.
- Calendar Event Modification: An attacker could also inject the malicious payload by modifying an existing event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- High Privileges: The attacker needs to have the permission to create and modify event calendars in Concrete CMS.
- User Interaction: The attacker does not need to interact with the victim directly, however, the victim must navigate to the page or view the event where the malicious code is present to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne (report ID 2400810).
- The vulnerability is fixed in Concrete CMS version 8 with commit 7c8ed0d1d9db0d7f6df7fa066e0858ea618451a5 and in version 9 through commits 12183 and 12184.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v4 score of 1.8 with vector `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N`
- The fix involves sanitizing the calendar event name on output, preventing the injection and execution of arbitrary scripts.
- The vulnerable code was located in `/concrete/views/dialogs/event/view_version.php` in version 8.
