## Security Updates

* Fixed [CVE-2024-8291](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-8291) Stored XSS in Image Editor Background Color by sanitizing output of "Save Background Image Colour" in file thumbnail dashboard single page with [commit dbce253166f6b10ff3e0c09e50fd395370b8b065](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/dbce253166f6b10ff3e0c09e50fd395370b8b065) for version 8 and [commit 12183](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12183)
  for version 9. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS v4 score of 2.1 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N) Prior to the fix a rogue admin could add malicious code to the Thumbnails/Add Type. Thanks Alexey Solovyev for reporting HackerOne 921527.
* Fixed [CVE-2024-7398](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-7398) Stored XSS Vulnerability in Calendar Event Addition Feature with [commit 7c8ed0d1d9db0d7f6df7fa066e0858ea618451a5](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/7c8ed0d1d9db0d7f6df7fa066e0858ea618451a5) for version 8 and commits [12183](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12183) and [12184](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12184) for version 9. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 1.8 with vector [VSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N) Prior to the fix, the calendar event name was not sanitized on output. Users or groups with permission to create event calendars could embed scripts and users or groups with permission to modify event calendars could execute scripts. Thank you Yusuke Uchida for reporting HackerOne 2400810.
* Fixed [CVE-2024-8661](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-8661) Stored XSS in the "Next&Previous Nav" block with commit [12204](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/pull/12204) for version 9 and with commit [ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4](https://github.com/concretecms/concretecms/commit/ce5ee2ab83fe8de6fa012dd51c5a1dde05cb0dc4) for version 8. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector [CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N). Prior to the fix, a rogue admin could add a malicious payload. Since the "Next&Previous Nav" block output was not sufficiently sanitized, the malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users.
