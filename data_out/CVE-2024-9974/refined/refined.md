Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `product_id` parameter of the "Add to Cart" feature. This parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user-supplied input (`product_id`) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive information can be extracted from the database.
- **Disruption of Normal Operations:** Attackers can potentially disrupt normal operations by manipulating database records or even deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `/classes/Master.php?f=add_to_card` endpoint.
- **`product_id` Parameter:**  The attacker manipulates the `product_id` parameter in the POST request to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads that will execute SQL queries within the database.

**Additional Details:**
- The application is **Online Eyewear Shop Website version 1.0.**
- The vulnerability is in the `classes/Master.php?f=add_to_card` endpoint.
- The vulnerability is considered **critical** and is currently **unpatched**.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, including a sample HTTP POST request with a SQL injection payload.
- The PoC utilizes a `SLEEP(5)` command to illustrate a successful injection.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like SQLMap.
