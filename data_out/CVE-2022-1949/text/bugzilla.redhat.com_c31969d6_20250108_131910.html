| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2091781#c0)  Sandipan Roy    2022-05-31 04:00:00 UTC  ``` mishandling of the filter that would yield incorrect results, but as that has progressed, we have determined that it actually is an access control bypass. This may allow any remote un-authenticated user to issue a filter that allows searching for database items they do not have access to, including but not limited to potentially userPassword hashes and other sensitive data.   <https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/5170>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2091781#c1)  Sandipan Roy    2022-05-31 04:20:31 UTC  ``` Created 389-ds-base tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-34 [[bug 2091786](show_bug.cgi?id=2091786 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-1949 389-ds-base: access control bypass by query (filter in LDAP terms) optimiser [fedora-34]")] Affects: fedora-35 [[bug 2091787](show_bug.cgi?id=2091787 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2022-1949 389-ds-base: access control bypass by query (filter in LDAP terms) optimiser [fedora-35]")] Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2091788](show_bug.cgi?id=2091788 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-1949 389-ds-base: access control bypass by query (filter in LDAP terms) optimiser [fedora-36]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2091781#c2)  William Brown    2022-05-31 04:33:25 UTC  ``` Hi there, thanks for creating this!   It's worth pointing out that since this was found, we have a working (public) reproducer, and that it may be possible to use this to extract userPassword hashes, private keys, kerberos master keys (freeipa). I think the access complexity may also have dropped as a result of this.  Additionally, this affects all versions of 389-ds from 1.3.x onwards.   Hope that helps,  There are patches upstream: see: <https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/5170#issuecomment-1140630971>   ``` |  |
