| LDAP queries are evaluated by our backend in the order of provided terms, which can cause surprising performance issues. These have tried to be mitigated with tools like the idl scan limit, but a proper query optimiser will help us with non optimal searches. |

`[Issue 5170 - RFE - Filter optimiser](/Firstyear/389-ds-base/commit/ce6157dd5e10f31fdb8b024ab22c2336f5738a9c "Issue 5170 - RFE - Filter optimiser

Bug Description: This introduces a query optimiser to 389-ds.
A query optimiser helps our backend process queries in a manner
that is more efficient by reducing IO events, and returning
the correct results quicker. This is needed as most applications
are not aware of the internals of how we execute a query internally
 - nor should they need to know. As an example, queries commonly
produced by SSSD are suboptimial and cause high latency and IO, but
this optimiser can resolve the majority of these issues which
generally improves all server throughput.

Fix Description: The optimiser works by attempting to produce
\"the smallest candidate set\" first. Having a smaller candidate
set earlier means that we can be below the filter test threshold
which shortcuts and can evaluate the remaining filter assertions
on the partial candidate set, rather than loading more expensive
and larger indexes. This also allows us to \"fail fast\" by
promoting \"unlikely\" candidates earlier which may end up
having a zero-length so that again, we don't load larger indexes.

A number of other changes were made and resolved in this change:

* Issue: The onelevel filter (not related to the
    optimiser ...) works be injecting a parentid field check
    to the filter that is used in the search. If the user
    does not have access to read this field, then one level
    searches fail

* Fix: Split the filter by \"intent\" and \"as
    executed\". We can filter test on as executed without check
    of the ACI, but we also check the filter as executed to
    ensure that only valid entries matching the proper semantics
    are returned

* Fix: Duplicate the filter for optimisation instead
    and free it in the search path, leaving the pblock filter as
    the \"query as intended\".

* Issue: In some cases, the filter test shortcut was
    applied, but with a specially crafted query, this could trigger
    the return prematurely giving incorrect results as the filter
    test was NOT bubbled up correctly.

* Fix: Flag in the sr that the filter test MUST be
    applied in certain shortcut cases.

the correct results quicker. This is needed as most applications
are not aware of the internals of how we execute a query internally
 - nor should they need to know. As an example, queries commonly
produced by SSSD are suboptimial and cause high latency and IO, but
this optimiser can resolve the majority of these issues which
generally improves all server throughput.

Fix Description: The optimiser works by attempting to produce
\"the smallest candidate set\" first. Having a smaller candidate
set earlier means that we can be below the filter test threshold
which shortcuts and can evaluate the remaining filter assertions
on the partial candidate set, rather than loading more expensive
and larger indexes. This also allows us to \"fail fast\" by
promoting \"unlikely\" candidates earlier which may end up
having a zero-length so that again, we don't load larger indexes.

A number of other changes were made and resolved in this change:

* Issue: The onelevel filter (not related to the
    optimiser ...) works be injecting a parentid field check
    to the filter that is used in the search. If the user
    does not have access to read this field, then one level
    searches fail

* Fix: Split the filter by \"intent\" and \"as
    executed\". We can filter test on as executed without check
    of the ACI, but we also check the filter as executed to
    ensure that only valid entries matching the proper semantics
    are returned

* Fix: Duplicate the filter for optimisation instead
    and free it in the search path, leaving the pblock filter as
    the \"query as intended\".

* Issue: In some cases, the filter test shortcut was
    applied, but with a specially crafted query, this could trigger
    the return prematurely giving incorrect results as the filter
    test was NOT bubbled up correctly.

* Fix: Flag in the sr that the filter test MUST be
    applied in certain shortcut cases.

You reproduced it before, but not now. Could be as simple as a change in what is or isn't indexed, or a shortcut case, or something else. There is strong evidence that the aci check was NOT enforced else how did FreeIPA ever work? |

That's not entirely accurate, there was another ACI that was correctly allowing read access, but a different ACI was incorrectly rejecting the Search with your optimizer code. So there was never a CVE/aci bypass in the IPA case.  So IPA had this aci which was allowing access:  aci: (targetfilter="(&(objectclass=nsContainer)(!(objectclass=krbPwdPolicy)))" )(target!="ldap:///cn=masters,cn=ipa,cn=etc,dc=ipa,dc=test")(targetattr="obje ctclass || cn")(version 3.0; acl "Anonymous read access to containers"; allow (read, search, compare) userdn = "ldap:///anyone";)  But another ACI for the "admin group" was incorrectly overriding this ACI with the optimizer. |

I am just stumped why it's not working now. I'll put some more time into trying to reproduce it today |

Bug Description: In the filter test during access only
checks, OR conditions were not correctly evaluated. They
would have their access checked, but it was not confirmed
if this was the element that the entry matched. This mean
that queries could incorrectly reduce entries.

Fix Description: Remove the access check only mode from being
using in filter tests since it is broken, and requires the full
filter test to be evaluated along with it to work in complex cases.
