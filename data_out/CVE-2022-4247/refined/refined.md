Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-4247
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Movie Ticket Booking System (PHP)
*   **Vulnerable File:** `booking.php`
*   **Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `id` parameter passed via a GET request is directly used in the SQL query.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted GET request to `booking.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
    *   The application uses this unsanitized input in an SQL query.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Integrity:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Availability:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the application.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned, suggesting that this is an unauthenticated vulnerability.
*   **Technical Details:** The `id` parameter from the GET request is used directly in an SQL query, without sanitization. The provided proof-of-concept exploit uses a crafted SQL query in the `id` parameter:
    `http://vulcinema.test/booking.php?id=3%20or%20(select%201%20from%20(select%20count(*),concat(user(),floor(rand(0)*2))x%20from%20information_schema.tables%20group%20by%20x)a)`
This exploit attempts to extract the database user name by injecting a malicious SQL query through the vulnerable `id` parameter.
*   **Exploit Availability**: A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
*   **Mitigation**: The report recommends replacing the affected component. The report does not explicitly specify how to mitigate the vulnerability by patching the code, however, it would require implementing proper input sanitization and parameterized queries.
*   **Additional Information**: There are related vulnerabilities (VDB-198475, VDB-207643, VDB-214627, and VDB-239351). The vulnerability was disclosed on 12/01/2022.
*   **CVSS Score:** The VulDB Meta Temp score is 7.3, whereas the NVD base score is 9.8.
