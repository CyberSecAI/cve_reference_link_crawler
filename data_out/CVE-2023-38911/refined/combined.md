# CSZ CMS Stored XSS and HTML injection in plugin "Gallery"

## Author: (Desencrypt)

### CVE: [CVE-2023-38911](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38911)

#### **Software Link**: [CSZ CMS](https://www.cszcms.com/)

#### **Version**: 1.3.0

**Description:** CSZ CMS 1.3.0 is affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) feature that allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload entered in the 'Gallery' section and choosing our Gallery. previously created, in the 'YouTube URL' field, this input is affected by an XSS.
It should be noted that previously when creating a gallery the "Name" field was vulnerable to XSS, but this was resolved in the current version 1.3.0, the vulnerability found affects the "YouTube URL" field within the created gallery.

---

### POC:

When logging into the panel, we will go to the "Gallery" section and create a Carousel [http://localhost/admin/plugin/gallery], the vulnerable field is located at [http://localhost/admin/plugin/gallery/edit/2]

We edit that Gallery that we have created and see that we can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the “Youtube URL”fields.

We can inject HTML code

With the following payload we can achieve the XSS

```
<div><p title="</div><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>">
```

### ANNOTATIONS:

In the previous version 1.2.9 there was a script vulnerability (XSS) in different pages through the field name, it remains to be noted that this vulnerability was fixed in the new version (1.3.0) so the vulnerability found, which was discussed above is totally different.
Below is an image showing that the old vulnerability was fixed in the new version (1.3.0).

However, the current vulnerability found is different, the vulnerable fields are within the created Carousel (they are different fields), these vulnerable fields are "Youtube URL".
