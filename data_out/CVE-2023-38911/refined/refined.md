- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "YouTube URL" field within the Gallery plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, leading to potential malicious actions on the victim's browser when the gallery is viewed. This could result in session hijacking, defacement, or further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by injecting a malicious payload into the "YouTube URL" field when creating or editing a gallery within the CSZ CMS admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the CSZ CMS to access the "Gallery" section and manipulate the "YouTube URL" field.
