# Project Takeover via IDOR in ProjectPermissionController

High

[fguillot](/fguillot)
published
GHSA-x8v7-3ghx-65cv
Jun 6, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.2.36

## Patched versions

>= 1.2.37

## Description

### Details

The vulnerability is in the file `app/Controller/ProjectPermissionController.php`, more specically in the function `addUser()`.

* The users permission to add users to a project only get checked on the URL parameter `project_id`. If the user is authorized to add users to this project the request gets processed.
* The users permission for the body parameter `project_id` is not verified while processing the request.

### PoC

1. login as admin and create two projects. For example 'secret' (id=1) and 'public' (id=2).
2. create a new user 'unprivileged'
3. add the user 'unprivileged' to the public project as a 'Project Manager'
4. Start burp and login as the unprivileged user account
5. Go to the edit permissions screen on the public project (`/project/2/premissions`)
6. Enable intercept in burp
7. Add the unprivileged user as a project manager again
8. In the intercepted request change the `project_id` in the post request body from 2 to 1

```
  POST /?controller=ProjectPermissionController&action=addUser&project_id=2 HTTP/1.1
  [...]
  csrf_token=f607a23025aff9ab327e4e4cb0bac35b204705a2329fae4877bdc0c7ef839164&project_id=1&user_id=2&username=unprivileged&external_id=&external_id_column=&name=test&role=project-manager

```

9. Go to the projects overview and see the private project, the unprivileged account is now a project manager for that project

### Impact

This is an IDOR vulnerability with high impact.

An attacker with the "Project Manager" role on a single project may take over any other project.

Using this method the attacker could:

* access information present in project the attacker should not have access to
* change users access to project (e.g. kick them)
* delete any ticket
* edit any ticket
* delete any project

### Additional notes

`addUser()` does not verify the `csrf_token` parameter sent in the body.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
