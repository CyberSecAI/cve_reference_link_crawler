### @pankajkoti **[pankajkoti](/pankajkoti)** commented [Jun 21, 2023](#issue-1767765797) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

With this PR, the test connection functionality will be disabled

by default across Airflow UI, API and CLI. The availability of the

functionality can be controlled by the `test_connection` flag in

the `core` section of the Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`).

It can also be controlled by the environment variable

`AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION`.

The following values are accepted for this config param:

1. `Disabled`: Disables the test connection functionality and

   disables(greys out) the Test Connection button in the UI.

   This is also the default value set in the Airflow configuration.
2. `Enabled`: Enables the test connection functionality and

   activates the Test Connection button in the UI.
3. `Hidden`: Disables the test connection functionality and

   hides the Test Connection button in UI.

We also need to disable endpoints that serve this functionality! It can't be a UI only thing.

| We also need a significant newsfragment for that one [@pankajkoti](https://github.com/pankajkoti)  Thank you. Naive to add this one. Added one by following the guideline [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#step-4-prepare-pr) which says it can be like a git commit message for significant types and also taking reference of [this PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31277/files#diff-527c5b0190068f64dc65bdf2b25137ca746178bf33f811aeb5bd4928dfe1d97e) |

| One more small comment. I've been thiknig about it.. Currently we have this but only in comments.  ``` Before setting this to Enabled, make sure that you review the users who are able to add/edit         connections and ensure they are trusted. Connection testing can be done maliciously leading to         undesired and insecure outcomes.  ```  Should we make also add some more information (link to the right part of the security model documentation once we merge [#32098](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32098) should be enough ) - both in the newsfragment (effectively release notes) and in the place in documentation where we explain test connection, to explain why it is - potentially - dangerous to enable test connection?  I think we should be very explicit about it if we want to make our model influence decisions of our users. |

| yes makes sense. Which part of the PR would we like to link it to? Some section in this file `docs/apache-airflow/security/index.rst` ?  Will wait for the PR to be merged and then link it here. I am also thinking to reword `Deployment admin` -> `Deployment Manager` as was suggested earlier and in the security model. Will do that to when I link the section in my next commit. |
