- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Newsletter Popup plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting a subscriber.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability, allowing attackers to induce unintended actions by a logged-in administrator. Specifically, deleting a subscriber through a crafted request.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete subscribers from the newsletter list without their consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link, which when clicked by a logged in admin, sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint, leading to subscriber deletion. The URL includes the `rid` parameter with a valid user ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or loading an image that sends the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
