- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly handle cacheable HTTP responses in the web service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of cacheable HTTP responses leading to data being stored in a local cache without proper protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially read and modify data stored in the local cache.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the web service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web service. No authentication is explicitly required. The attack requires that the application improperly cache responses from the web service, which the attacker can then potentially exploit.
