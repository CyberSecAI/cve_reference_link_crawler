# Denial of Service when ++api++ is used many times

High

[mauritsvanrees](/mauritsvanrees)
published
GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq
Sep 21, 2023

## Package

pip

plone.rest
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2.0.0, 3.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.1, 3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

When the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive.

### Patches

Patches will be released in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Series 1.x is not affected.

### Workarounds

In your frontend web server (nginx, Apache) you can redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++`.

## Credits

This was reported to the [Plone Security Team](https://plone.org/security/report) by Fred van Dijk. Thanks!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-42457

Message-ID: <1afd8036-850f-c98e-5ee8-9e95f658e82e@vanrees.org>
Date: Fri, 22 Sep 2023 12:14:42 +0200
From: Maurits van Rees <maurits@...rees.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Plone security advisory 2023/09/21

Various vulnerabilities in Plone and Zope have been reported and fixed.
They affect all supported Plone versions: 5.2 and 6.0. Older Plone
versions are likely also affected.
There will be no traditional hotfix package for these: you should update
the version pins of individual packages. See [this
post](<https://community.plone.org/t/less-plone-hotfix-packages/17931?u=mauritsvanrees>)
about why we do less hotfix packages.

The information can be found here:
<https://community.plone.org/t/plone-security-advisory-2023-09-21/17941>
<https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20230921>

The text is included below.

## Denial of service

In `plone.rest` when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used
multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making
the server less responsive.

Security advisory:
[CVE-2023-42457](<https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq>).

## Stored XSS

There is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. A
[security hotfix from
2021](<https://github.com/plone/Products.PloneHotfix20210518>) already
partially fixed this, by making sure SVG images are always downloaded
instead of shown inline. But the same problem still exists for *scales*
of SVG images. And it exists for *user portraits*, both in Volto and
ClassicUI.

Technically, ClassicUI is not vulnerable for the user portrait part,
because you cannot upload an SVG as user portrait. But in Volto you can,
so you may be able to access a vulnerable url in the backend anyway.

Note that a page that uses an image tag with an SVG image as source is
never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To
exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload a
malicious SVG image, and then trick a user into following a specially
crafted link.

Fixes are needed in three packages. We link to the security advisories:

*
[`plone.namedfile`](<https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/security/advisories/GHSA-jj7c-jrv4-c65x>)
CVE-2023-41048
*
[`Zope`](<https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v>)
CVE-2023-42458
*
[`plone.restapi`](<https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi/security/advisories/GHSA-hc5c-r8m5-2gfh>)
also CVE-2023-42458

## Information disclosure and sandbox escape

Earlier this month, new Zope releases were made, which included security
releases of `AccessControl` and `RestrictedPython` . See the [community
announcement](<https://community.plone.org/t/zope-4-8-9-and-5-8-4-released-with-a-security-fix/17849>).

## Fixed Plone versions

All needed packages are included in Plone 5.2.14 and 6.0.7 which have
just been released.

## Package versions

If you cannot or do not want to upgrade your entire Plone version, you
can upgrade individual package versions.

Fixes are available in these versions:

```
AccessControl = 4.4, 5.8, 6.2
RestrictedPython = 5.4, 6.2
plone.namedfile = 5.6.1, 6.0.3, 6.1.3, 6.2.1
plone.rest = 2.0.1, 3.0.1
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
Zope = 4.8.10, 5.8.5
```

If you are using Buildout, then for the `Zope`, `AccessControl` and
`RestrictedPython` versions it is best to update the `[buildout]
extends` lines to include the following.

For Plone 5.2:
<https://zopefoundation.github.io/Zope/releases/4.8.10/versions.cfg>

For Plone 6:
<https://zopefoundation.github.io/Zope/releases/5.8.5/versions.cfg>

So which versions of these packages should you use on which Plone version?

To avoid surprises, you should use the version that is closest to the
version you are already using. If you use the default versions, the
following should help. This uses the Buildout notation. If you use a pip
constraints file, you should use a double equals sign.

### Plone 5.2

```
AccessControl = 4.4
plone.namedfile = 5.6.1
RestrictedPython = 5.4
Zope = 4.8.10
```

If you run Plone 5.2 on Python 3, and you are already using
`plone.restapi` 8, then you can additionally use:

```
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
```

### Plone 6.0.0/6.0.1

```
AccessControl = 5.8
plone.namedfile = 6.0.3
plone.rest = 2.0.1
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
RestrictedPython = 6.2
Zope = 5.8.5
```

### Plone 6.0.2

```
AccessControl = 5.8
plone.namedfile = 6.0.3
plone.rest = 3.0.1
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
RestrictedPython = 6.2
Zope = 5.8.5
```

### Plone 6.0.3/6.0.4

```
AccessControl = 6.2
plone.namedfile = 6.0.3
plone.rest = 3.0.1
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
RestrictedPython = 6.2
Zope = 5.8.5
```

### Plone 6.0.5/6.0.6

```
AccessControl = 6.2
plone.namedfile = 6.1.3
plone.rest = 3.0.1
plone.restapi = 8.43.4
RestrictedPython = 6.2
Zope = 5.8.5
```

If you are having problems with the installation, or see regressions,
please make a post in this thread, and anyone can help you.

If you see further security problems, please [mail the Plone/Zope
Security Team](mailto:security@...ne.org).
