I have added an option `-o ExitOnTrivialAuth=yes` to disable trivial authentications as discussed in our mails

Sorry, something went wrong.

It shouldn't clear is\_trivial\_auth here since it doesn't require any user interaction? For pubkey auth I guess it should clear is\_trivial\_auth for an agent pubkey signature (not trial request), otherwise leave it set.
