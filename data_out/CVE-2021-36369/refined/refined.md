Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-36369:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a non-RFC-compliant check of available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code of Dropbear. This allows a malicious SSH server to manipulate the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The client-side SSH implementation does not properly handle the negotiation of authentication methods with the server.
- Specifically, the client does not enforce the expected authentication sequence, making it possible for a malicious server to bypass additional security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Security Measures:** Attackers can bypass additional security measures, like FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass, which are designed to enhance login security.
- **Abuse Forwarded Agents:** An attacker can leverage a forwarded agent (an authentication mechanism) to log on to another server without the user's knowledge or explicit consent.
- **Unnoticed Access:** The attack allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to other systems via a compromised client, without raising suspicion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker is positioned as a MitM between the client and the server, or if the client connects to a malicious server.
- **Malicious Server:** A malicious server can exploit the vulnerability upon connection to a vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the SSH server or be in a position to intercept the connection between the client and a legitimate server.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is present in Dropbear versions up to 2020.81.
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in Dropbear version 2022.82, which includes the `-o DisableTrivialAuth` client option.
- The vulnerability is client-side only, meaning it only impacts the Dropbear client and not the server.
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with high integrity impact but no impact to confidentiality or availability.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)
