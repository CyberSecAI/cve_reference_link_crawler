The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6485.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of content sanitization when using *data-\*-text* attributes (e.g., *data-complete-text*) associated with a button's state feature in Bootstrap 3. Specifically, HTML within these attributes is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Inadequate sanitization of user-controlled input in button attributes.
- The use of `data-*` attributes, intended to pass values to the `button()` method, does not sanitize user-provided data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Injection of malicious scripts into a user's browser.
- Potential exfiltration of sensitive data to remote servers.
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's context.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious code through *data-\*-text* attributes.
- The injected code is executed when the button's state is changed via Javascript.
- This can occur when data attributes are bound to URL parameters or input fields controlled by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control or influence the values of the *data-\*-text* attributes. This typically requires some means of injecting or modifying HTML, such as by controlling a URL parameter or form field.
- User interaction (clicking the button) is typically required to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Bootstrap versions >=1.4.0 and <=3.4.1.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating the vulnerability by injecting a script into the `data-loading-text` attribute, which triggers when a button is clicked.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in the Never-Ending Support (NES) version of Bootstrap 3 offered by HeroDevs (version 3.4.5).
- Mitigation strategies include migrating to a newer version of Bootstrap or utilizing a commercial support partner like HeroDevs that offers a patched version.
