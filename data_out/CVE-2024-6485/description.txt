A security vulnerability has been discovered in bootstrap that could enable Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is associated with the data-loading-text attribute within the button plugin. This vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the attribute, which would then be executed when the button's loading state is triggered.
