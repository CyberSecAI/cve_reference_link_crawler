- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software does not correctly perform authorization checks, allowing attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. Specifically, Forcepoint One Endpoint prior to version 22.01 does not provide sufficient anti-tampering protection of services by users with Administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization and insufficient anti-tampering protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass access restrictions and, specifically for Forcepoint One Endpoint, a user with administrator privileges could disable the software and its protection.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the software's flawed authorization mechanisms. For Forcepoint One Endpoint, a user with administrator privileges on the Windows machine is needed to disable the software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** For the general authorization flaw, the attacker needs to trigger an action that should be subject to authorization, but which is not properly checked. For the Forcepoint One Endpoint vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator privileges on the Windows machine where Forcepoint One Endpoint is installed.
