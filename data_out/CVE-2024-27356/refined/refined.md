Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The web interface creates a symbolic link `/www/js/logread.tar` pointing to the log archive `/tmp/logread.tar`.
*   This link remains active even after a user logs out of the web interface.
*   Similar behavior exists for OpenVPN server configurations

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Exposure:** The log and OpenVPN configuration files, even after logout, can be accessed through the persistent symbolic link via a direct URL.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the exported log and config files are not protected by proper authentication/authorization measures after a user logs out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download sensitive information such as logs and VPN configurations
*   **Potential Credential Exposure:** Logs might contain sensitive user information, potentially including credentials or API keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local area network (LAN) as the vulnerable device.
*   **Direct URL Access:** The attacker can download the log file using `curl` or similar tools by accessing the publicly available link at `/js/logread.tar` via the device's IP address, even if the user is logged out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same local area network as the affected GL.iNet router.
*   The attacker needs to know the router's IP address on the LAN.
*   No user interaction is required beyond accessing the affected URL to download the log file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of GL.iNet router models.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in specific firmware versions for each affected device.
*   The specific exploit command is provided in the content.
