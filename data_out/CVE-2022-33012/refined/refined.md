Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-33012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `Host` header during the password reset process in Microweber CMS. The application uses the provided `Host` header to generate the password reset link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the `Host` header, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious domain.
*   **Password Reset Poisoning:** By injecting a malicious host, the password reset link sent to the user contains a link pointing to the attacker's domain, not the legitimate site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can obtain a valid password reset token for any user by sending a password reset request with a malicious host header, then use that token to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `Host` header in the password reset request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker doesn't need access to any credentials other than the victim's email address, as the attack targets the password reset function.

**More Detail Than CVE:**

*   The provided blog post provides a detailed timeline of vulnerability discovery, CVE assignment, and vendor communication.
*   It includes a link to a proof-of-concept exploit (`PayloadsAllTheThings`) and a reference to a similar vulnerability.
*   It explicitly mentions that the vulnerable code/function is intentionally not disclosed due to lack of vendor response.
*   It highlights the impact of the vulnerability being a complete account takeover.
*   The `pethuraj.com` content provides a breakdown of how Host Header Injection works in the context of password resets, including Burp Suite interception steps and the ability to obtain valid password reset tokens.

In summary, CVE-2022-33012 is caused by a Host Header Injection vulnerability in Microweber, which allows an attacker to poison password reset links, leading to account takeover. The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `Host` header in the password reset request.
