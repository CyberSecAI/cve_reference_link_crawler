### **[Hebing123](/Hebing123)** commented [May 21, 2024](#issue-2307962516)

| Summary A reflected XSS vulnerability was discovered in lylme\_spage v1.9.5 on the `admin/link.php`. Details    [lylme\_spage/admin/link.php](https://github.com/LyLme/lylme_spage/blob/b7c430a49e8b247ddb04401b1176157c10d52948/admin/link.php#L71-L77)  Lines 71 to 77 in [b7c430a](/LyLme/lylme_spage/commit/b7c430a49e8b247ddb04401b1176157c10d52948)   |  | $id = $\_GET['id']; | | --- | --- | |  | $row2 = $DB->query("select \* from lylme\_links where id='$id' limit 1"); | |  | $row = $DB->fetch($row2); | |  | preg\_match\_all('/<font color=[\"|\']+(.\*?)[\"|\']>/i', $row['name'], $color); | |  | echo '<h4>修改链接信息</h4> | |  | <div class="panel-body"> | |  | <form action="./link.php?set=edit\_submit&id=' . $id . '" method="POST"> |     The vulnerability stems from the lack of filtering or encoding of the $id parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into a link.php page.
