- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of filtering or encoding of the `$id` parameter in `admin/link.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `$id` parameter from the URL).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other client-side attacks. The provided PoC demonstrates that it is possible to execute JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable page.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the `link.php` page. The `id` parameter is obtained via the `$_GET` variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it. This could be done via phishing or social engineering.
