- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper privilege management in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of Cisco ISE.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation through crafted requests to the ERS API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of the affected device, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted requests to the vulnerable ERS API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected Cisco ISE device and have the ERS API enabled. The attack can be performed remotely.
