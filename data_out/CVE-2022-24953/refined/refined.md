The provided content relates to CVE-2022-24953.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper construction of command-line arguments passed to the `gpg` (GNU Privacy Guard) executable. Specifically, the lack of an end-of-options marker (`--`) before operation arguments in the `Crypt_GPG` library allowed for potential injection of additional options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the potential for command injection. Without the end-of-options marker, arguments intended for `gpg` operations could be misinterpreted as options, leading to unexpected behavior or malicious command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: An attacker could potentially inject malicious options into the `gpg` command line. This could lead to various impacts, including:
   - Modification or deletion of keys
   - Export of sensitive data
   - Execution of arbitrary commands depending on `gpg` version and context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `keyId` or other arguments passed to the `Crypt_GPG` library's functions, such that they introduce malicious options when constructing the command-line string for `gpg`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need control over the input data (e.g., `keyId`) used by the application which utilizes `Crypt_GPG` to generate command line arguments for gpg.
- The attacker does not require local access, but does need to be able to influence the input of the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The commit `74c8f989cefbe0887274b461dc56197e121bfd04` introduces the fix by adding `--` before key arguments in several methods in `Crypt/GPG.php` and `Crypt/GPGAbstract.php`:
*   `Crypt/GPG.php`:
    *   `deletePublicKey()`:  `$operation = '--delete-key ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);` changed to `$operation = '--delete-key -- ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);`
    *   `deletePrivateKey()`: `$operation = '--delete-secret-key ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);` changed to `$operation = '--delete-secret-key -- ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);`
    *   `getFingerprint()`:  `$operation = '--list-keys ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);` changed to  `$operation = '--list-keys -- ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);`
    *   `_exportKey()`: `$operation .= ' ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);` changed to `$operation .= ' -- ' . escapeshellarg($fingerprint);`
*   `Crypt/GPGAbstract.php`:
    *   `_getKeys()` for secret keys: `$operation = '--utf8-strings --list-secret-keys ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);` changed to `$operation = '--utf8-strings --list-secret-keys -- ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);`
    *  `_getKeys()` for public keys:  `$operation = '--utf8-strings --list-public-keys ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);` changed to `$operation = '--utf8-strings --list-public-keys -- ' . escapeshellarg($keyId);`

The commit `29c0fbe96d0d4063ecd5c9a4644cb65a7fb7cc4e` updates the release notes to include `[CVE-2022-24953] Insert the end-of-options marker before operation arguments [thomas-chauchefoin-sonarsource].`
