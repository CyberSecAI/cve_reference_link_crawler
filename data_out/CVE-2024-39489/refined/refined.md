Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `seg6_hmac_init_algo` function in the Linux kernel's IPv6 stack had a memory leak. If the function failed during the allocation of either crypto transform (`tfm`) or shash descriptor (`shash`) structures, it would return an error without freeing already allocated resources leading to memory leaks. Specifically, if `crypto_alloc_shash` or `kzalloc_node` failed the function would exit prematurely without calling the appropriate cleanup functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is the failure to deallocate memory upon error conditions within the `seg6_hmac_init_algo` function. This leads to memory leaks every time the function fails in allocation.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated failures can lead to resource exhaustion if the memory isn't reclaimed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service condition due to excessive memory consumption.
*   **System Instability:** Continued memory leaks could lead to overall system instability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by causing failures within the `seg6_hmac_init_algo` function which could be achieved by stressing the system or by other actions that would cause a memory allocation to fail within the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to trigger the execution of `seg6_hmac_init_algo` and also the ability to manipulate the environment in such a way that the memory allocations fail, which would be possible with local access to the system.

The provided patches fix the vulnerability by:

1.  Adding a `goto error_out;` statement after failed memory allocations to jump to the cleanup routine.
2.  Updating `seg6_hmac_exit` to conditionally free memory only if it was actually allocated. This makes it safe to call `seg6_hmac_exit()` from the error handling path within `seg6_hmac_init_algo`.
