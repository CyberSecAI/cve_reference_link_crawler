Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the "stock history" field of the Online Eyewear Shop Website, which allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to neutralize or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the stock history field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored within the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies of users, including administrators, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Further compromise of the system
- **Compromise of Users and Administrators:**  Both regular users and administrators are at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the stock history field within the product inventory details page.
- An attacker would need to inject a malicious script (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`) into the vulnerable field via the application's interface. This script will be stored by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have a user account to access and modify the stock history entries.
- **Basic Web Interaction Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the vulnerable URL (`/admin/?page=inventory/view_inventory&id=2`) and interact with the stock history input field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the Online Eyewear Shop Website.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "HIGH" severity and "Unpatched".
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to insert a simple alert script.
