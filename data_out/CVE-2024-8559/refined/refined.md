Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE Correlation:**

The provided content from vuldb.com directly relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in "SourceCodester Online Food Menu 1.0", which is different from the stated CVE-2024-8559. Therefore, I'm analyzing the vulnerability described in the vuldb content, not CVE-2024-8559.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `delete-menu.php` script of the "SourceCodester Online Food Menu 1.0" application. Specifically, the `menu` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where malicious SQL code can be inserted into the `menu` parameter and executed on the database server. This allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, or even execute arbitrary commands on the server depending on database permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal data, or financial information.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify existing data, which can lead to data corruption or manipulation of the application's functionality.
- **Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete data, causing disruption to the application's services.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, if database permissions are not properly configured, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code on the database server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could use the vulnerability to make the database server unresponsive causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious GET request to `/food-menu/endpoint/delete-menu.php` with a crafted `menu` parameter.
- The attack vector involves the injection of SQL payloads via the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
- **Proxy tool:** An attacker would use a tool like burpsuite to intercept and modify the request.

**Specific Exploitation Details:**
The provided content includes the following successful attack payloads:
- `menu=4';SELECT+SLEEP(7)%23`
- `menu=4' AND EXTRACTVALUE(8269,CASE WHEN (8269=8269) THEN 8269 ELSE 0x3A END)-- jhtJ`
- `menu=4' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x71627a6a71,(SELECT (ELT(1777=1777,1))),0x716b6a7071),1777)-- uuXb`
- `menu=4';SELECT SLEEP(5)#`
- `menu=4' AND (SELECT 7516 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ythw)-- AVNZ`

These payloads demonstrate different SQL injection techniques, including time-based blind injection, error-based injection and stacked queries.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection found in the `/food-menu/endpoint/delete-menu.php` script. The lack of input sanitization on the 'menu' parameter allows for an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code, with significant potential impact.

**Additional Note:**
The provided sourcecodester.com content is not relevant to the vulnerability. It's a collection of articles and tutorials and doesn't contain any information about this vulnerability.

**Response:**
The vuldb content provides good detail on the SQL injection vulnerability.
