Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5709

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, specifically a Path Traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The plugin allows the inclusion of arbitrary local files.
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability allows the manipulation of file paths, enabling access to unauthorized files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By including and executing arbitrary files, attackers can run any PHP code present within these files.
- Access Control Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the system.
- Sensitive Data Disclosure: Attackers can obtain sensitive data by including and reading system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the `layout_name` parameter in the WPBakery Visual Composer plugin.
- An attacker can send a crafted request to the server with a malicious `layout_name` parameter, causing the inclusion of arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with Author-level access or higher.
- The attacker also needs to have the ability to create/edit posts and pages on the WordPress site.

**Affected Software:** WPBakery Visual Composer plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 7.7.

**Patched Version:** Version 7.8

**Additional Notes:** The vulnerability can be used to execute code from any included file, even files that are considered "safe", like images, provided they contain PHP code. This could happen if a user uploads a malicious image that contains php code.
