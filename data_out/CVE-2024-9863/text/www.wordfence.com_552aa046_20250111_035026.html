### Description

The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0 due to the insecure 'administrator' default value for the 'default\_user\_role' option. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an administrator user even if the registration form is disabled.
