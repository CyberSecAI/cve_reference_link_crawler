The provided content describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in the NCP Secure Enterprise Client, identified as **usd-2022-0006**, not CVE-2023-28872. Therefore, the content is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE.

However, I will provide information on the vulnerability found in the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the NCP Secure Enterprise Client's Support Assistant feature, which gathers diagnostic information and stores it in a user-controlled temporary directory (`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp\NcpSupport\`). This directory allows low-privileged users to create symbolic links, which the application does not handle securely during the Support Assistant process. Specifically, the application changes permissions on files within this directory, making it possible to redirect these operations to arbitrary files outside of this directory using symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure handling of symbolic links within a user-controlled temporary directory.
- The Support Assistant changes permissions on the target of a symbolic link created by the user.
- Insufficient checks before modifying file permissions by the client's service.
- High-privileged services load DLLs based on paths specified in a configuration file that can be modified by low-privilege users using the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A low-privileged attacker can achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by manipulating file permissions and configuration files. This allows for arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be a low-privileged user on the system running the vulnerable NCP Secure Enterprise Client.
- The attacker uses the Support Assistant feature.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by creating a symbolic link within the temporary directory.
- The attacker modifies the configuration file via the created symbolic link to point to a malicious DLL.
- The attacker reboots the system which triggers the loading of the malicious DLL by the high-privilege service or the malicious DLL is loaded automatically at a certain point of time by the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a low-privileged user account on the system running the vulnerable NCP Secure Enterprise Client.
- The attacker must have the ability to create symbolic links.
- The attacker needs access to the client GUI to start the Support Assistant, but it's not mentioned if it can be done via CLI/API calls or not.
