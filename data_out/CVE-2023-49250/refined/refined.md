{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `HttpUtils` class in Apache DolphinScheduler did not verify certificates when making HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure TLS TrustManager"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can impersonate the server due to the lack of certificate verification, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on outgoing HTTPS connections."
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the DolphinScheduler client and server."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in Apache DolphinScheduler versions up to 3.2.0. The fix involves ensuring the HttpUtils class only gets the result from certification URL and verifies certificates for https connection. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.2.1."
