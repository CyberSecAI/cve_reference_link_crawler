Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35507:

**CVE-2022-35507**: This CVE ID is assigned to the CRLF injection vulnerability described in the blog post.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The PVE server uses a regex to sanitize error messages, aiming to prevent additional lines from breaking HTTP responses, but this regex only prevents LF (%0a). It is possible to inject response headers using CR (%0d).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **CRLF Injection**: The server fails to properly sanitize error messages, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return characters (%0d) into the HTTP response headers.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization**:  The server's method to prevent header injection is flawed as it only considers LF character, missing CR character.
    *   **Lack of Header Length Limits**: The server does impose a limit on HTTP request header length, but does not sanitize or validate header content, enabling a DoS vector.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS)**: By injecting headers using CR, an attacker can set long cookies multiple times on the victim's PVE domain.  Subsequent requests with the oversized cookie header will be rejected by the server, causing a DoS condition until the victim clears cookies.
    *   **Header Manipulation:**  While not fully explored in the blog post, the vulnerability could potentially be used to inject arbitrary headers, although this is not explicitly demonstrated or thoroughly analyzed in this context.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Network**: The attacker crafts a malicious webpage that the victim is tricked into visiting. The webpage sets long cookies on the victimâ€™s PVE domain.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Client-side interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user with an active session on the PVE web UI to visit a malicious page.
    *   **Browser-specific requirements:** The attack leverages the way Chromium-based browsers handle CR characters in headers.
    *   **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability is triggered on the victim's browser by setting cookies. The PVE server itself does not require authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code locations and the details of the exploitation method.
* The content also notes that Firefox is not vulnerable to this particular attack vector because it does not interpret CR characters as line breaks without a LF.
* The blog post mentions that the vulnerability is patched in `pve-http-server` version `4.1-3` by adding an additional check for `\r\n`.
