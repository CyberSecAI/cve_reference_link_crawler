- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `cuobjdump` command of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. It is triggered when a malformed ELF file is provided as input, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves providing a malformed ELF file to the vulnerable `cuobjdump` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to execute the `cuobjdump` command. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
