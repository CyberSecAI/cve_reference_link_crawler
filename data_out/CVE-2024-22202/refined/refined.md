Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22202:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper server-side validation on the user removal request in phpMyFAQ. While the front-end prevents modification of user details in the removal request form, the server does not verify the submitted user ID, login name, and email against the currently logged-in user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The server-side code does not adequately validate the user details submitted in the removal request form, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `userId`, `loginname`, and `email` fields.
- **Lack of Authorization Check:** There is no check to ensure the user requesting removal is the actual user associated with the provided details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Account Spoofing:** An attacker can spoof another user's details in the removal request, making it appear as though the legitimate user wants to delete their account.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** The attacker can use the spoofed removal request to create a compelling phishing scenario, potentially tricking administrators into deleting legitimate user accounts.
- **Loss of Availability:** The attacker can cause the removal of valid user accounts, impacting the availability of the platform for those users.
- **Administrators Distrust:** The vulnerability makes it hard for administrators to trust the platform-generated user removal emails.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** An attacker can intercept the HTTP request using a proxy tool.
- The attacker manipulates the parameters of the removal request (`userId`, `loginname`, and `email`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the phpMyFAQ system with a low privilege.
- The attacker needs to use a proxy tool to intercept the request sent by the user removal page.
- The attacker needs to know the user ID, login name, and email of the targeted user.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how an attacker can exploit it using a proxy tool (like BurpSuite). It also includes the specific code changes implemented to fix the vulnerability, which are not usually part of a CVE description.
Specifically, the patch adds a check to ensure that the `userId`, `loginName`, and `email` submitted in the request matches the user details of the user making the request.

The information also contains CVSS v3 base metrics:
`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`

The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity.
