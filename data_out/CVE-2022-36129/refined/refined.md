Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36129:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated API endpoint (`/sys/storage/raft/join`) in Vault Enterprise that allows modification of a node's voter status within an Integrated Storage HA cluster. This endpoint does not verify if a node has already joined the cluster or if its voter status has already been set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Authentication:** The `/sys/storage/raft/join` API endpoint does not require authentication to be accessed and used.
- **Missing Validation:** The API does not validate if a node is already part of the cluster or if its voter status has been previously assigned. This allows for repeated calls to the API.
- **Unprotected voter status modification:**  An attacker can repeatedly modify the voter status parameter of a node from `true` to `false`, potentially removing all voters and breaking consensus.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:**  Modifying voter status combined with subsequent node failures can lead to data loss.
- **Catastrophic Failure:** The vulnerability can cause the high availability cluster to become inaccessible, leading to a catastrophic failure.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to remove all voters leading to a denial of service.
- **Increased operational risk:** Modification of voter status increases the operational risk of the cluster

**Attack vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated API Access:** A malicious actor can directly interact with the `/sys/storage/raft/join` API endpoint without needing to authenticate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Vault Enterprise cluster to reach the `/sys/storage/raft/join` API endpoint.
- **Unsealed Node:** The target node must be unsealed for the challenge/response with the leader node to complete.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability affects Vault Enterprise versions 1.7.0 through 1.9.7, 1.10.4, and 1.11.0.
- It is fixed in versions 1.9.8, 1.10.5, and 1.11.1.
- NetApp products incorporate HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise however, they are not affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered CRITICAL with a CVSS score of 9.1.
- The vulnerability was publicly discussed and reported by a third party to HashiCorp.
