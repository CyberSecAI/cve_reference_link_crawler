- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A CWE-552 "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties" vulnerability exists in the web interface of the Tyan S5552 BMC version 3.00. This allows an attacker to retrieve the private key of the TLS certificate used by the BMC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to improper access controls, allowing external parties to access sensitive files (TLS private key) through forced browsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can obtain the private key of the TLS certificate. This allows the attacker to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks against victims accessing the web interface through HTTPS. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. The attacker can access the vulnerable resource through the web interface using forced browsing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Tyan S5552 BMC remotely. The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. User interaction is required for the MitM attack, as it targets victims accessing the web interface.
