- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of a pointer before it is accessed during the parsing of FPJ files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An uninitialized pointer is used when parsing FPJ files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious FPJ file that the victim must open. Alternatively, the target could be lured to visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a malicious file or lure the target to visit a malicious page. The attacker does not require any privileges. User interaction is required in the form of opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page.
