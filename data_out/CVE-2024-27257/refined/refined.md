Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of IBM OpenPages client-side source code information through the use of JavaScript source maps. These source maps, which are meant for debugging, reveal details about the application's structure and logic to unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: JavaScript source maps expose internal application code.
- Information disclosure: The source code revealed can potentially include sensitive details or business logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to source code could assist an attacker in understanding the application's inner workings. This could potentially allow them to find and exploit other vulnerabilities.
- Information disclosure could compromise the confidentiality of the application's proprietary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through access to the publicly available JavaScript source maps, likely through a web browser by accessing a resource that leaks the sourcemap.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and retrieve the source maps from their browser. No special access is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in IBM OpenPages versions 8.3 and 9.0
- The fix involves applying specific Fix Packs and Interim Fixes. For version 8.3, upgrading to 8.3.0.2, then to 8.3.0.2.8 or 8.3.0.3, is required, while for version 9.0, upgrading to 9.0.0.2 or later is needed.
- No customer information is affected.
- There are no workarounds or mitigations except for applying the provided fixes.
