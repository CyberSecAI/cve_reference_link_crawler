Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Yoga Class Registration System v1.0". Specifically, user-supplied data within the message field is not sanitized before being displayed in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system is vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. The vulnerability is present in `/php-ycrs/admin/inquiries/view_inquiry.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain cookies on the target system without authorization. This can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More generally, XSS can enable arbitrary code execution within the user's browser. This can be used to perform a wide range of actions such as data theft, phishing, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to submit a form with XSS payload in the `message` parameter. The provided proof of concept demonstrates this using an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute that executes Javascript when the image fails to load.
*   **Backend Administrator:** The vulnerability is triggered when the backend administrator logs in and views the inquiry containing the malicious payload. This implies that the vulnerable code is in the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any authentication to submit the malicious request.
*   The attacker must be able to send an HTTP request to the contact submission endpoint of the vulnerable application.
* The backend administrator needs to log in to trigger the XSS.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof of concept shows an example of a malicious GET request:
```
GET /php-ycrs/?id=&fullname=123&contact=12321&email=213123%40qq.com&subject=3123&message=%3Cimg+src%3D1+onerror%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%3E HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
```

This request injects the following payload in the `message` parameter:
`<img src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
This will trigger an alert with the cookie if the payload isn't sanitized.
