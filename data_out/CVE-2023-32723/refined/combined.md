Package        : zabbix
Version        : 1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-32721 CVE-2023-32723 CVE-2023-32726
Debian Bug     : 1053877

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in zabbix, a
network monitoring solution, potentially allowing an attacker to perform
a stored XSS, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), exposure of sensitive
information, a system crash, or arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2023-32721

  A stored XSS has been found in the Zabbix web application in the
  Maps element if a URL field is set with spaces before URL.

CVE-2023-32723

  Inefficient user permission check, as request to LDAP is sent before
  user permissions are checked.

CVE-2023-32726

  Possible buffer overread from reading DNS responses.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.

For the detailed security status of zabbix please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zabbix>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
