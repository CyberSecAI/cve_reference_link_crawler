{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the `tee_obj_free` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `calloc` function in `tee_obj_alloc` does not return a zeroed buffer when the heap layout is disturbed. This leads to `free(o->attr)` being called with an invalid pointer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability causes the trusted execution environment kernel to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "A trusted application can exploit the vulnerability by invoking `TEE_AllocateOperation` and `TEE_Realloc` with a large size to disturb the heap layout. Then, `TEE_AllocateOperation` is invoked again leading to a crash.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A trusted application is required to trigger the vulnerability."
