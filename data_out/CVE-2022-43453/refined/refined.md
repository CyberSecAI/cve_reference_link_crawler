- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Tools plugin <= 3.41 lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies but could lead to significant issues.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the plugin's code, allowing an attacker to exploit it via the web interface if the vulnerable plugin is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user on the WordPress website, even a subscriber-level user is sufficient, to exploit the broken access control vulnerability.
