Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which are related to CVE-2024-26787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an imbalance in DMA (Direct Memory Access) mappings within the `mmci_stm32_sdmmc` driver for the STM32 platform. Specifically, `dma_map_sg` (which allocates DMA mappings) was not always paired with a corresponding `dma_unmap_sg` call when errors occurred during the `mmci_cmd_irq` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DMA Mapping Leak:** When an error occurred in the `mmci_cmd_irq` function, the `mmci_dma_error` function would be called. However, on the stm32 variant, `dma_unmap_sg` was not called within the `mmci_dma_error` error path, leading to a DMA mapping leak.
- **Incorrect DMA Management:** The mmc driver for the STM32 platform was missing proper DMA error handling, resulting in a failure to release DMA resources when an error occurred.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary impact was the leak of DMA mappings, which, if occurring repeatedly, could lead to resource exhaustion. This could potentially result in denial-of-service by preventing new allocations.
- **DMA API Debug Warning:** Enabling `CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG_SG` highlights the issue by generating the warning about overlapping mappings. This warning suggests that the driver's DMA management was incorrect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be triggered by any error condition within the mmc driver during a command that utilizes DMA, specifically through the `mmci_cmd_irq` function.
- The specific scenario involves operations such as mmc rescan which uses DMA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to trigger a command on the SD card device that would lead to the error condition in `mmci_cmd_irq`. This requires no special user privileges.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the mmc/sd card interface on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix introduces `sdmmc_idma_error`, which calls `dma_unmap_sg` to free the DMA mappings in the error path and addresses the issue.
- The fix also sets the `dma_in_progress` flag to ensure that `sdmmc_idma_error` does not attempt to double free and that only one call is made to dma_unmap_sg per request.
- The fix also ensures `dma_unmap_sg` is only called if `use_bounce_buffer` is false.
