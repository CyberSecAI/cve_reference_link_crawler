Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The markdown editor was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input, specifically when rendering certain HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application failed to sanitize HTML elements, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- Specifically, the `<EMBED>` tag with a `data:` URI for SVG, and the `<sup>` and `<abbr>` tags with `onmouseover` attributes were not sanitized.
- The `AllowScriptAccess` attribute was not properly handled which contributed to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could lead to:
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Defacement of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML code using the vulnerable tags within the markdown editor.
- The specific tags and attributes used for the attack are `<EMBED SRC="data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` , `<sup style="position:fixed;... onmouseover="alert('xss')">sup</sup>` and `<abbr style="position:fixed;... onmouseover="alert('xss')">abbr</abbr>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to input markdown text into the editor.
- No special permissions are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by:
- Implementing a regular expression to match HTML elements with `AllowScriptAccess` attributes set to `always` or `sameDomain` or having an attribute with an `on` prefix.
- Removing all matching elements from the user provided markdown text before rendering the HTML.
- Alerting the user if any of their input was removed due to containing potential XSS.
