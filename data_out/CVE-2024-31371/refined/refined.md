- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress WP Event Aggregator plugin, in versions up to 1.7.6, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin under their current authentication. The specific impact depends on the actions the targeted user is able to perform within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request that is triggered when a logged-in user visits a malicious site or link, or interacts with attacker controlled content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into triggering a crafted request. This requires social engineering to some extent. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target site.
