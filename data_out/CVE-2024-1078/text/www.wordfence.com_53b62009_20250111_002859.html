### Description

The Quiz Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ays\_quick\_start() and add\_question\_rows() functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary quizzes.
