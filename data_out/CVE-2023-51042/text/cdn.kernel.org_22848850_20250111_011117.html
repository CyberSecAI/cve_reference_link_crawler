net: fix the RTO timer retransmitting skb every 1ms if linear option is enabled
commit e4dd0d3a2f64b8bd8029ec70f52bdbebd0644408 upstream.
In the real workload, I encountered an issue which could cause the RTO
timer to retransmit the skb per 1ms with linear option enabled. The amount
of lost-retransmitted skbs can go up to 1000+ instantly.
The root cause is that if the icsk\_rto happens to be zero in the 6th round
(which is the TCP\_THIN\_LINEAR\_RETRIES value), then it will always be zero
due to the changed calculation method in tcp\_retransmit\_timer() as follows:
icsk->icsk\_rto = min(icsk->icsk\_rto << 1, TCP\_RTO\_MAX);
Above line could be converted to
icsk->icsk\_rto = min(0 << 1, TCP\_RTO\_MAX) = 0
Therefore, the timer expires so quickly without any doubt.
I read through the RFC 6298 and found that the RTO value can be rounded
up to a certain value, in Linux, say TCP\_RTO\_MIN as default, which is
regarded as the lower bound in this patch as suggested by Eric.

af\_unix: Fix null-ptr-deref in unix\_stream\_sendpage().
Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng reported null-ptr-deref in unix\_stream\_sendpage()
with detailed analysis and a nice repro.
unix\_stream\_sendpage() tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's
recv queue without locking the queue.
If the peer's FD is passed to another socket and the socket's FD is
passed to the peer, there is a loop between them. If we close both
sockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage
collection.
The garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with
FD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.
So, there is a race where unix\_stream\_sendpage() could access an skb
locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in
use-after-free.
To avoid the issue, unix\_stream\_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv
queue.
Note the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()
refactoring.
This patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.

drm/amd: flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry
commit a7b7d9e8aee4f71b4c7151702fd74237b8cef989 upstream.
DCN 3.1.4 is reported to hang on s2idle entry if graphics activity
is happening during entry. This is because GFXOFF was scheduled as
delayed but RLC gets disabled in s2idle entry sequence which will
hang GFX IP if not already in GFXOFF.
To help this problem, flush any delayed work for GFXOFF early in
s2idle entry sequence to ensure that it's off when RLC is changed.
commit 4b31b92b143f ("drm/amdgpu: complete gfxoff allow signal during
suspend without delay") modified power gating flow so that if called
in s0ix that it ensured that GFXOFF wasn't put in work queue but
instead processed immediately.
This is dead code due to commit 10cb67eb8a1b ("drm/amdgpu: skip
CG/PG for gfx during S0ix") because GFXOFF will now not be explicitly
called as part of the suspend entry code. Remove that dead code.

Commit ca62297b2085 ("drm/edid: Fix csync detailed mode parsing") fixed
EDID detailed mode sync parsing. Unfortunately, there are quite a few
displays out there that have bogus (zero) sync field that are broken by
the change. Zero means analog composite sync, which is not right for
digital displays, and the modes get rejected. Regardless, it used to
work, and it needs to continue to work. Revert the change.
Rejecting modes with analog composite sync was the part that fixed the
gitlab issue 8146 [1]. We'll need to get back to the drawing board with
that.

drm/qxl: fix UAF on handle creation
commit c611589b4259ed63b9b77be6872b1ce07ec0ac16 upstream.
qxl\_mode\_dumb\_create() dereferences the qobj returned by
qxl\_gem\_object\_create\_with\_handle(), but the handle is the only one
holding a reference to it.
A potential attacker could guess the returned handle value and closes it
between the return of qxl\_gem\_object\_create\_with\_handle() and the qobj
usage, triggering a use-after-free scenario.
Reproducer:
int dri\_fd =-1;
struct drm\_mode\_create\_dumb arg = {0};
void gem\_close(int handle);
void\* trigger(void\* ptr)
{
int ret;
arg.width = arg.height = 0x20;

Disabling lock debugging due to kernel taint
Instead of returning a weak reference to the qxl\_bo object, return the
created drm\_gem\_object and let the caller decrement the reference count
when it no longer needs it. As a convenience, if the caller is not
interested in the gobj object, it can pass NULL to the parameter and the
reference counting is descremented internally.
The bug and the reproducer were originally found by the Zero Day Initiative project (ZDI-CAN-20940).

mmc: sunplus: Fix error handling in spmmc\_drv\_probe()
commit cf3f15b8c6601c1dc70f85949788ee993dd9a439 upstream.
When mmc allocation succeeds, the error paths are not freeing mmc.
Fix the above issue by changing mmc\_alloc\_host() to devm\_mmc\_alloc\_host()
to simplify the error handling. Remove label 'probe\_free\_host' as devm\_\*
api takes care of freeing, also remove mmc\_free\_host() from remove
function as devm\_\* takes care of freeing.

mmc: sunplus: fix return value check of mmc\_add\_host()
commit dce6d8f985fa1ef5c2af47f4f86ea65511b78656 upstream.
mmc\_add\_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value,
1. the memory allocated in mmc\_alloc\_host() will be leaked
2. null-ptr-deref will happen when calling mmc\_remove\_host()
in remove function spmmc\_drv\_remove() because deleting not
added device.
Fix this by checking the return value of mmc\_add\_host(). Moreover,
I fixed the error handling path of spmmc\_drv\_probe() to clean up.

and a large number of requests could not be sent.

When commit 716c330433e3 ("media: uvcvideo: Use standard names for

replaced a GENMASK(n - 1, 0) with a BIT\_MASK(n). The latter isn't

blk-crypto: dynamically allocate fallback profile
commit c984ff1423ae9f70b1f28ce811856db0d9c99021 upstream.
blk\_crypto\_profile\_init() calls lockdep\_register\_key(), which warns and
does not register if the provided memory is a static object.
blk-crypto-fallback currently has a static blk\_crypto\_profile and calls
blk\_crypto\_profile\_init() thereupon, resulting in the warning and
failure to register.
Fortunately it is simple enough to use a dynamically allocated profile
and make lockdep function correctly.

arm64/ptrace: Ensure that the task sees ZT writes on first use
commit 2f43f549cd0b3164ea0345e59aa3958c0d243383 upstream.
When the value of ZT is set via ptrace we don't disable traps for SME.
This means that when a the task has never used SME before then the value
set via ptrace will never be seen by the target task since it will
trigger a SME access trap which will flush the register state.
Disable SME traps when setting ZT, this means we also need to allocate
storage for SVE if it is not already allocated, for the benefit of
streaming SVE.

arm64/ptrace: Ensure that SME is set up for target when writing SSVE state
commit 5d0a8d2fba50e9c07cde4aad7fba28c008b07a5b upstream.
When we use NT\_ARM\_SSVE to either enable streaming mode or change the
vector length for a process we do not currently do anything to ensure that
there is storage allocated for the SME specific register state. If the
task had not previously used SME or we changed the vector length then
the task will not have had TIF\_SME set or backing storage for ZA/ZT
allocated, resulting in inconsistent register sizes when saving state
and spurious traps which flush the newly set register state.
We should set TIF\_SME to disable traps and ensure that storage is
allocated for ZA and ZT if it is not already allocated. This requires
modifying sme\_alloc() to make the flush of any existing register state
optional so we don't disturb existing state for ZA and ZT.

arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Wifi/Bluetooth on ROCK Pi 4 boards
commit ebceec271e552a2b05e47d8ef0597052b1a39449 upstream.
This patch fixes an issue affecting the Wifi/Bluetooth connectivity on
ROCK Pi 4 boards. Commit f471b1b2db08 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix Bluetooth
on ROCK Pi 4 boards") introduced a problem with the clock configuration.
Specifically, the clock-names property of the sdio-pwrseq node was not
updated to 'lpo', causing the driver to wait indefinitely for the wrong clock
signal 'ext\_clock' instead of the expected one 'lpo'. This prevented the proper
initialization of Wifi/Bluetooth chip on ROCK Pi 4 boards.
To address this, this patch updates the clock-names property of the
sdio-pwrseq node to "lpo" to align with the changes made to the bluetooth node.
This patch has been tested on ROCK Pi 4B.

virtio-net: Zero max\_tx\_vq field for VIRTIO\_NET\_CTRL\_MQ\_HASH\_CONFIG case
commit 2c507ce90e02cd78d00fd4b0fe26c8641873c13f upstream.
Kernel uses `struct virtio\_net\_ctrl\_rss` to save command-specific-data
for both the VIRTIO\_NET\_CTRL\_MQ\_HASH\_CONFIG and
VIRTIO\_NET\_CTRL\_MQ\_RSS\_CONFIG commands.
According to the VirtIO standard, "Field reserved MUST contain zeroes.
It is defined to make the structure to match the layout of
virtio\_net\_rss\_config structure, defined in 5.1.6.5.7.".
Yet for the VIRTIO\_NET\_CTRL\_MQ\_HASH\_CONFIG command case, the `max\_tx\_vq`
field in struct virtio\_net\_ctrl\_rss, which corresponds to the
`reserved` field in struct virtio\_net\_hash\_config, is not zeroed,
thereby violating the VirtIO standard.
This patch solves this problem by zeroing this field in
virtnet\_init\_default\_rss().

regulator: da9063: better fix null deref with partial DT
commit 30c694fd4a99fbbc4115d180156ca01b60953371 upstream.
Two versions of the original patch were sent but V1 was merged instead
of V2 due to a mistake.
So update to V2.
The advantage of V2 is that it completely avoids dereferencing the pointer,
even just to take the address, which may fix problems with some compilers.
Both versions work on my gcc 9.4 but use the safer one.

parisc: Fix CONFIG\_TLB\_PTLOCK to work with lightweight spinlock checks
commit 7a894c87374771f3cfb1b8e5453fbe03f1fb8135 upstream.
For the TLB\_PTLOCK checks we used an optimization to store the spc
register into the spinlock to unlock it. This optimization works as
long as the lightweight spinlock checks (CONFIG\_LIGHTWEIGHT\_SPINLOCK\_CHECK)
aren't enabled, because they really check if the lock word is zero or
\_\_ARCH\_SPIN\_LOCK\_UNLOCKED\_VAL and abort with a kernel crash
("Spinlock was trashed") otherwise.
Drop that optimization to make it possible to activate both checks
at the same time.

cifs: Release folio lock on fscache read hit.
commit 69513dd669e243928f7450893190915a88f84a2b upstream.
Under the current code, when cifs\_readpage\_worker is called, the call
contract is that the callee should unlock the page. This is documented
in the read\_folio section of Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst as:
> The filesystem should unlock the folio once the read has completed,
> whether it was successful or not.
Without this change, when fscache is in use and cache hit occurs during
a read, the page lock is leaked, producing the following stack on
subsequent reads (via mmap) to the page:
$ cat /proc/3890/task/12864/stack
[<0>] folio\_wait\_bit\_common+0x124/0x350
[<0>] filemap\_read\_folio+0xad/0xf0
[<0>] filemap\_fault+0x8b1/0xab0
[<0>] \_\_do\_fault+0x39/0x150
[<0>] do\_fault+0x25c/0x3e0
[<0>] \_\_handle\_mm\_fault+0x6ca/0xc70
[<0>] handle\_mm\_fault+0xe9/0x350
[<0>] do\_user\_addr\_fault+0x225/0x6c0
[<0>] exc\_page\_fault+0x84/0x1b0
[<0>] asm\_exc\_page\_fault+0x27/0x30
This requires a reboot to resolve; it is a deadlock.
Note however that the call to cifs\_readpage\_from\_fscache does mark the
page clean, but does not free the folio lock. This happens in
\_\_cifs\_readpage\_from\_fscache on success. Releasing the lock at that
point however is not appropriate as cifs\_readahead also calls
cifs\_readpage\_from\_fscache and \*does\* unconditionally release the lock
after its return. This change therefore effectively makes
cifs\_readpage\_worker work like cifs\_readahead.

driver has initialized port->pm function, we need to clear port->pm too.

riscv: uaccess: Return the number of bytes effectively not copied
[ Upstream commit 4b05b993900dd3eba0fc83ef5c5ddc7d65d786c6 ]
It was reported that the riscv kernel hangs while executing the test
in [1].
Indeed, the test hangs when trying to write a buffer to a file. The
problem is that the riscv implementation of raw\_copy\_from\_user() does not
return the correct number of bytes not written when an exception happens
and is fixed up, instead it always returns the initial size to copy,
even if some bytes were actually copied.
generic\_perform\_write() pre-faults the user pages and bails out if nothing
can be written, otherwise it will access the userspace buffer: here the
riscv implementation keeps returning it was not able to copy any byte
though the pre-faulting indicates otherwise. So generic\_perform\_write()
keeps retrying to access the user memory and ends up in an infinite
loop.
Note that before the commit mentioned in [1] that introduced this
regression, it worked because generic\_perform\_write() would bail out if
only one byte could not be written.
So fix this by returning the number of bytes effectively not written in
\_\_asm\_copy\_[to|from]\_user() and \_\_clear\_user(), as it is expected.

riscv: entry: set a0 = -ENOSYS only when syscall != -1
[ Upstream commit 52449c17bdd1540940e21511612b58acebc49c06 ]
When we test seccomp with 6.4 kernel, we found errno has wrong value.
If we deny NETLINK\_AUDIT with EAFNOSUPPORT, after f0bddf50586d, we will
get ENOSYS instead. We got same result with commit 9c2598d43510 ("riscv:
entry: Save a0 prior syscall\_enter\_from\_user\_mode()").
After analysing code, we think that regs->a0 = -ENOSYS should only be
executed when syscall != -1. In \_\_seccomp\_filter, when seccomp rejected
this syscall with specified errno, they will set a0 to return number as
syscall ABI, and then return -1. This return number is finally pass as
return number of syscall\_enter\_from\_user\_mode, and then is compared with
NR\_syscalls after converted to ulong (so it will be ULONG\_MAX). The
condition syscall < NR\_syscalls will always be false, so regs->a0 = -ENOSYS
is always executed. It covered a0 set by seccomp, so we always get
ENOSYS when match seccomp RET\_ERRNO rule.

In accordance to these updates, a new intr\_target\_width member is

width of intr\_target field in the interrupt configuration register. This
value is used to dynamically calculate and generate mask for setting the
intr\_target field. By default, this mask is set to 3 bit wide, to ensure

ASoC: meson: axg-tdm-formatter: fix channel slot allocation
[ Upstream commit c1f848f12103920ca165758aedb1c10904e193e1 ]
When the tdm lane mask is computed, the driver currently fills the 1st lane
before moving on to the next. If the stream has less channels than the
lanes can accommodate, slots will be disabled on the last lanes.
Unfortunately, the HW distribute channels in a different way. It distribute
channels in pair on each lanes before moving on the next slots.
This difference leads to problems if a device has an interface with more
than 1 lane and with more than 2 slots per lane.
For example: a playback interface with 2 lanes and 4 slots each (total 8
slots - zero based numbering)
- Playing a 8ch stream:
- All slots activated by the driver
- channel #2 will be played on lane #1 - slot #0 following HW placement
- Playing a 4ch stream:
- Lane #1 disabled by the driver
- channel #2 will be played on lane #0 - slot #2
This behaviour is obviously not desirable.
Change the way slots are activated on the TDM lanes to follow what the HW
does and make sure each channel always get mapped to the same slot/lane.

arm64: dts: imx8mm: Drop CSI1 PHY reference clock configuration
[ Upstream commit f02b53375e8f14b4c27a14f6e4fb6e89914fdc29 ]
The CSI1 PHY reference clock is limited to 125 MHz according to:
i.MX 8M Mini Applications Processor Reference Manual, Rev. 3, 11/2020
Table 5-1. Clock Root Table (continued) / page 307
Slice Index n = 123 .
Currently the IMX8MM\_CLK\_CSI1\_PHY\_REF clock is configured to be
fed directly from 1 GHz PLL2 , which overclocks them. Instead, drop
the configuration altogether, which defaults the clock to 24 MHz REF
clock input, which for the PHY reference clock is just fine.
Based on a patch from Marek Vasut for the imx8mn.

The commit 3a786086c6f8 ("arm64: dts: qcom: Add missing "-thermal"
suffix for thermal zones") renamed the thermal zone in the pm8150l.dtsi
file to comply with the schema. However this resulted in a clash with
the RB5 board file, which already contained the pm8150l-thermal zone for
the on-board sensor. This resulted in the board file definition
overriding the thermal zone defined in the PMIC include file (and thus
the on-die PMIC temp alarm was not probing at all).
Rename the thermal zone in qcom/qrb5165-rb5.dts to remove this override.

bus: ti-sysc: Flush posted write on enable before reset
[ Upstream commit 34539b442b3bc7d5bf10164750302b60b91f18a7 ]
The am335x devices started producing boot errors for resetting musb module
in because of subtle timing changes:
Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x1008)
...
sysc\_poll\_reset\_sysconfig from sysc\_reset+0x109/0x12
sysc\_reset from sysc\_probe+0xa99/0xeb0
...
The fix is to flush posted write after enable before reset during
probe. Note that some devices also need to specify the delay after enable
with ti,sysc-delay-us, but this is not needed for musb on am335x based on
my tests.

qede: fix firmware halt over suspend and resume
[ Upstream commit 2eb9625a3a32251ecea470cd576659a3a03b4e59 ]
While performing certain power-off sequences, PCI drivers are
called to suspend and resume their underlying devices through
PCI PM (power management) interface. However this NIC hardware
does not support PCI PM suspend/resume operations so system wide
suspend/resume leads to bad MFW (management firmware) state which
causes various follow-up errors in driver when communicating with
the device/firmware afterwards.
To fix this driver implements PCI PM suspend handler to indicate
unsupported operation to the PCI subsystem explicitly, thus avoiding
system to go into suspended/standby mode.
Without this fix device/firmware does not recover unless system
is power cycled.

sock: Fix misuse of sk\_under\_memory\_pressure()
[ Upstream commit 2d0c88e84e483982067a82073f6125490ddf3614 ]
The status of global socket memory pressure is updated when:
a) \_\_sk\_mem\_raise\_allocated():
enter: sk\_memory\_allocated(sk) > sysctl\_mem[1]
leave: sk\_memory\_allocated(sk) <= sysctl\_mem[0]
b) \_\_sk\_mem\_reduce\_allocated():
leave: sk\_under\_memory\_pressure(sk) &&
sk\_memory\_allocated(sk) < sysctl\_mem[0]
So the conditions of leaving global pressure are inconstant, which
may lead to the situation that one pressured net-memcg prevents the
global pressure from being cleared when there is indeed no global
pressure, thus the global constrains are still in effect unexpectedly
on the other sockets.
This patch fixes this by ignoring the net-memcg's pressure when
deciding whether should leave global memory pressure.

sfc: add fallback action-set-lists for TC offload
[ Upstream commit e16ca7fb9ffb0d51ddf01e450a1043ea65b5be3f ]
When offloading a TC encap action, the action information for the
hardware might not be "ready": if there's currently no neighbour entry
available for the destination address, we can't construct the Ethernet
header to prepend to the packet. In this case, we still offload the
flow rule, but with its action-set-list ID pointing at a "fallback"
action which simply delivers the packet to its default destination (as
though no flow rule had matched), thus allowing software TC to handle
it. Later, when we receive a neighbouring update that allows us to
construct the encap header, the rule will become "ready" and we will
update its action-set-list ID in hardware to point at the actual
offloaded actions.
This patch sets up these fallback ASLs, but does not yet use them.

[ Upstream commit 23d775f12dcd23d052a4927195f15e970e27ab26 ]
If the switch is reset during active EEPROM transactions, as in
just after an SoC reset after power up, the I2C bus transaction
may be cut short leaving the EEPROM internal I2C state machine
in the wrong state. When the switch is reset again, the bad
state machine state may result in data being read from the wrong
memory location causing the switch to enter unexpected mode
rendering it inoperational.

net/mlx5e: XDP, Fix fifo overrun on XDP\_REDIRECT
[ Upstream commit 34a79876d9f77e971115236bcf7b5d14a8ecf542 ]
Before this fix, running high rate traffic through XDP\_REDIRECT
with multibuf could overrun the fifo used to release the
xdp frames after tx completion. This resulted in corrupted data
being consumed on the free side.
The culplirt was a miscalculation of the fifo size: the maximum ratio
between fifo entries / data segments was incorrect. This ratio serves to
calculate the max fifo size for a full sq where each packet uses the
worst case number of entries in the fifo.
This patch fixes the formula and names the constant. It also makes sure
that future values will use a power of 2 number of entries for the fifo
mask to work.

net: openvswitch: reject negative ifindex

Recent changes in net-next (commit 759ab1edb56c ("net: store netdevs

and let syzbot surface a latent problem in ovs. ovs does not validate
ifindex, making it possible to create netdev ports with negative
ifindex values. It's easy to repro with YNL:
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs\_datapath.yaml \
--do new \
--json '{"upcall-pid": 1, "name":"my-dp"}'
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs\_vport.yaml \
--do new \
--json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'
$ ip link show

link/ether 7a:48:21:ad:0b:fb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Validate the inputs. Now the second command correctly returns:

netfilter: set default timeout to 3 secs for sctp shutdown send and recv state
[ Upstream commit 9bfab6d23a2865966a4f89a96536fbf23f83bc8c ]
In SCTP protocol, it is using the same timer (T2 timer) for SHUTDOWN and
SHUTDOWN\_ACK retransmission. However in sctp conntrack the default timeout
value for SCTP\_CONNTRACK\_SHUTDOWN\_ACK\_SENT state is 3 secs while it's 300
msecs for SCTP\_CONNTRACK\_SHUTDOWN\_SEND/RECV state.
As Paolo Valerio noticed, this might cause unwanted expiration of the ct
entry. In my test, with 1s tc netem delay set on the NAT path, after the
SHUTDOWN is sent, the sctp ct entry enters SCTP\_CONNTRACK\_SHUTDOWN\_SEND
state. However, due to 300ms (too short) delay, when the SHUTDOWN\_ACK is
sent back from the peer, the sctp ct entry has expired and been deleted,
and then the SHUTDOWN\_ACK has to be dropped.
Also, it is confusing these two sysctl options always show 0 due to all
timeout values using sec as unit:
net.netfilter.nf\_conntrack\_sctp\_timeout\_shutdown\_recd = 0
net.netfilter.nf\_conntrack\_sctp\_timeout\_shutdown\_sent = 0
This patch fixes it by also using 3 secs for sctp shutdown send and recv
state in sctp conntrack, which is also RTO.initial value in SCTP protocol.
Note that the very short time value for SCTP\_CONNTRACK\_SHUTDOWN\_SEND/RECV
was probably used for a rare scenario where SHUTDOWN is sent on 1st path
but SHUTDOWN\_ACK is replied on 2nd path, then a new connection started
immediately on 1st path. So this patch also moves from SHUTDOWN\_SEND/RECV
to CLOSE when receiving INIT in the ORIGINAL direction.

Expected: 0-2 . 0-3, got:
W: [FAILED] ./testcases/sets/0044interval\_overlap\_0: got 1
Insertion must ignore duplicate but expired entries.
Moreover, there is a strange asymmetry in nft\_pipapo\_activate:
It refetches the current element, whereas the other ->activate callbacks
(bitmap, hash, rhash, rbtree) use elem->priv.
Same for .remove: other set implementations take elem->priv,
nft\_pipapo\_remove fetches elem->priv, then does a relookup,
remove this.
I suspect this was the reason for the change that prompted the
removal of the expired check in pipapo\_get() in the first place,
but skipping exired elements there makes no sense to me, this helper
is used for normal get requests, insertions (duplicate check)
and deactivate callback.
In first two cases expired elements must be skipped.
For ->deactivate(), this gets called for DELSETELEM, so it
seems to me that expired elements should be skipped as well, i.e.
delete request should fail with -ENOENT error.

accel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map\_user\_pages()
[ Upstream commit 96d3c1cadedb6ae2e8965e19cd12caa244afbd9c ]
The encode\_dma() function has some validation on in\_trans->size but it
would be more clear to move those checks to find\_and\_map\_user\_pages().
The encode\_dma() had two checks:
if (in\_trans->addr + in\_trans->size < in\_trans->addr || !in\_trans->size)
return -EINVAL;
The in\_trans->addr variable is the starting address. The in\_trans->size
variable is the total size of the transfer. The transfer can occur in
parts and the resources->xferred\_dma\_size tracks how many bytes we have
already transferred.
This patch introduces a new variable "remaining" which represents the
amount we want to transfer (in\_trans->size) minus the amount we have
already transferred (resources->xferred\_dma\_size).
I have modified the check for if in\_trans->size is zero to instead check
if in\_trans->size is less than resources->xferred\_dma\_size. If we have
already transferred more bytes than in\_trans->size then there are negative
bytes remaining which doesn't make sense. If there are zero bytes
remaining to be copied, just return success.
The check in encode\_dma() checked that "addr + size" could not overflow
and barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if
we do this in parts. First check that "in\_trans->addr +
resources->xferred\_dma\_size" is safe. Then check that "xfer\_start\_addr +
remaining" is safe.
My final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit
systems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits. So
I calculated "total = in\_trans->size + offset\_in\_page(xfer\_start\_addr);"
and returned -EINVAL if it were >= SIZE\_MAX. This will not affect 64bit
systems.

[ Upstream commit 8a519a572598b7c0c07b02f69bf5b4e8dd4b2d7d ]
The failure handling procedure destroys page pools for all queues,
including those that haven't had their page pool created yet. this patch
introduces necessary adjustments to prevent potential risks and
inconsistency with the error handling behavior.

octeon\_ep: cancel queued works in probe error path
[ Upstream commit 758c91078165ae641b698750a72eafe7968b3756 ]
If it fails to get the devices's MAC address, octep\_probe exits while
leaving the delayed work intr\_poll\_task queued. When the work later
runs, it's a use after free.
Move the cancelation of intr\_poll\_task from octep\_remove into
octep\_device\_cleanup. This does not change anything in the octep\_remove
flow, but octep\_device\_cleanup is called also in the octep\_probe error
path, where the cancelation is needed.
Note that the cancelation of ctrl\_mbox\_task has to follow
intr\_poll\_task's, because the ctrl\_mbox\_task may be queued by
intr\_poll\_task.

net: macb: In ZynqMP resume always configure PS GTR for non-wakeup source
[ Upstream commit 6c461e394d11a981c662cc16cebfb05b602e23ba ]
On Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ubuntu platform when systemctl issues suspend,
network manager bring down the interface and goes into suspend. When it
wakes up it again enables the interface.
This leads to xilinx-psgtr "PLL lock timeout" on interface bringup, as
the power management controller power down the entire FPD (including
SERDES) if none of the FPD devices are in use and serdes is not
initialized on resume.
$ sudo rtcwake -m no -s 120 -v
$ sudo systemctl suspend
$ ifconfig eth1 up
xilinx-psgtr fd400000.phy: lane 0 (type 10, protocol 5): PLL lock timeout
phy phy-fd400000.phy.0: phy poweron failed --> -110
macb driver is called in this way:
1. macb\_close: Stop network interface. In this function, it
reset MACB IP and disables PHY and network interface.
2. macb\_suspend: It is called in kernel suspend flow. But because
network interface has been disabled(netif\_running(ndev) is
false), it does nothing and returns directly;
3. System goes into suspend state. Some time later, system is
waken up by RTC wakeup device;
4. macb\_resume: It does nothing because network interface has
been disabled;
5. macb\_open: It is called to enable network interface again. ethernet
interface is initialized in this API but serdes which is power-off
by PMUFW during FPD-off suspend is not initialized again and so
we hit GT PLL lock issue on open.
To resolve this PLL timeout issue always do PS GTR initialization
when ethernet device is configured as non-wakeup source.

drm/i915/guc/slpc: Restore efficient freq earlier
[ Upstream commit 5598c9bfdb81f40f2f5d769b342d25bff74b07a6 ]
This should be done before the soft min/max frequencies are restored.
When we disable the "Ignore efficient frequency" flag, GuC does not
actually bring the requested freq down to RPn.
Specifically, this scenario-
- ignore efficient freq set to true
- reduce min to RPn (from efficient)
- suspend
- resume (includes GuC load, restore soft min/max, restore efficient freq)
- validate min freq has been resored to RPn
This will fail if we didn't first restore(disable, in this case) efficient
freq flag before setting the soft min frequency.
v2: Bring the min freq down to RPn when we disable efficient freq (Rodrigo)
Also made the change to set the min softlimit to RPn at init. Otherwise, we
were storing RPe there.

drm/panel: simple: Fix AUO G121EAN01 panel timings according to the docs

Commit 03e909acd95a ("drm/panel: simple: Add support for AUO G121EAN01.4

are very different from what the datasheet describes. I checked both the
G121EAN01.0 datasheet from [0] and the G121EAN01.4 one from [1] and they
all have the same timings: for example the LVDS clock typical value is 74.4
MHz, not 66.7 MHz as implemented.
Replace the timings with the ones from the documentation. These timings
have been tested and the clock frequencies verified with an oscilloscope to
ensure they are correct.
Also use struct display\_timing instead of struct drm\_display\_mode in order
to also specify the minimum and maximum values.

selftests: mirror\_gre\_changes: Tighten up the TTL test match
[ Upstream commit 855067defa36b1f9effad8c219d9a85b655cf500 ]
This test verifies whether the encapsulated packets have the correct
configured TTL. It does so by sending ICMP packets through the test
topology and mirroring them to a gretap netdevice. On a busy host
however, more than just the test ICMP packets may end up flowing
through the topology, get mirrored, and counted. This leads to
potential spurious failures as the test observes much more mirrored
packets than the sent test packets, and assumes a bug.
Fix this by tightening up the mirror action match. Change it from
matchall to a flower classifier matching on ICMP packets specifically.

net: phy: fix IRQ-based wake-on-lan over hibernate / power off
[ Upstream commit cc941e548bffc01b5816b4edc5cb432a137a58b3 ]
Uwe reports:
"Most PHYs signal WoL using an interrupt. So disabling interrupts [at
shutdown] breaks WoL at least on PHYs covered by the marvell driver."
Discussing with Ioana, the problem which was trying to be solved was:
"The board in question is a LS1021ATSN which has two AR8031 PHYs that
share an interrupt line. In case only one of the PHYs is probed and
there are pending interrupts on the PHY#2 an IRQ storm will happen
since there is no entity to clear the interrupt from PHY#2's registers.
PHY#1's driver will get stuck in .handle\_interrupt() indefinitely."
Further confirmation that "the two AR8031 PHYs are on the same MDIO
bus."
With WoL using interrupts to wake the system, in such a case, the
system will begin booting with an asserted interrupt. Thus, we need to
cope with an interrupt asserted during boot.
Solve this instead by disabling interrupts during PHY probe. This will
ensure in Ioana's situation that both PHYs of the same type sharing an
interrupt line on a common MDIO bus will have their interrupt outputs
disabled when the driver probes the device, but before we hook in any
interrupt handlers - thus avoiding the interrupt storm.
A better fix would be for platform firmware to disable the interrupting
devices at source during boot, before control is handed to the kernel.

xfrm: add forgotten nla\_policy for XFRMA\_MTIMER\_THRESH
[ Upstream commit 5e2424708da7207087934c5c75211e8584d553a0 ]
The previous commit 4e484b3e969b ("xfrm: rate limit SA mapping change
message to user space") added one additional attribute named
XFRMA\_MTIMER\_THRESH and described its type at compat\_policy
(net/xfrm/xfrm\_compat.c).
However, the author forgot to also describe the nla\_policy at
xfrma\_policy (net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c). Hence, this suppose NLA\_U32 (4
bytes) value can be faked as empty (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which
leads to 4 bytes overflow read and heap information leak when parsing
nlattrs.
To exploit this, one malicious user can spray the SLUB objects and then
leverage this 4 bytes OOB read to leak the heap data into
x->mapping\_maxage (see xfrm\_update\_ae\_params(...)), and leak it to
userspace via copy\_to\_user\_state\_extra(...).
The above bug is assigned CVE-2023-3773. To fix it, this commit just
completes the nla\_policy description for XFRMA\_MTIMER\_THRESH, which
enforces the length check and avoids such OOB read.

slab-use-after-free may occur when ip\_vti device sends IPv6 packets.
As commit f855691975bb ("xfrm6: Fix the nexthdr offset in
\_decode\_session6.") showed, xfrm\_decode\_session was originally intended
only for the receive path. IP6CB(skb)->nhoff is not set during
transmission. Therefore, set the cb field in the skb to 0 before
sending packets.

xfrm: Silence warnings triggerable by bad packets
[ Upstream commit 57010b8ece2821a1fdfdba2197d14a022f3769db ]
After the elimination of inner modes, a couple of warnings that
were previously unreachable can now be triggered by malformed
inbound packets.
Fix this by:
1. Moving the setting of skb->protocol into the decap functions.
2. Returning -EINVAL when unexpected protocol is seen.

net: xfrm: Amend XFRMA\_SEC\_CTX nla\_policy structure
[ Upstream commit d1e0e61d617ba17aa516db707aa871387566bbf7 ]
According to all consumers code of attrs[XFRMA\_SEC\_CTX], like
\* verify\_sec\_ctx\_len(), convert to xfrm\_user\_sec\_ctx\*
\* xfrm\_state\_construct(), call security\_xfrm\_state\_alloc whose prototype
is int security\_xfrm\_state\_alloc(.., struct xfrm\_user\_sec\_ctx \*sec\_ctx);
\* copy\_from\_user\_sec\_ctx(), convert to xfrm\_user\_sec\_ctx \*
...
It seems that the expected parsing result for XFRMA\_SEC\_CTX should be
structure xfrm\_user\_sec\_ctx, and the current xfrm\_sec\_ctx is confusing
and misleading (Luckily, they happen to have same size 8 bytes).
This commit amend the policy structure to xfrm\_user\_sec\_ctx to avoid
ambiguity.

By investigating the code, we find the root cause of this OOB is the lack
of checks in xfrm\_dump\_sa(). The buggy code allows a malicious user to pass
arbitrary value of filter->splen/dplen. Hence, with crafted xfrm states,
the attacker can achieve 8 bytes heap OOB read, which causes info leak.
if (attrs[XFRMA\_ADDRESS\_FILTER]) {
filter = kmemdup(nla\_data(attrs[XFRMA\_ADDRESS\_FILTER]),
sizeof(\*filter), GFP\_KERNEL);
if (filter == NULL)
return -ENOMEM;
// NO MORE CHECKS HERE !!!
}
This patch fixes the OOB by adding necessary boundary checks, just like
the code in pfkey\_dump() function.

x86/retpoline,kprobes: Skip optprobe check for indirect jumps with retpolines and IBT
commit 833fd800bf56b74d39d71d3f5936dffb3e0409c6 upstream.
The kprobes optimization check can\_optimize() calls
insn\_is\_indirect\_jump() to detect indirect jump instructions in
a target function. If any is found, creating an optprobe is disallowed
in the function because the jump could be from a jump table and could
potentially land in the middle of the target optprobe.
With retpolines, insn\_is\_indirect\_jump() additionally looks for calls to
indirect thunks which the compiler potentially used to replace original
jumps. This extra check is however unnecessary because jump tables are
disabled when the kernel is built with retpolines. The same is currently
the case with IBT.
Based on this observation, remove the logic to look for calls to
indirect thunks and skip the check for indirect jumps altogether if the
kernel is built with retpolines or IBT. Remove subsequently the symbols
\_\_indirect\_thunk\_start and \_\_indirect\_thunk\_end which are no longer
needed.
Dropping this logic indirectly fixes a problem where the range
[\_\_indirect\_thunk\_start, \_\_indirect\_thunk\_end] wrongly included also the
return thunk. It caused that machines which used the return thunk as
a mitigation and didn't have it patched by any alternative ended up not
being able to use optprobes in any regular function.

x86/retpoline,kprobes: Fix position of thunk sections with CONFIG\_LTO\_CLANG
commit 79cd2a11224eab86d6673fe8a11d2046ae9d2757 upstream.
The linker script arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S matches the thunk
sections ".text.\_\_x86.\*" from arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S as follows:
.text {
[...]
TEXT\_TEXT
[...]
\_\_indirect\_thunk\_start = .;
\*(.text.\_\_x86.\*)
\_\_indirect\_thunk\_end = .;
[...]
}
Macro TEXT\_TEXT references TEXT\_MAIN which normally expands to only
".text". However, with CONFIG\_LTO\_CLANG, TEXT\_MAIN becomes
".text .text.[0-9a-zA-Z\_]\*" which wrongly matches also the thunk
sections. The output layout is then different than expected. For
instance, the currently defined range [\_\_indirect\_thunk\_start,
\_\_indirect\_thunk\_end] becomes empty.
Prevent the problem by using ".." as the first separator, for example,
".text..\_\_x86.indirect\_thunk". This pattern is utilized by other
explicit section names which start with one of the standard prefixes,
such as ".text" or ".data", and that need to be individually selected in
the linker script.

x86/CPU/AMD: Fix the DIV(0) initial fix attempt
commit f58d6fbcb7c848b7f2469be339bc571f2e9d245b upstream.
Initially, it was thought that doing an innocuous division in the #DE
handler would take care to prevent any leaking of old data from the
divider but by the time the fault is raised, the speculation has already
advanced too far and such data could already have been used by younger
operations.
Therefore, do the innocuous division on every exit to userspace so that
userspace doesn't see any potentially old data from integer divisions in
kernel space.
Do the same before VMRUN too, to protect host data from leaking into the
guest too.

x86/retpoline: Don't clobber RFLAGS during srso\_safe\_ret()
commit ba5ca5e5e6a1d55923e88b4a83da452166f5560e upstream.
Use LEA instead of ADD when adjusting %rsp in srso\_safe\_ret{,\_alias}()
so as to avoid clobbering flags. Drop one of the INT3 instructions to
account for the LEA consuming one more byte than the ADD.
KVM's emulator makes indirect calls into a jump table of sorts, where
the destination of each call is a small blob of code that performs fast
emulation by executing the target instruction with fixed operands.
E.g. to emulate ADC, fastop() invokes adcb\_al\_dl():
adcb\_al\_dl:
<+0>: adc %dl,%al
<+2>: jmp <\_\_x86\_return\_thunk>
A major motivation for doing fast emulation is to leverage the CPU to
handle consumption and manipulation of arithmetic flags, i.e. RFLAGS is
both an input and output to the target of the call. fastop() collects
the RFLAGS result by pushing RFLAGS onto the stack and popping them back
into a variable (held in %rdi in this case):
asm("push %[flags]; popf; " CALL\_NOSPEC " ; pushf; pop %[flags]\n"
<+71>: mov 0xc0(%r8),%rdx
<+78>: mov 0x100(%r8),%rcx
<+85>: push %rdi
<+86>: popf
<+87>: call \*%rsi
<+89>: nop
<+90>: nop
<+91>: nop
<+92>: pushf
<+93>: pop %rdi
and then propagating the arithmetic flags into the vCPU's emulator state:
ctxt->eflags = (ctxt->eflags & ~EFLAGS\_MASK) | (flags & EFLAGS\_MASK);
<+64>: and $0xfffffffffffff72a,%r9
<+94>: and $0x8d5,%edi
<+109>: or %rdi,%r9
<+122>: mov %r9,0x10(%r8)
The failures can be most easily reproduced by running the "emulator"
test in KVM-Unit-Tests.
If you're feeling a bit of deja vu, see commit b63f20a778c8
("x86/retpoline: Don't clobber RFLAGS during CALL\_NOSPEC on i386").
In addition, this breaks booting of clang-compiled guest on
a gcc-compiled host where the host contains the %rsp-modifying SRSO
mitigations.

Turns out that if the very last instruction on the very last page of the
module is a 'JMP \_\_x86\_return\_thunk' then \_\_static\_call\_fixup() will
trip a fault and die.
And while the module rework made this slightly more likely to happen,
it's always been possible.

x86/cpu/kvm: Provide UNTRAIN\_RET\_VM
commit 864bcaa38ee44ec6c0e43f79c2d2997b977e26b2 upstream.
Similar to how it doesn't make sense to have UNTRAIN\_RET have two
untrain calls, it also doesn't make sense for VMEXIT to have an extra
IBPB call.
This cures VMEXIT doing potentially unret+IBPB or double IBPB.
Also, the (SEV) VMEXIT case seems to have been overlooked.
Redefine the meaning of the synthetic IBPB flags to:
- ENTRY\_IBPB -- issue IBPB on entry (was: entry + VMEXIT)
- IBPB\_ON\_VMEXIT -- issue IBPB on VMEXIT
And have 'retbleed=ibpb' set \*BOTH\* feature flags to ensure it retains
the previous behaviour and issues IBPB on entry+VMEXIT.
The new 'srso=ibpb\_vmexit' option only sets IBPB\_ON\_VMEXIT.
Create UNTRAIN\_RET\_VM specifically for the VMEXIT case, and have that
check IBPB\_ON\_VMEXIT.
All this avoids having the VMEXIT case having to check both ENTRY\_IBPB
and IBPB\_ON\_VMEXIT and simplifies the alternatives.

x86/cpu: Clean up SRSO return thunk mess
commit d43490d0ab824023e11d0b57d0aeec17a6e0ca13 upstream.
Use the existing configurable return thunk. There is absolute no
justification for having created this \_\_x86\_return\_thunk alternative.
To clarify, the whole thing looks like:
Zen3/4 does:
srso\_alias\_untrain\_ret:
nop2
lfence
jmp srso\_alias\_return\_thunk
int3
srso\_alias\_safe\_ret: // aliasses srso\_alias\_untrain\_ret just so
add $8, %rsp
ret
int3
srso\_alias\_return\_thunk:
call srso\_alias\_safe\_ret
ud2
While Zen1/2 does:
srso\_untrain\_ret:
movabs $foo, %rax
lfence
call srso\_safe\_ret (jmp srso\_return\_thunk ?)
int3
srso\_safe\_ret: // embedded in movabs instruction
add $8,%rsp
ret
int3
srso\_return\_thunk:
call srso\_safe\_ret
ud2
While retbleed does:
zen\_untrain\_ret:
test $0xcc, %bl
lfence
jmp zen\_return\_thunk
int3
zen\_return\_thunk: // embedded in the test instruction
ret
int3
Where Zen1/2 flush the BTB entry using the instruction decoder trick
(test,movabs) Zen3/4 use BTB aliasing. SRSO adds a return sequence
(srso\_safe\_ret()) which forces the function return instruction to
speculate into a trap (UD2). This RET will then mispredict and
execution will continue at the return site read from the top of the
stack.
Pick one of three options at boot (evey function can only ever return
once).

objtool/x86: Fix SRSO mess
commit 4ae68b26c3ab5a82aa271e6e9fc9b1a06e1d6b40 upstream.
Objtool --rethunk does two things:
- it collects all (tail) call's of \_\_x86\_return\_thunk and places them
into .return\_sites. These are typically compiler generated, but
RET also emits this same.
- it fudges the validation of the \_\_x86\_return\_thunk symbol; because
this symbol is inside another instruction, it can't actually find
the instruction pointed to by the symbol offset and gets upset.
Because these two things pertained to the same symbol, there was no
pressing need to separate these two separate things.
However, alas, along comes SRSO and more crazy things to deal with
appeared.
The SRSO patch itself added the following symbol names to identify as
rethunk:
'srso\_untrain\_ret', 'srso\_safe\_ret' and '\_\_ret'
Where '\_\_ret' is the old retbleed return thunk, 'srso\_safe\_ret' is a
new similarly embedded return thunk, and 'srso\_untrain\_ret' is
completely unrelated to anything the above does (and was only included
because of that INT3 vs UD2 issue fixed previous).
Clear things up by adding a second category for the embedded instruction
thing.

This is because these functions (can) end with CALL, which objtool

INT3 instruction (which is a non-fatal trap) with UD2 (which is a
fatal-trap).
This indicates execution will not continue past this point.

i2c: designware: Handle invalid SMBus block data response length value
commit 69f035c480d76f12bf061148ccfd578e1099e5fc upstream.
In the I2C\_FUNC\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_DATA case, the invalid length byte value
(outside of 1-32) of the SMBus block data response from the Slave device
is not correctly handled by the I2C Designware driver.
In case IC\_EMPTYFIFO\_HOLD\_MASTER\_EN==1, which cannot be detected
from the registers, the Master can be disabled only if the STOP bit
is set. Without STOP bit set, the Master remains active, holding the bus
until receiving a block data response length. This hangs the bus and
is unrecoverable.
Avoid this by issuing another dump read to reach the stop condition when
an invalid length byte is received.

btrfs: only subtract from len\_to\_oe\_boundary when it is tracking an extent
commit 09c3717c3a60e3ef599bc17c70cd3ae2b979ad41 upstream.
bio\_ctrl->len\_to\_oe\_boundary is used to make sure we stay inside a zone
as we submit bios for writes. Every time we add a page to the bio, we
decrement those bytes from len\_to\_oe\_boundary, and then we submit the
bio if we happen to hit zero.
Most of the time, len\_to\_oe\_boundary gets set to U32\_MAX.
submit\_extent\_page() adds pages into our bio, and the size of the bio
ends up limited by:
- Are we contiguous on disk?
- Does bio\_add\_page() allow us to stuff more in?
- is len\_to\_oe\_boundary > 0?
The len\_to\_oe\_boundary math starts with U32\_MAX, which isn't page or
sector aligned, and subtracts from it until it hits zero. In the
non-zoned case, the last IO we submit before we hit zero is going to be
unaligned, triggering BUGs.
This is hard to trigger because bio\_add\_page() isn't going to make a bio
of U32\_MAX size unless you give it a perfect set of pages and fully
contiguous extents on disk. We can hit it pretty reliably while making
large swapfiles during provisioning because the machine is freshly
booted, mostly idle, and the disk is freshly formatted. It's also
possible to trigger with reads when read\_ahead\_kb is set to 4GB.
The code has been clean up and shifted around a few times, but this flaw
has been lurking since the counter was added. I think the commit
24e6c8082208 ("btrfs: simplify main loop in submit\_extent\_page") ended
up exposing the bug.
The fix used here is to skip doing math on len\_to\_oe\_boundary unless
we've changed it from the default U32\_MAX value. bio\_add\_page() is the
real limit we want, and there's no reason to do extra math when block
layer is doing it for us.
Sample reproducer, note you'll need to change the path to the bdi and
device:
SUBVOL=/btrfs/swapvol
SWAPFILE=$SUBVOL/swapfile
SZMB=8192
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/vdb
mount /dev/vdb /btrfs
btrfs subvol create $SUBVOL
chattr +C $SUBVOL

btrfs: fix replace/scrub failure with metadata\_uuid

The failure scenario can be summarized and simplified as follows:
$ mkfs.btrfs -fq -draid1 -mraid1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 :0
$ btrfstune -m /dev/sdb1 :0
$ wipefs -a /dev/sdb1 :0
$ mount -o degraded /dev/sdb2 /btrfs :0

As above, the replace is failing because we are verifying the header with
fs\_devices::fsid instead of fs\_devices::metadata\_uuid, despite the
metadata\_uuid actually being present.
To fix this, use fs\_devices::metadata\_uuid. We copy fsid into
fs\_devices::metadata\_uuid if there is no metadata\_uuid, so its fine.

btrfs: fix incorrect splitting in btrfs\_drop\_extent\_map\_range
commit c962098ca4af146f2625ed64399926a098752c9c upstream.
In production we were seeing a variety of WARN\_ON()'s in the extent\_map
code, specifically in btrfs\_drop\_extent\_map\_range() when we have to call
add\_extent\_mapping() for our second split.
Consider the following extent map layout
PINNED
[0 16K) [32K, 48K)
and then we call btrfs\_drop\_extent\_map\_range for [0, 36K), with
skip\_pinned == true. The initial loop will have
start = 0
end = 36K
len = 36K
we will find the [0, 16k) extent, but since we are pinned we will skip
it, which has this code
start = em\_end;
if (end != (u64)-1)
len = start + len - em\_end;
em\_end here is 16K, so now the values are
start = 16K
len = 16K + 36K - 16K = 36K
len should instead be 20K. This is a problem when we find the next
extent at [32K, 48K), we need to split this extent to leave [36K, 48k),
however the code for the split looks like this
split->start = start + len;
split->len = em\_end - (start + len);
In this case we have
em\_end = 48K
split->start = 16K + 36K // this should be 16K + 20K
split->len = 48K - (16K + 36K) // this overflows as 16K + 36K is 52K
and now we have an invalid extent\_map in the tree that potentially
overlaps other entries in the extent map. Even in the non-overlapping
case we will have split->start set improperly, which will cause problems
with any block related calculations.
We don't actually need len in this loop, we can simply use end as our
end point, and only adjust start up when we find a pinned extent we need
to skip.
Adjust the logic to do this, which keeps us from inserting an invalid
extent map.
We only skip\_pinned in the relocation case, so this is relatively rare,
except in the case where you are running relocation a lot, which can
happen with auto relocation on.

btrfs: fix infinite directory reads
commit 9b378f6ad48cfa195ed868db9123c09ee7ec5ea2 upstream.
The readdir implementation currently processes always up to the last index
it finds. This however can result in an infinite loop if the directory has
a large number of entries such that they won't all fit in the given buffer
passed to the readdir callback, that is, dir\_emit() returns a non-zero
value. Because in that case readdir() will be called again and if in the
meanwhile new directory entries were added and we still can't put all the
remaining entries in the buffer, we keep repeating this over and over.
The following C program and test script reproduce the problem:
$ cat /mnt/readdir\_prog.c
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char \*argv[])
{
DIR \*dir = opendir(".");
struct dirent \*dd;
while ((dd = readdir(dir))) {
printf("%s\n", dd->d\_name);
rename(dd->d\_name, "TEMPFILE");
rename("TEMPFILE", dd->d\_name);
}
closedir(dir);
}
$ gcc -o /mnt/readdir\_prog /mnt/readdir\_prog.c
$ cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
DEV=/dev/sdi
MNT=/mnt/sdi
mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV &> /dev/null
#mkfs.xfs -f $DEV &> /dev/null
#mkfs.ext4 -F $DEV &> /dev/null
mount $DEV $MNT
mkdir $MNT/testdir
for ((i = 1; i <= 2000; i++)); do
echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file\_$i
done
cd $MNT/testdir
/mnt/readdir\_prog
cd /mnt
umount $MNT
This behaviour is surprising to applications and it's unlike ext4, xfs,
tmpfs, vfat and other filesystems, which always finish. In this case where
new entries were added due to renames, some file names may be reported
more than once, but this varies according to each filesystem - for example
ext4 never reported the same file more than once while xfs reports the
first 13 file names twice.
So change our readdir implementation to track the last index number when
opendir() is called and then make readdir() never process beyond that
index number. This gives the same behaviour as ext4.

smb3: display network namespace in debug information
commit 7b38f6ddc97bf572c3422d3175e8678dd95502fa upstream.
We recently had problems where a network namespace was deleted
causing hard to debug reconnect problems. To help deal with
configuration issues like this it is useful to dump the network
namespace to better debug what happened.
So add this to information displayed in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData for
the server (and channels if mounted with multichannel). For example:
Local Users To Server: 1 SecMode: 0x1 Req On Wire: 0 Net namespace: 4026531840
This can be easily compared with what is displayed for the
processes on the system. For example /proc/1/ns/net in this case
showed the same thing (see below), and we can see that the namespace
is still valid in this example.

vdpa: Add max vqp attr to vdpa\_nl\_policy for nlattr length check
commit 5d6ba607d6cb5c58a4ddf33381e18c83dbb4098f upstream.
The vdpa\_nl\_policy structure is used to validate the nlattr when parsing
the incoming nlmsg. It will ensure the attribute being described produces
a valid nlattr pointer in info->attrs before entering into each handler
in vdpa\_nl\_ops.
That is to say, the missing part in vdpa\_nl\_policy may lead to illegal
nlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.
This patch adds the missing nla\_policy for vdpa max vqp attr to avoid
such bugs.

media: mtk-jpeg: Set platform driver data earlier
commit 8329d0c7355bfb7237baf09ec979c3e8144d2781 upstream.
In the multi-core JPEG encoder/decoder setup, the driver for the
individual cores references the parent device's platform driver data.
However, in the parent driver, this is only set at the end of the probe
function, way later than devm\_of\_platform\_populate(), which triggers
the probe of the cores. This causes a kernel splat in the sub-device
probe function.
Move platform\_set\_drvdata() to before devm\_of\_platform\_populate() to
fix this.

i2c: tegra: Fix i2c-tegra DMA config option processing
commit 27ec43c77b5db780a56fc3a6d6de6bf2f74614f7 upstream.
Tegra processors prior to Tegra186 used APB DMA for I2C requiring
CONFIG\_TEGRA20\_APB\_DMA=y while Tegra186 and later use GPC DMA requiring
CONFIG\_TEGRA186\_GPC\_DMA=y.
The check for if the processor uses APB DMA is inverted and so the wrong
DMA config options are checked.
This means if CONFIG\_TEGRA20\_APB\_DMA=y but CONFIG\_TEGRA186\_GPC\_DMA=n
with a Tegra186 or later processor the driver will incorrectly think DMA is
enabled and attempt to request DMA channels that will never be availible,
leaving the driver in a perpetual EPROBE\_DEFER state.

The mr->initialized flag is shared between the control vq and data vq
part of the mr init/uninit. But if the control vq and data vq get placed
in different ASIDs, it can happen that initializing the control vq will
prevent the data vq mr from being initialized.
This patch consolidates the control and data vq init parts into their
own init functions. The mr->initialized will now be used for the data vq
only. The control vq currently doesn't need a flag.
The uninitializing part is also taken care of: mlx5\_vdpa\_destroy\_mr got
split into data and control vq functions which are now also ASID aware.

virtio-mmio: don't break lifecycle of vm\_dev
[ Upstream commit 55c91fedd03d7b9cf0c5199b2eb12b9b8e95281a ]
vm\_dev has a separate lifecycle because it has a 'struct device'
embedded. Thus, having a release callback for it is correct.
Allocating the vm\_dev struct with devres totally breaks this protection,
though. Instead of waiting for the vm\_dev release callback, the memory
is freed when the platform\_device is removed. Resulting in a
use-after-free when finally the callback is to be called.
To easily see the problem, compile the kernel with
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_KOBJECT\_RELEASE and unbind with sysfs.
The fix is easy, don't use devres in this case.
Found during my research about object lifetime problems.

btrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused
[ Upstream commit 0657b20c5a76c938612f8409735a8830d257866e ]
If a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused
before we finish its creation, at btrfs\_create\_pending\_block\_groups(),
then when btrfs\_mark\_bg\_unused() is called against the block group, we
assume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to
reclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the
list of unused block groups. This has two consequences:
1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the
current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and
if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find
the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),
its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the
deletion to fail due to the missing items;
2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we
move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the
block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that
case it already has the correct reference count. However the block
group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra
reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This
later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when
removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the
reference count to 0.
This second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which
produced the following assertion failure and stack trace:

Fix this by adding a runtime flag to the block group to tell that the
block group is still in the list of new block groups, and therefore it
should not be moved to the list of unused block groups, at
btrfs\_mark\_bg\_unused(), until the flag is cleared, when we finish the
creation of the block group at btrfs\_create\_pending\_block\_groups().

btrfs: move out now unused BG from the reclaim list
[ Upstream commit a9f189716cf15913c453299d72f69c51a9b0f86b ]
An unused block group is easy to remove to free up space and should be
reclaimed fast. Such block group can often already be a target of the
reclaim process. As we check list\_empty(&bg->bg\_list), we keep it in the
reclaim list. That block group is never reclaimed until the file system
is filled e.g. up to 75%.
Instead, we can move unused block group to the unused list and delete it
fast.

ring-buffer: Do not swap cpu\_buffer during resize process
[ Upstream commit 8a96c0288d0737ad77882024974c075345c72011 ]
When ring\_buffer\_swap\_cpu was called during resize process,
the cpu buffer was swapped in the middle, resulting in incorrect state.
Continuing to run in the wrong state will result in oops.
This issue can be easily reproduced using the following two scripts:
/tmp # cat test1.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
echo 2000 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer\_size\_kb
sleep 0.5
echo 5000 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer\_size\_kb
sleep 0.5
done
/tmp # cat test2.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
echo irqsoff > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
sleep 1
echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
sleep 1
done
/tmp # ./test1.sh &
/tmp # ./test2.sh &
A typical oops log is as follows, sometimes with other different oops logs.

[ Upstream commit ccb381e1af1ace292153c88eb1fffa5683d16a20 ]
As per the generic KASAN code in mm/kasan, disable KCOV with
KCOV\_INSTRUMENT := n in the makefile.
This fixes a ppc64 boot hang when KCOV and KASAN are enabled.
kasan\_early\_init() gets called before a PACA is initialised, but the
KCOV hook expects a valid PACA.

ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd\_hdac\_regmap\_sync()
[ Upstream commit 1f4a08fed450db87fbb5ff5105354158bdbe1a22 ]
The variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock
codec->regmap\_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without
holding the lock when is accessed in snd\_hdac\_regmap\_sync():
if (codec->regmap)
In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is
set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
dereference can occur in the called function regcache\_sync():
map->lock(map->lock\_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c
To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
mutex\_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
function call to regcache\_sync().
[ Note: the lack of the regmap\_lock itself is harmless for the current
codec driver implementations, as snd\_hdac\_regmap\_sync() is only for
PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.
But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged
as is -- tiwai ]

the amplifiers. They can be added during boot to get working sound out

fs: ntfs3: Fix possible null-pointer dereferences in mi\_read()
[ Upstream commit 97498cd610c0d030a7bd49a7efad974790661162 ]
In a previous commit 2681631c2973 ("fs/ntfs3: Add null pointer check to
attr\_load\_runs\_vcn"), ni can be NULL in attr\_load\_runs\_vcn(), and thus it
should be checked before being used.
However, in the call stack of this commit, mft\_ni in mi\_read() is
aliased with ni in attr\_load\_runs\_vcn(), and it is also used in
mi\_read() at two places:
mi\_read()
rw\_lock = &mft\_ni->file.run\_lock -> No check
attr\_load\_runs\_vcn(mft\_ni, ...)
ni (namely mft\_ni) is checked in the previous commit
attr\_load\_runs\_vcn(..., &mft\_ni->file.run) -> No check
Thus, to avoid possible null-pointer dereferences, the related checks
should be added.
These bugs are reported by a static analysis tool implemented by myself,
and they are found by extending a known bug fixed in the previous commit.
Thus, they could be theoretical bugs.

ntfs\_read\_ea is called when we want to read extended attributes. There
are some sanity checks for the validity of the EAs. However, it fails to
return a proper error code for the inconsistent attributes, which might
lead to unpredicted memory accesses after return.

Intel Barlow Ridge is the first USB4 v2 controller from Intel. The
controller exposes standard USB4 PCI class ID in typical configurations,
however there is a way to configure it so that it uses a special class
ID to allow using s different driver than the Windows inbox one. For
this reason add the Barlow Ridge PCI ID to the Linux driver too so that
the driver can attach regardless of the class ID.

gfs2: Fix possible data races in gfs2\_show\_options()
[ Upstream commit 6fa0a72cbbe45db4ed967a51f9e6f4e3afe61d20 ]
Some fields such as gt\_logd\_secs of the struct gfs2\_tune are accessed
without holding the lock gt\_spin in gfs2\_show\_options():
val = sdp->sd\_tune.gt\_logd\_secs;
if (val != 30)
seq\_printf(s, ",commit=%d", val);
And thus can cause data races when gfs2\_show\_options() and other functions
such as gfs2\_reconfigure() are concurrently executed:
spin\_lock(&gt->gt\_spin);
gt->gt\_logd\_secs = newargs->ar\_commit;
To fix these possible data races, the lock sdp->sd\_tune.gt\_spin is
acquired before accessing the fields of gfs2\_tune and released after these
accesses.
Further changes by Andreas:
- Don't hold the spin lock over the seq\_printf operations.

usb: chipidea: imx: turn off vbus comparator when suspend
[ Upstream commit 0ac37fbdad7087bbcbbe246a602c248ccfd954ea ]
As we use bvalid for vbus wakeup source, to save power when
suspend, turn off the vbus comparator for imx7d and imx8mm.
Below is this bit description from RM of iMX8MM
"VBUS Valid Comparator Enable:
This signal controls the USB OTG PHY VBUS Valid comparator which
indicates whether the voltage on the USB\_OTG\*\_VBUS pin is below
the VBUS Valid threshold. The VBUS Valid threshold is nominally
4.75V on this USB PHY. The VBUS Valid threshold can be adjusted
using the USBNC\_OTGn\_PHY\_CFG1[OTGTUNE0] bit field. Status of the
VBUS Valid comparator, when it is enabled, is reported on the
USBNC\_OTGn\_PHY\_STATUS[VBUS\_VLD] bit.
When OTGDISABLE0 (USBNC\_USB\_OTGx\_PHY\_CFG2[10])is set to 1'b0 and
DRVVBUS0 is set to 1'b1, the Bandgap circuitry and VBUS Valid
comparator are powered, even in Suspend or Sleep mode.
DRVVBUS0 should be reset to 1'b0 when the internal VBUS Valid comparator
is not required, to reduce quiescent current in Suspend or Sleep mode.
- 0 The VBUS Valid comparator is disabled
- 1 The VBUS Valid comparator is enabled"

usb: gadget: uvc: queue empty isoc requests if no video buffer is available
[ Upstream commit c3ff12a92bd7072170978b8b41c2fa41b038139a ]
ISOC transfers expect a certain cadence of requests being queued. Not
keeping up with the expected rate of requests results in missed ISOC
transfers (EXDEV). The application layer may or may not produce video
frames to match this expectation, so uvc gadget driver must handle cases
where the application is not queuing up buffers fast enough to fulfill
ISOC requirements.
Currently, uvc gadget driver waits for new video buffer to become available
before queuing up usb requests. With this patch the gadget driver queues up
0 length usb requests whenever there are no video buffers available. The
USB controller's complete callback is used as the limiter for how quickly
the 0 length packets will be queued. Video buffers are still queued as
soon as they become available.

usb: gadget: u\_serial: Avoid spinlock recursion in \_\_gs\_console\_push
[ Upstream commit e5990469943c711cb00bfde6338d2add6c6d0bfe ]
When serial console over USB is enabled, gs\_console\_connect
queues gs\_console\_work, where it acquires the spinlock and
queues the usb request, and this request goes to gadget layer.
Now consider a situation where gadget layer prints something
to dmesg, this will eventually call gs\_console\_write() which
requires cons->lock. And this causes spinlock recursion. Avoid
this by excluding usb\_ep\_queue from the spinlock.

media: camss: set VFE bpl\_alignment to 16 for sdm845 and sm8250
[ Upstream commit d5b7eb477c286f6ceccbb38704136eea0e6b09ca ]
From the experiments with camera sensors using SGRBG10\_1X10/3280x2464 and
SRGGB10\_1X10/3280x2464 formats, it becomes clear that on sdm845 and sm8250
VFE outputs the lines padded to a length multiple of 16 bytes. As in the
current driver the value of the bpl\_alignment is set to 8 bytes, the frames
captured in formats with the bytes-per-line value being not a multiple of
16 get corrupted.
Set the bpl\_alignment of the camss video output device to 16 for sdm845 and
sm8250 to fix that.

serial: stm32: Ignore return value of uart\_remove\_one\_port() in .remove()
[ Upstream commit 6bd6cd29c92401a101993290051fa55078238a52 ]
Returning early from stm32\_usart\_serial\_remove() results in a resource
leak as several cleanup functions are not called. The driver core ignores
the return value and there is no possibility to clean up later.
uart\_remove\_one\_port() only returns non-zero if there is some
inconsistency (i.e. stm32\_usart\_driver.state[port->line].uart\_port == NULL).
This should never happen, and even if it does it's a bad idea to exit
early in the remove callback without cleaning up.
This prepares changing the prototype of struct platform\_driver::remove to
return void. See commit 5c5a7680e67b ("platform: Provide a remove callback
that returns no value") for further details about this quest.

Revert "[PATCH] uml: export symbols added by GCC hardened"
[ Upstream commit 8635e8df477bc77837886da206f4915576f88fec ]
This reverts commit cead61a6717a9873426b08d73a34a325e3546f5d.
It exported \_\_stack\_smash\_handler and \_\_guard, while they may not be
defined by anyone.
The code \*declares\* \_\_stack\_smash\_handler and \_\_guard. It does not
create weak symbols. If no external library is linked, they are left
undefined, but yet exported.
If a loadable module tries to access non-existing symbols, bad things
(a page fault, NULL pointer dereference, etc.) will happen. So, the
current code is wrong and dangerous.
If the code were written as follows, it would \*define\* them as weak
symbols so modules would be able to get access to them.
void (\*\_\_stack\_smash\_handler)(void \*) \_\_attribute\_\_((weak));
EXPORT\_SYMBOL(\_\_stack\_smash\_handler);
long \_\_guard \_\_attribute\_\_((weak));
EXPORT\_SYMBOL(\_\_guard);
In fact, modpost forbids exporting undefined symbols. It shows an error
message if it detects such a mistake.
ERROR: modpost: "..." [...] was exported without definition
Unfortunately, it is checked only when the code is built as modular.
The problem described above has been unnoticed for a long time because
arch/um/os-Linux/user\_syms.c is always built-in.
With a planned change in Kbuild, exporting undefined symbols will always
result in a build error instead of a run-time error. It is a good thing,
but we need to fix the breakage in advance.
One fix is to define weak symbols as shown above. An alternative is to
export them conditionally as follows:
#ifdef CONFIG\_STACKPROTECTOR
extern void \_\_stack\_smash\_handler(void \*);
EXPORT\_SYMBOL(\_\_stack\_smash\_handler);
external long \_\_guard;
EXPORT\_SYMBOL(\_\_guard);
#endif
This is what other architectures do; EXPORT\_SYMBOL(\_\_stack\_chk\_guard)
is guarded by #ifdef CONFIG\_STACKPROTECTOR.
However, adding the #ifdef guard is not sensible because UML cannot
enable the stack-protector in the first place! (Please note UML does
not select HAVE\_STACKPROTECTOR in Kconfig.)
So, the code is already broken (and unused) in multiple ways.
Just remove.

ASoC: SOF: core: Free the firmware trace before calling snd\_sof\_shutdown()
[ Upstream commit d389dcb3a48cec4f03c16434c0bf98a4c635372a ]
The shutdown is called on reboot/shutdown of the machine.
At this point the firmware tracing cannot be used anymore but in case of
IPC3 it is using and keeping a DMA channel active (dtrace).
For Tiger Lake platforms we have a quirk in place to fix rare reboot issues
when a DMA was active before rebooting the system.
If the tracing is enabled this quirk will be always used and a print
appears on the kernel log which might be misleading or not even correct.
Release the fw tracing before executing the shutdown to make sure that this
known DMA user is cleared away.

drm/amd/display: Skip DPP DTO update if root clock is gated
[ Upstream commit 30f90f3c1c2c63c2fa44f61233737d27b72637c2 ]
[Why]
Hardware implements root clock gating by utilizing the DPP DTO registers
with a special case of DTO enabled, phase = 0, modulo = 1. This
conflicts with our policy to always update the DPPDTO for cases where
it's expected to be disabled.
The pipes unexpectedly enter a higher power state than expected because
of this programming flow.
[How]
Guard the upper layers of HWSS against this hardware quirk with
programming the register with an internal state flag in DCCG.
While technically acting as global state for the DCCG, HWSS shouldn't be
expected to understand the hardware quirk for having DTO disabled
causing more power than DTO enabled with this specific setting.
This also prevents sequencing errors from occuring in the future if
we have to program DPP DTO in multiple locations.

RDMA/mlx5: Return the firmware result upon destroying QP/RQ
[ Upstream commit 22664c06e997087fe37f9ba208008c948571214a ]
Previously when destroying a QP/RQ, the result of the firmware
destruction function was ignored and upper layers weren't informed
about the failure.
Which in turn could lead to various problems since when upper layer
isn't aware of the failure it continues its operation thinking that the
related QP/RQ was successfully destroyed while it actually wasn't,
which could lead to the below kernel WARN.
Currently, we return the correct firmware destruction status to upper
layers which in case of the RQ would be mlx5\_ib\_destroy\_wq() which
was already capable of handling RQ destruction failure or in case of
a QP to destroy\_qp\_common(), which now would actually warn upon qp
destruction failure.

iommu/amd: Introduce Disable IRTE Caching Support
[ Upstream commit 66419036f68a838c00cbccacd6cb2e99da6e5710 ]
An Interrupt Remapping Table (IRT) stores interrupt remapping configuration
for each device. In a normal operation, the AMD IOMMU caches the table
to optimize subsequent data accesses. This requires the IOMMU driver to
invalidate IRT whenever it updates the table. The invalidation process
includes issuing an INVALIDATE\_INTERRUPT\_TABLE command following by
a COMPLETION\_WAIT command.
However, there are cases in which the IRT is updated at a high rate.
For example, for IOMMU AVIC, the IRTE[IsRun] bit is updated on every
vcpu scheduling (i.e. amd\_iommu\_update\_ga()). On system with large
amount of vcpus and VFIO PCI pass-through devices, the invalidation
process could potentially become a performance bottleneck.
Introducing a new kernel boot option:
amd\_iommu=irtcachedis
which disables IRTE caching by setting the IRTCachedis bit in each IOMMU
Control register, and bypass the IRT invalidation process.

HID: i2c-hid: goodix: Add support for "goodix,no-reset-during-suspend" property
[ Upstream commit 7607f12ba735f04e0ef8718dabadf3a765c9a477 ]
In the beginning, commit 18eeef46d359 ("HID: i2c-hid: goodix: Tie the
reset line to true state of the regulator") introduced a change to tie
the reset line of the Goodix touchscreen to the state of the regulator
to fix a power leakage issue in suspend.
After some time, the change was deemed unnecessary and was reverted in
commit 557e05fa9fdd ("HID: i2c-hid: goodix: Stop tying the reset line to
the regulator") due to difficulties in managing regulator notifiers for
designs like Evoker, which provides a second power rail to touchscreen.
However, the revert caused a power regression on another Chromebook
device Steelix in the field, which has a dedicated always-on regulator
for touchscreen and was covered by the workaround in the first commit.
To address both cases, this patch adds the support for the new
"goodix,no-reset-during-suspend" property in the driver:
- When set to true, the driver does not assert the reset GPIO during
power-down.
Instead, the GPIO will be asserted during power-up to ensure the
touchscreen always has a clean start and consistent behavior after
resuming.
This is for designs with a dedicated always-on regulator.
- When set to false or unset, the driver uses the original control flow
and asserts GPIO and disables regulators normally.
This is for the two-regulator and shared-regulator designs.

[ Upstream commit 359ed24a0dd3802e703ec8071dc3b6ed446de5f0 ]
We observed that on Chromebook device Steelix, if Goodix GT7375P
touchscreen is powered in suspend (because, for example, it connects to
an always-on regulator) and with the reset GPIO asserted, it will
introduce about 14mW power leakage.
To address that, we add this property to skip reset during suspend.
If it's set, the driver will stop asserting the reset GPIO during
power-down. Refer to the comments in the driver for details.

b) Conversely when only Display Audio codecs can be found, we do want
to start the SoundWire links, if any. That will help add the relevant
topologies and machine descriptors, and identify cases where the
SoundWire information in ACPI needs to be modified with a quirk.

iopoll: Call cpu\_relax() in busy loops
[ Upstream commit b407460ee99033503993ac7437d593451fcdfe44 ]
It is considered good practice to call cpu\_relax() in busy loops, see
Documentation/process/volatile-considered-harmful.rst. This can not
only lower CPU power consumption or yield to a hyperthreaded twin
processor, but also allows an architecture to mitigate hardware issues
(e.g. ARM Erratum 754327 for Cortex-A9 prior to r2p0) in the
architecture-specific cpu\_relax() implementation.
In addition, cpu\_relax() is also a compiler barrier. It is not
immediately obvious that the @op argument "function" will result in an
actual function call (e.g. in case of inlining).
Where a function call is a C sequence point, this is lost on inlining.
Therefore, with agressive enough optimization it might be possible for
the compiler to hoist the:
(val) = op(args);
"load" out of the loop because it doesn't see the value changing. The
addition of cpu\_relax() would inhibit this.
As the iopoll helpers lack calls to cpu\_relax(), people are sometimes
reluctant to use them, and may fall back to open-coded polling loops
(including cpu\_relax() calls) instead.
Fix this by adding calls to cpu\_relax() to the iopoll helpers:
- For the non-atomic case, it is sufficient to call cpu\_relax() in
case of a zero sleep-between-reads value, as a call to
usleep\_range() is a safe barrier otherwise. However, it doesn't
hurt to add the call regardless, for simplicity, and for similarity
with the atomic case below.
- For the atomic case, cpu\_relax() must be called regardless of the
sleep-between-reads value, as there is no guarantee all
architecture-specific implementations of udelay() handle this.

Revert "drm/amd/display: disable SubVP + DRR to prevent underflow"
[ Upstream commit f38129bb081758176dd78304faaee95007fb8838 ]
This reverts commit 80c6d6804f31451848a3956a70c2bcb1f07cfcb0.
The orignal commit was intended as a workaround to prevent underflow and
flickering when using one normal monitor and the other high refresh rate
monitor (> 120Hz).
This patch is being reverted in favour of a software solution to enable
SubVP+DRR

For smu v13\_0\_2, if the GPU supports xgmi, refer to

it will run gpu recover in AMDGPU\_RESET\_FOR\_DEVICE\_REMOVE mode when removing,
which makes all devices in hive list have hw reset but no resume except the
basic ip blocks, then other ip blocks will not call .hw\_fini according to
ip\_block.status.hw.
Since psp\_free\_shared\_bufs just includes some software operations, so move
it to psp\_sw\_fini.

drm/scheduler: set entity to NULL in drm\_sched\_entity\_pop\_job()
[ Upstream commit 96c7c2f4d5bd94b15fe63448c087f01607b56f4a ]
It already happend a few times that patches slipped through which
implemented access to an entity through a job that was already removed
from the entities queue. Since jobs and entities might have different
lifecycles, this can potentially cause UAF bugs.
In order to make it obvious that a jobs entity pointer shouldn't be
accessed after drm\_sched\_entity\_pop\_job() was called successfully, set
the jobs entity pointer to NULL once the job is removed from the entity
queue.
Moreover, debugging a potential NULL pointer dereference is way easier
than potentially corrupted memory through a UAF.

- This is required because DTO programming

net: phy: at803x: fix the wol setting functions
[ Upstream commit e58f30246c35c126c7571065b33bee4b3b1d2ef8 ]
In commit 7beecaf7d507 ("net: phy: at803x: improve the WOL feature"), it
seems not correct to use a wol\_en bit in a 1588 Control Register which is
only available on AR8031/AR8033(share the same phy\_id) to determine if WoL
is enabled. Change it back to use AT803X\_INTR\_ENABLE\_WOL for determining
the WoL status which is applicable on all chips supporting wol. Also update
the at803x\_set\_wol() function to only update the 1588 register on chips
having it. After this change, disabling wol at probe from commit
d7cd5e06c9dd ("net: phy: at803x: disable WOL at probe") is no longer
needed. Change it to just disable the WoL bit in 1588 register for
AR8031/AR8033 to be aligned with AT803X\_INTR\_ENABLE\_WOL in probe.
