- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can perform arbitrary actions on the affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to persuade a user of the ISE web interface to follow a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and convince a user to click it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system.
