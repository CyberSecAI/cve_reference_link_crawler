Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the webserver of the affected devices. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of GET requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The webserver fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in GET requests, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Device Control:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full control over the affected devices.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any command they desire on the underlying operating system.
- **Data Manipulation:** The provided PoC shows the attacker can change the root password.
- **System Compromise:** By changing the password the device is effectively compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to the webserver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated on the web interface to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the web interface of the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products:**
- Helmholz Industrial Router REX100 (<= 2.2.11)
- MBConnectline mbNET.mini (<= 2.2.11)

**Proof of Concept:**
A sample GET request is provided demonstrating the vulnerability:

```
GET /cgi-bin/ping;echo$IFS'root:password'|chpasswd;ps;.sh HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.25.11
Authorization: Basic aGVsbWhvbHo6cm91dGVy
...
```

This request injects commands to change the root password and list processes.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to the latest firmware version (2.2.13)

**Mitigation:**
- Restrict network access to the management interface of the device.
- Ensure no malicious actors can login to the vulnerable devices.
