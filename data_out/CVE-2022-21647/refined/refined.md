Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `old()` function in CodeIgniter4 deserializes untrusted data. Specifically, if the value retrieved from the old input is a serialized string, it's automatically unserialized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `old()` function automatically unserializes data without proper validation, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code due to object injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution (RCE):** An attacker can inject malicious serialized PHP objects, which, upon unserialization, can lead to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **SQL Injection:** A working exploit is mentioned that can lead to SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network based.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through user-controlled input that is then processed by the `old()` function. This could be through form submissions that are then redirected to another page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No Privileges required**: An attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability
- **No User Interaction required**:  The attacker doesn't require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request with a serialized payload to the server, such as through a form submission.
