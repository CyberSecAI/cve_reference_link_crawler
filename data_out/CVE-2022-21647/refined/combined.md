# Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Codeigniter4

High

[MGatner](/MGatner)
published
GHSA-w6jr-wj64-mc9x
Jan 3, 2022

## Package

composer

codeigniter4/framework
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.6

## Patched versions

4.1.6

## Description

### Impact

Deserialization of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4.

Remote attackers may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability,

and possibly execute existing PHP code on the server.

We are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to SQL injection.

### Patches

Upgrade to v4.1.6 or later.

### Workarounds

Do not use:

* `old()` and form\_helper
* `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`

### References

* [PHP Object Injection | OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
