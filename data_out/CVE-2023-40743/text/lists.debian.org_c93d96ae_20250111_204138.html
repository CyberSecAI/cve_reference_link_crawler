Package        : axis
Version        : 1.4-28+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-40743
Debian Bug     : 1051288

Letian Yuan discovered a flaw in Apache Axis 1.x, a SOAP implementation written
in Java. It may not have been obvious that looking up a service through
"ServiceFactory.getService" allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such
as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the
application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to remote code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.4-28+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your axis packages.
