# USB Audio 2.0 Class Driver for Windows 10 and Windows 11

Thesycon’s USB audio class driver TUSBAudio targets USB audio devices for professional and semi-professional use and highest quality audiophile HiFi systems. The driver supports devices which are compliant to the USB Audio 2.0 or USB Audio 1.0 device class specification. The driver provides an ASIO 2.3.1 compliant software interface and integrates with Windows as a standard WDM/DirectX compatible sound device. If the device provides MIDI features the driver exposes standard Windows MIDI ports.

To meet professional audio requirements, the audio class driver is optimized for low latency and low CPU load. Buffer depths can be adjusted by the user to optimize settings for a given computer. The driver implements a transparent (bit-perfect) playback and recording data path.

* DSD sample rates: DSD64 (2.8MHz), DSD128 (5.6MHz), DSD256 (11.3MHz), DSD512 (22.6MHz), DSD1024 (45.2MHz)
### MIDI Features

* Windows compliant MIDI input and output ports (depending on device capabilities)
* Multiple applications can share a MIDI input port.
* Optionally, multiple applications can share a MIDI output port.

## Customization of the Driver

* The driver will be delivered fully customized for licensee’s product.
* Customization includes USB VID/PID, file names, text strings, etc.
* The driver is signed by using Microsoft Attestation signing.
* Driver Customization Kit add-on: The Driver Customization Kit enables licensee to customize the driver by themselves.
## Driver Installer

* Wizard style user interface for interactive use
* Command line interface (silent mode) for integration into overall software setup
* Customization possible
## Control Panel

* Control panel application with graphical user interface is included
* Device status and control via private programming interface (DLL)
* Source code of the control panel is part of the [SDK](../eng/usb_audiodriver.shtml#SDK).
## Firmware Upgrade

* DFU utility with graphical user interface is included
* Firmware upgrade according to DFU device class
* Customization and Multi-language user interface is possible
* Source code of the DFU utility is part of the [SDK](../eng/usb_audiodriver.shtml#SDK).

NOTE: A DFU utility with identical functionality is available for [macOS](../eng/usb_dfu.shtml) as well.

## Software Development Kit – SDK

The SDK add-on is an optional component. It enables custom control panel development and direct access to custom firmware features. The SDK includes:

* API definition and link library for TUSBAudio API DLL
* API reference documentation
* Source Code of sample control panel implementation
* Source Code of DFU Application
## Mixer Add-on

The Mixer Add-on is an optional component of the TUSBAudio driver and has to be licensed additionally. The Mixer plugin enables the following features:

* Driver implements complete mixer matrix for all input and output channels
* Any mixer weight can be controlled through API at runtime
* Virtual input or output channels can be defined (e.g. loopback channels)
* Virtual WDM sound devices can be built from virtual channels
* [SDK](../eng/usb_audiodriver.shtml#MixerSDK) available, contains sample application for mixer control
## Mixer Software Development Kit – Mixer SDK

The Mixer SDK is an optional component and requires the Mixer add-on. It includes:

* API definition and link library for TUSBAudio API DLL
* Source Code of sample control panel implementation
* Source Code of DFU Application
* Sample application for mixer control
* Any mixer weight can be controlled through API at runtime
* TUSBAudio Reference Manual
## Supported Platforms

* Windows 11 arm64
* Windows 11 64-bit
* Windows 10 64-bit
* Windows 10 32-bit
## Device and Firmware Requirements

The USB Audio 2.0 Class Driver for Windows implements the USB Audio 2.0 and 1.0 device class specification and is independent of the specific silicon and firmware solution used in a given device. As long as the hardware and firmware implement the descriptors, endpoints and requests defined in the class specification the driver should work. However, there are some requirements and assumptions as listed below.

* A device can implement a playback data path, a recording data path, or both.
* Both playback and recording path must be driven by the same sample clock source (as required by ASIO).
* An Audio 2.0 device must implement at least one clock source unit. If there is more than one clock source then a clock selector unit must be implemented as well.
* The driver supports the asynchronous, synchronous and adaptive endpoint synchronization model.
* If there is a recording path (IN endpoint) then the driver uses the incoming sample stream as clock reference to generate the outgoing stream (playback path).
* A playback-only device with an asynchronous OUT endpoint must implement a feedback endpoint.
* Optionally, a device can implement a feature unit to expose volume and mute controls.

The free evaluation version of the TUSBAudio driver works for an interval of 60 days without any limitation. After that evaluation period has expired, the driver stops working.

NOTE: The driver described on this page is \*not for use by end users\*. It will not help solve any problems you may experience with a consumer device such as a webcam, camcorder, card reader, external sound card, etc. Thesycon’s device drivers are software components intended to be used by hardware or software manufacturers to create end products.

Current Version: 5.72

## Security Advisory (CVE-2024-25376)

An Insecure Permission vulnerability in the MSI-based driver installer has been reported by Julian Horoszkiewicz from the Eviden Red Team. The MSI installer before v5.68 allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via the msiexec.exe repair mode. A local user can trigger msiexec in repair mode (/fa flag) on the MSI package present in C:\Windows\Installer. In result, a copy of tlsetupfx.exe executable is executed with SYSTEM privileges, from the local %TEMP% directory, creating a race condition giving the regular user an opportunity to switch executable files (e.g. DLLs) and get their own code executed as SYSTEM.

All TUSBAudio driver installers after v5.40.0 and before v5.68.0 are affected.

For more information about this vulnerability, see also CVE-2024-25376.

Thesycon has fixed the vulnerability in v5.68.0 and provides updates for all affected driver packages. Thesycon strongly encourages customers to update any released driver packages.
