The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48227.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a logical flaw in the deletion function of the Curd One Click Command in funadmin. Specifically, the `delete` method in `funadmin\app\curd\controller\Table.php` directly concatenates the provided ID into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows for SQL injection. Although a blacklist is implemented to prevent deletion of certain tables, this can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The direct concatenation of the ID into the SQL query enables SQL injection.
- Inadequate input validation: Although a blacklist exists for table names, it can be bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary table deletion: An attacker can delete any table in the database, including crucial tables such as `fun_member` (leading to front-end crashes) or `fun_admin` (leading to back-end crashes).
- Application disruption: Deletion of critical tables causes crashes and malfunctions in both the front-end and back-end interfaces.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploited using a crafted GET request to the `/curd/table/delete` endpoint, with the `id` parameter containing the name of the table to delete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Backend administrator privileges are required to access the vulnerable endpoint and perform the deletion.
