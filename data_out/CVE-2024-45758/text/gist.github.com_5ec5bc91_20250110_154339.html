|  | ## CVE-2024-45758: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via Unrestricted JDBC Connection |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### Description |
|  | H2O.ai H2O version 3.46.0.4 contains a vulnerability that allows attackers to arbitrarily set the JDBC URL, leading to deserialization attacks, file reads, and command execution. Exploitation occurs when an attacker has access to post to the ImportSQLTable URI with a JSON document containing a connection\_url property with any typical JDBC Connection URL attack payload, such as one that uses queryInterceptors. |
|  |  |
|  | Despite the use of the `getConnectionSafe` method by H2O, which appears to be intended to establish a secure connection, no restrictions are placed on the JDBC connection settings. This allows attackers to set the JDBC URL arbitrarily, leading to potential deserialization attacks, file reads, command execution, and other risks on the victim's server. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vulnerability Type |
|  | - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via Unrestricted JDBC Connection |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Product Code Base |
|  | - H2O.ai H2O-3 <= 3.46.0.4 (latest) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Component |
|  | - H2O-3 |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Type |
|  | - Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ### Impact |
|  | - Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Vectors |
|  | - Network |
