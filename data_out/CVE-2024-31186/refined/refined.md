- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `fluid_msg::of13::QueueGetConfigReply::unpack` function within the libfluid library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the code attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the target component. The CVSS score also indicates a low impact to confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a network attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the network with the ability to send crafted packets to the vulnerable component. No prior privileges are needed.
