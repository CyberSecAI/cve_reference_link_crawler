The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10043.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided file paths in the `delete.php`, `download.php`, and `view_file.php` scripts. Specifically, the scripts were vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to not checking for `..` sequences within the provided file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The scripts failed to validate user input, specifically the `file` parameter, before using it to construct file paths. Attackers could potentially use `..` sequences in the `file` parameter to navigate outside the intended directory and access or delete arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: Attackers could read the content of arbitrary files on the server.
- Arbitrary File Deletion: Attackers could delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `file` GET parameter in `delete.php`, `download.php`, and `view_file.php` was the attack vector.
- By manipulating the `file` parameter to include path traversal sequences such as `../`, an attacker could navigate to unintended locations on the filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts (`delete.php`, `download.php`, `view_file.php`) with a modified `file` parameter. They would need to know that these files exist on the web server and how the file parameter is used in the script to access the filesystem.
