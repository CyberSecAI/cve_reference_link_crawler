Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-35591:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2021-35591` in multiple locations, including:
     - Fedora update notifications for `community-mysql` in Fedora 33, 34 and 35.
     - NetApp Security Advisory NTAP-20211022-0003, listing it among multiple MySQL vulnerabilities.
     - Oracle's October 2021 Critical Patch Update Advisory.
   - This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The root cause is described in the NetApp advisory as being due to a vulnerability in certain versions of Oracle MySQL. This is further supported by the Fedora update which states: "various flaws" in `community-mysql`.
    - The Oracle advisory indicates a broader scope of vulnerabilities affecting various MySQL components, including the server, client and connectors.
    - Specific root cause details are not provided in the supplied content, as they would normally be found in the details of individual fixes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - The content from NetApp and Oracle indicates a generic "vulnerability". The Oracle advisory uses the term "security vulnerability"
    - The provided content does not give specific details regarding what code vulnerability exists.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - The NetApp advisory outlines potential impacts:
       - Unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server.
       - Unauthorized read or modification access to MySQL Server data.
       - Denial of service (DoS) through hangs or crashes.
    - The Oracle advisory also lists unauthorized access to data and DoS as consequences of successful exploitation.
    - The Fedora update lists the CVE as associated with "various flaws", implying an unknown impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The NetApp advisory states that the vulnerabilities can be exploited over the network. This is noted in the CVSS vectors where `AV:N` (Network) is a common component.
    - The Oracle advisory mentions the MySQL protocol for some vulnerabilities.
    - The Fedora announcement doesn't specify an attack vector.
    - Some vulnerabilities in the advisory are specified as `AV:A` (Adjacent Network) requiring an attacker to be within the same local network

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   -  The NetApp advisory indicates that some vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely by an attacker without needing any form of authentication, which implies an attacker does not require any form of access, while other vulnerabilities can only be exploited by authenticated users. This can be extracted from the CVSS vectors where some have `PR:N` (No privilege required), whereas others have `PR:L` (Low) or `PR:H` (High privilege is required).
   - The Oracle advisory specifies different required privileges, where the attacker may be required to have DBA or other specific rights.
   - Based on the above it's safe to assume that:
        - A remote network attacker may exploit some vulnerabilities without any privileges.
        - A remote authenticated attacker may exploit some vulnerabilities.
        - A local attacker may be able to exploit some vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The Fedora content provides patch information, indicating that `community-mysql` was updated to address this and other related CVEs.
   - The NetApp advisory indicates which NetApp products are affected and which are not, along with remediation steps.

**Summary:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2021-35591 is a security vulnerability affecting Oracle MySQL and its components that can be exploited over the network by an attacker in certain situations with impacts potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service. Specifics of the vulnerability itself, such as a precise root cause are not included. The vulnerability has been patched in Fedora, NetApp, and Oracle Products.
