The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47611.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing validation of the extended element ID in the mac80211 subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the code was attempting to parse an extended element without first verifying if the extended element ID was present, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing input validation: The code did not validate the presence of an extended element ID before attempting to parse it.
- Out-of-bounds read: If an extended element ID was missing, the parsing logic could potentially access memory outside of the intended buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially trigger a kernel crash due to the out-of-bounds read, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted 802.11 wireless frames that lack the expected extended element ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject or manipulate 802.11 wireless frames to exploit the vulnerability. This usually requires being within wireless range of the target and the ability to craft malicious frames.
