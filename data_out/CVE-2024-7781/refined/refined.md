Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper authentication within the Social Login widget of the Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress.
*   The plugin does not properly verify the identity of a user logging in through social media accounts (Facebook, Google).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the standard login process.
*   **Insecure Social Login Implementation:** The social login functionality fails to properly validate the returned user data from social media platforms against the logged-in user or any other existing user, allowing an attacker to log in as the first user who used the social login.
*   **Vulnerable even when disabled:** The vulnerability remains exploitable as long as the social login was enabled and used at least once in the past, even if the social login widget was disabled later on.
    
**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to log in as an existing user of the WordPress site, including administrator accounts. This grants the attacker full control over the website.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The attacker can modify, delete content, install malicious plugins, and perform other actions that an administrator can perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Social Login Widget:** The attack leverages the social login functionality within the Jupiter X Core plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable plugin and its social login functionality.
*   **Social Media Account:** The attacker would need a valid account on the targeted social media platform, though it does not need to be associated to any user on the vulnerable site.
*   **Website user interacted with Social Login:** A valid user on the targeted website must have previously logged in using the social login functionality at least once.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Jupiter X Core plugin up to and including 4.7.5.
*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.7.5 and fully patched in version 4.7.8.
*   The vulnerability affects the Facebook and Google social login handlers. The code excerpts for both social login handlers show the vulnerable logic.
