Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is classified as a Content Injection issue. This typically arises from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data when it's displayed on a webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the plugin's failure to sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or script code into the website's pages and posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Content Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious content into pages and posts. This could be used to deface websites, inject spam, or deliver malicious payloads.
   - **Phishing:** The injected content can be used to create phishing pages that steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
    
**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but the description suggests it involves manipulating data that the plugin uses to generate content on the website. This could involve forms, settings or other user-controlled input that the JetFormBuilder plugin processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
