- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Attesa Extra WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through unsanitized user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a field within the plugin's functionality that is not sanitized. The content states a contributor level is required for the attacker.
