  "cveId": "CVE-2022-26361",
  "description": "The provided documents detail a vulnerability in Xen's handling of IOMMU Reserved Memory Regions (RMRR) for Intel VT-d and Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi. These regions, often used for platform tasks like legacy USB emulation, require continuous accessibility by associated devices once active. However, this requirement was violated, leading to unpredictable behavior such as IOMMU faults or memory corruption upon subsequent DMA or interrupts. The issue affects all Xen versions supporting PCI passthrough on x86 systems with IOMMU hardware. Specifically, x86 guests with passed-through physical devices that have associated RMRR or unity maps are vulnerable. Exploitation can result in a system-wide Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause lies in the improper handling of Reserved Memory Regions (RMRR) for Intel VT-d and Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi in Xen. Specifically, once a device associated with these regions is active, the mappings of these regions were not kept continuously accessible by the device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of IOMMU mappings",
      "Violation of continuous memory access requirement"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a system-wide Denial of Service (DoS). Additionally, privilege escalation and information leaks are possible but not guaranteed.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "DMA operations from PCI devices with RMRR or unity maps",
      "Interrupts from PCI devices with RMRR or unity maps"
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs a guest with physical devices passed through to it. The vulnerability is only exploitable when any such device has an associated RMRR or unity map, which is not easily discernible. The attacker needs to be able to trigger DMA or interrupts from these devices."
