- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unlimited resource allocation due to the handling of 1-RTT CRYPTO frames after the QUIC handshake is complete. The server or client continuously allocates memory for these frames without any limit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a rapid increase in memory usage on the system running the vulnerable quiche server or client, potentially leading to denial of service. This could be achieved for the duration of the connection and extended by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, specifically sending crafted QUIC packets. The attacker sends an unlimited number of 1-RTT CRYPTO frames to an established QUIC connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a QUIC connection to the vulnerable server or client and send network packets. No authentication or specific privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
