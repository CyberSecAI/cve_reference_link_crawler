- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of uploaded files in Leantime v3.0.6, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when the victim opens the malicious PDF file, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted PDF file containing embedded javascript code to the `/files/browse` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the Leantime application.
