Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a symlink (symbolic link) issue in `swtpm`. The software creates a temporary file (e.g., `TMP2-00.permall` for TPM 2). An attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file, pointing to a file they wish to overwrite. Subsequently, when `swtpm` attempts to write to the temporary file, it overwrites the file the attacker linked to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Following:** The software does not properly validate or handle symlinks when creating or writing to temporary files. It blindly follows the symlink, leading to file overwrite.
- **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The vulnerability is also made possible due to predictable naming patterns for temporary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system that the `swtpm` process has access to.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting important system files, attackers can potentially escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is primarily local, requiring the attacker to have some access to the system.
- **Access to TPM State Directory:** The attacker needs access to the TPM's state directory (specified by `--tpmstate dir=...`). This implies that the attacker already has some level of access to the system where `swtpm` is running and has knowledge of the location of the TPM state directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the machine where `swtpm` is running.
- **Access to TPM State Directory:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and symbolic links within or have access to the TPM's state directory.
- **Knowledge of `swtpm` Usage:** The attacker needs to know that `swtpm` is used and where the state directory is located.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also mentions the fix in versions v0.4.2 and v0.5.1 of `swtpm`, indicating that the vulnerability is already addressed in recent releases.
- The vulnerability is described in detail within the bug report from SUSE.
- Multiple commits were made to address this issue, showing that multiple parts of the code were involved.
