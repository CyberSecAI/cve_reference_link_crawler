| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1198395#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2022-04-12 13:28:13 UTC  ``` rh#1964465  A flaw was found in swtpm. This flaw allows an attacker to create a symbolic link with the name of the temporary file (TMP2-00.permall for TPM 2) and have this point to a valuable file. swtpm will end up overwriting the file. The success of the attack depends on the attacker having access to the TPM's state directory (--tpmstate dir=...).
