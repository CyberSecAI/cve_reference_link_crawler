- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress SiteAlert (Formerly WP Health) plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed via a crafted request triggered by a logged-in user with necessary privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into triggering a crafted request.
