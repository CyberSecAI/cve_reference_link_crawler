Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability described, specifically focusing on the `WP-Backgrounds Lite` plugin:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-4419
*   **Affected Software:** WordPress Plugin `WP-Backgrounds Lite`
*   **Affected Versions:**  <= 2.3
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Root Cause:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ino_save_data()` function. Specifically, the nonce check is skipped if the nonce parameter is not present in the request.
*  **Weakness:** The plugin uses `isset()` in combination with `wp_verify_nonce()`, where the nonce check is performed only if the nonce parameter exists, otherwise the check is skipped entirely
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious request to the affected function (`ino_save_data()`)
    *   The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into executing this request (e.g. via a link in an email or malicious website)

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to click a link or visit a webpage under the attacker's control
    *   No authentication is needed
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can save meta data via forged requests. The exact impact of this depends on what can be changed using this function.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is located in `inoplugs_background_plugin.php` at line 183:

```php
// verify nonce
if (isset($_POST['ino_meta_box_nonce']) && !wp_verify_nonce($_POST['ino_meta_box_nonce'], basename(__FILE__))) {
   return $post_id;
}
```
The code checks if `$_POST['ino_meta_box_nonce']` is set. If it is set, it then verifies the nonce. However, if it is not set, the code doesn't perform the nonce check, thus making it possible for an attacker to make the request without proper authorization.

**Additional Information from provided content:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet
* Multiple other plugins were identified with a similar issue related to improper nonce validation
* The plugin is now closed
