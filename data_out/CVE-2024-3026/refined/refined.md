- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters. Specifically, the "Custom Rel Tag" field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the "Custom Rel Tag" field when creating or editing a button in the MaxButtons plugin, and then inserting the shortcode into a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Editor role permissions to create and edit buttons in the WordPress admin panel. They also need to insert the button into a page or post.
