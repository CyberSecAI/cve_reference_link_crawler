## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WordPress Plugin Tournamatch < 4.6.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Ladders

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=trn-ladders-new
2. Add the payload `test"><script>alert(123)</script>` to the "Name" field
3. Save and see the XSS when the page reloads

### Affects Plugins
