- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings which can execute in the victim's browser. This could lead to various actions such as redirection, data theft, or session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (e.g., admin) to access the plugin settings page and inject the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator level privileges. They can inject the payload through the "Name" field when creating a new ladder, specifically on the `trn-ladders-new` page located at `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=trn-ladders-new`.
