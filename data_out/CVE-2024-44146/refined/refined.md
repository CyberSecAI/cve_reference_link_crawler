- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in `copyfile`
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient file handling logic, leading to a sandbox escape vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An app may be able to break out of its sandbox
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application can exploit the vulnerability to bypass sandbox restrictions
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious app needs to be installed on the target system.
