- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Namaste! LMS WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.6.2) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin is susceptible to XSS, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts could redirect users, display advertisements, or execute other HTML payloads when guests visit the site. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is via a malicious script injection into the website, which will then execute on the client side.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts, and a student privilege is noted as a possible way of exploitation, although not defined how.
