- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HTTP server allows state changes in GET requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection and Denial of Service. The vulnerability is due to the HTTP server not restricting state changes in GET requests, allowing for actions that should require a POST request to be performed with a GET request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can modify the configuration or reboot the affected device, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a malicious request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of a vulnerable Cisco ATA 190 series device.
