### CVE-2024-42005
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `QuerySet.values()` and `values_list()` methods handle column aliases when used with models that include a `JSONField`. When a crafted JSON object key is passed as a `*arg`, it is not properly sanitized and can be injected into the SQL query, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability: The lack of sanitization of user-provided JSON object keys when used as column aliases in `QuerySet.values()` and `values_list()` methods, enables the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, modify or delete data, or even compromise the entire database server by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves passing a crafted JSON object key as a positional argument to `QuerySet.values()` or `values_list()` methods when a model contains a `JSONField`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input that is passed to `QuerySet.values()` or `values_list()` methods. This could happen through a web interface, API, or any other route that allows external input. They would need knowledge of the database schema and model structure where a `JSONField` is in use.
