Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `ESAFENET CDG V5 EncryptPolicyType` service.
*   **Weakness:** The `DelEncryptPolicyType` interface is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. This indicates that user-supplied input (`id`) is being incorporated directly into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification or deletion, or even privilege escalation within the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through the `DelEncryptPolicyType` interface, specifically by crafting malicious SQL queries within the `id` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to send requests to the vulnerable interface. The specific authentication requirements aren't mentioned, so the attacker may or may not need prior access.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter within the `DelEncryptPolicyType` interface, a malicious actor could execute arbitrary SQL queries against the underlying database. This could lead to severe security compromises of the system.
