Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-32590:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an "incorrect status check" within the wlan (Wi-Fi) component. This leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions:**  The code fails to properly handle exceptional conditions, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
*   Use-after-free: Memory that has been freed is accessed, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation, granting the attacker system-level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local attack: An attacker needs to have local access to the device in order to trigger the vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is in the wlan (Wi-Fi) component

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the wlan component to trigger the use after free.
*   No specific execution privileges are needed, but System execution privilege can be obtained.
*   User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

**Affected Chipsets:**

*   A wide range of MediaTek chipsets are affected including: MT6761, MT6762, MT6765, MT6768, MT6769, MT6779, MT6781, MT6785, MT6789, MT6833, MT6853, MT6853T, MT6855, MT6873, MT6877, MT6879, MT6883, MT6885, MT6889, MT6891, MT6893, MT6895, MT6983, MT7663, MT7668, MT7902, MT7921, MT8167S, MT8175, MT8183, MT8185, MT8362A, MT8365, MT8385, MT8512A, MT8518, MT8532, MT8667, MT8695, MT8696, MT8766, MT8768, MT8786, MT8788, MT8789.

**Affected Software Versions:**

*   Android 11.0, 12.0 and Yocto 3.1, 3.3

**Additional Notes:**

* The severity is rated as Medium by MediaTek.
*   The issue is located in the Wi-Fi driver.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, including affected chipsets, software versions, and the specific CWE.
