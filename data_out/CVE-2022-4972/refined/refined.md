### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on several REST-API routes related to reporting within the Download Monitor plugin.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Missing Authorization: The plugin fails to properly verify user authorization before allowing access to sensitive reporting data via REST API endpoints.
- Unauthenticated Data Export: Due to the missing authorization, unauthenticated users can access and export sensitive data intended for administrators.

### Impact of exploitation
- Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain access to user data and other sensitive information meant to be restricted to administrators.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive data about downloads and users can be exposed.

### Attack vectors
- REST API: The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's REST API endpoints which lack proper authentication checks.
- Unauthenticated requests: Attackers can send requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoints without logging in.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- Unauthenticated user: An attacker does not need to have any prior access or logged-in account to exploit the vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin.
