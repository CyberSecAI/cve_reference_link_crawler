Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `bookisbn` parameter in the `admin_delete.php` file of the "Online-Bookstore-Project-In-PHP-Source-Code" application. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter, which is then directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries. Specifically the `bookisbn` parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or filter user input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System control:** In severe cases, attackers might gain full control over the system.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers might cause service disruption by manipulating the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious SQL payloads within the `bookisbn` parameter of an HTTP GET request to the `admin_delete.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required, making it an easily exploitable vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using different SQL injection techniques, including time-based blind, error-based, and boolean-based blind injections.
- The provided content includes a sample `sqlmap` command demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability (`sqlmap -u http://192.168.210.199:1213/admin_delete.php?bookisbn=978-1-49192-706-9 --batch --dbs`).
- Suggested mitigations include:
   - Using prepared statements with parameter binding.
   - Performing strict input validation and filtering.
   - Minimizing database user permissions.
   - Conducting regular security audits.
