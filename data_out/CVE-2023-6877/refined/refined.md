Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6877:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Feedzy RSS Feeds plugin when handling error messages related to invalid RSS feeds. Specifically, the `Content-Type` field of these error messages was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input (specifically, the `error_msg` variable, which is used in the error messages). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when the error message is displayed.
- The code changes in the provided changeset show that `wp_strip_all_tags` and `wp_kses_post` are used on the `$error_msg` and `$final_msg` variables in the patched version.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will be executed whenever a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Defacing websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- The vulnerability is described as a "Stored" XSS, meaning the injected script persists in the database and affects all users who view the affected page.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious RSS feed that triggers a specific error message with an injected script in the Content-Type field, which is then not sanitized when displayed.
- This malicious feed is then likely added via the plugin settings and triggered by a shortcode or widget added to a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Plugin Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to add or modify the plugin's settings or use shortcodes in order to trigger the vulnerable code path by providing a malicious RSS feed.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3.4 of the plugin by using `wp_strip_all_tags()` and `wp_kses_post()` which helps to sanitize and escape user-provided input.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file within the changeset mentions "Enhanced security" as the reason for the update to 4.3.4.
