# Submit #426440: code-projects Hospital Management System Using PHP 1,0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | code-projects Hospital Management System Using PHP 1,0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Due to insufficient user input verification for the "specilizationid" parameter, a serious SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the "Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code", allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information without logging in. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity. |
