The JS for reloading directly calls the api. Which would be no problem if it would be public with no auth. But the client-id AND the oauth token are readable in js… its easily doable via network tab in any browser with pausing the code. just do a call to a local php file which calls the api then without users can read credentials

I recently purchased the Ultima Gaming theme and Twitch Integration plugin from StreamWeasels, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience. Jamie B, the developer behind these products, has provided exceptional support throughout the entire process.
Despite my limited knowledge of WordPress and plugins, Jamie’s support has been nothing short of amazing. He has patiently guided me through any snags and hangups I encountered while using the Twitch Integration plugin, and always provided clear explanations that helped me better understand the product.
Additionally, the Ultima Gaming theme is exactly what I was looking for – it’s sleek, professional, and perfect for my gaming website. The integration with the Twitch plugin has made it incredibly easy to share my content with my audience, and the overall design of the theme is top-notch.
Overall, I would highly recommend StreamWeasels and Jamie B to anyone looking for a reliable and professional WordPress theme and plugin developer. Their support is top-notch, and the Ultima Gaming theme and Twitch Integration plugin have exceeded my expectations. Thanks again to Jamie and the StreamWeasels team!
