Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-2031:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the fact that the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and the kpasswd (password change) service in Samba share a single account and set of keys. This allows them to decrypt each other's tickets, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **TGTs from kpasswd requests:** When a user's password has expired, they should only be able to obtain tickets for the kpasswd service. However, due to a misconfiguration when canonicalizing the kpasswd principal to that of the TGS (Ticket Granting Service) when built with Heimdal Kerberos, the user could obtain TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) from ordinary kpasswd requests, even though their password should be expired and they should be restricted to kpasswd requests.
2. **Accepting kpasswd tickets as TGTs:** In Samba versions below 4.16 and in Samba builds using MIT Kerberos, the KDC incorrectly accepted kpasswd tickets as if they were TGTs. This enabled users with expired passwords to obtain tickets to services other than the password change service.
3.  **Accepting TGTs as kpasswd tickets:** Password changes could be initiated by presenting TGTs as if they were kpasswd tickets. TGTs typically have longer lifetimes than kpasswd tickets, so a stolen TGT could be used to indefinitely control an account via password change.
4.  **Accepting kpasswd tickets for self-password changes:** The kpasswd service incorrectly accepted kpasswd tickets for self password changes, where it should only accept tickets acquired directly from the KDC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** By obtaining TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) or service tickets meant for other services, a user with an expired password or the ability to forge tickets could access services they were not authorized to use, thus achieving an elevation of privilege.
*   **Account Control:** By using TGTs as kpasswd tickets, an attacker can change a user's password, potentially gaining indefinite control of an account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network access:** An attacker needs network access to communicate with the Samba server.
*   **Expired Password:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability after a user's password has expired to obtain tickets not meant for them
*   **Stolen TGT:** An attacker who has stolen a valid TGT can use it to change a user's password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Samba server.
*   **Valid Domain User:** The attacker must have an account on the domain managed by the vulnerable samba server, even if their password is expired or if they only have stolen a TGT of a valid user
*   **Ability to send kerberos requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to send kerberos requests to the vulnerable samba server.

**Additional Details**

*  The issue affects all versions of Samba prior to 4.16.4.
*  The vulnerability was present in Samba built with both Heimdal and MIT Kerberos implementations
*  The fix involves restricting the lifetime of kpasswd tickets to a maximum of two minutes and not accepting TGTs with less than two minutes left to live to avoid accepting kpasswd tickets.
*  The kpasswd service can be disabled as a workaround in some environments by setting `kpasswd port = 0` in the smb.conf.
* CVSS Score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4)
