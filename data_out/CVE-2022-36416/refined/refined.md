- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Protection mechanism failure in the Intel(R) Ethernet 500 Series Controller drivers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The drivers fail to properly enforce protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system running the vulnerable drivers.
