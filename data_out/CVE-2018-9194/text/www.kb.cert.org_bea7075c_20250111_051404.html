## TLS implementations may disclose side channel information via discrepancies between valid and invalid PKCS#1 padding

#### Vulnerability Note VU#144389

Original Release Date: 2017-12-12 | Last Revised: 2018-04-09

---

### Overview

TLS implementations may disclose side channel information via discrepancies between valid and invalid PKCS#1 padding, and may therefore be vulnerable to Bleichenbacher-style attacks. This attack is known as a "ROBOT attack".

### Description

| [**CWE-203**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)**: Information Exposure Through Discrepancy**  Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a mechanism for a security transport over network connections, and is defined in RFC 5246. TLS may utilize RSA cryptography to secure the connection, and section 7.4.7 describes how client and server may exchange keys. Implementations that don't closely follow the descriptions in RFC 5246 may leak information to an attacker when they handle PKCS #1 v1.5 padding errors in ways that lets the attacker distinguish between valid and invalid messages. An attacker may utilize discrepancies in TLS error messages to obtain the pre-master secret key private RSA key used by TLS to decrypt sensitive data. This type of attack has become known as a [Bleichenbacher attack](http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf). CERT/CC previously published CERT Advisory [CA-1998-07](https://www.cert.org/historical/advisories/CA-1998-07.cfm) for this type of attack.  Some modern cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to Bleichenbacher-style attacks on TLS. While [RFC 5246 Section 7.4.7.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7.1) provides advice in order to eliminate discrepancies and defend against Bleichenbacher attacks, implementation-specific error and exception handling may nevertheless re-introduce message discrepancies that act as a cryptographic oracle for a Bleichenbacher-style attack.  More information about the research and affected vendors is available from the [researcher's website](https://robotattack.org/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain the TLS pre-master secret (TLS session key) and decrypt TLS traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Disable TLS RSA**Affected users and system administrators are encouraged to disable TLS RSA cyphers if possible. Please refer to your product's documentation or contact the vendor's customer service.**Apply an update**Some products may have software updates available to address this issue. If an update is available, affected users are encouraged to update product software or firmware. Please see the Affected Vendors list below for more information.**Note for developers**[RFC 5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7.1) contains remediation advice for Bleichenbacher-style attacks. Developers are encouraged to review the advice and ensure implementations of TLS or software that utilizes a TLS library does not introduce further message or timing discrepancies that may be used in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. |

### Vendor Information

| The Vendor Information section below lists implementations and vendors that have been identified as vulnerable TLS implementations. Separate CVE IDs for each vendor have been assigned due to the implementation-specific nature of the vulnerability. |

### [Legion of the Bouncy Castle](#CHEU-AT5U7K) Affected

Notified:  November 15, 2017  Updated: December 12, 2017

**Statement Date:   December 12, 2017**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

BouncyCastle TLS servers, when configured to use the JCE (Java
Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, contained a weak
Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key exchange
was negotiated. This specifically includes servers using the BCJSSE
provider in its default configuration.

Affected software:
bctls-fips-1.0.2.jar and earlier versions
bctls-jdk15on-1.58.jar and earlier versions

Note that the older TLS implementation (in the
org.bouncycastle.crypto.tls package) is not vulnerable.

For FIPS users, the issue is fixed in
bctls-fips-1.0.3.jar

We recommend all FIPS users upgrade as soon as possible.

For the regular API, version 1.59 containing the fix is expected to be
available before the end of 2017. In the meantime, beta versions
beginning with 1.59b09 contain the fix, and are available from
<https://downloads.bouncycastle.org/betas/> . We recommend users upgrade
immediately to
bctls-jdk15on-159b09.jar

and then upgrade to the full 1.59 release as soon as it is available. If
continuing to deploy vulnerable versions, we strongly recommend
disabling TLS cipher suites that use RSA key exchange.
