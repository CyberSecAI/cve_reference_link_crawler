{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "TLS implementations may disclose side channel information via discrepancies between valid and invalid PKCS#1 padding, making them vulnerable to Bleichenbacher-style attacks (ROBOT attack).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure Through Discrepancy (CWE-203)",
      "Implementation-specific error and exception handling that may re-introduce message discrepancies."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain the TLS pre-master secret (TLS session key) and decrypt TLS traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted TLS messages with invalid PKCS#1 padding and observing discrepancies in the server's responses (error messages, timing, connection resets).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send TLS messages to a vulnerable server. No specific authentication is needed."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is a re-emergence of the 1998 Bleichenbacher attack, made possible by flawed implementations of TLS countermeasures. The content provides a list of affected vendors and products, including Cisco ACE/ASA, Citrix NetScaler, Erlang, F5 Networks, Bouncy Castle, wolfSSL and many others. It also recommends disabling TLS RSA ciphers as the primary mitigation strategy."
