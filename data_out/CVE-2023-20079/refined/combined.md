This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ip-phone-cmd-inj-KMFynVcP>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCVE-2023-20078 This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Multiplatform Firmware:    + IP Phone 6800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 7800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 8800 Series with Multiplatform FirmwareCVE-2023-20079 This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Multiplatform Firmware or Cisco Unified Software:    + IP Phone 6800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 7800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + ATA 191 Analog Telephone Adapter   + ATA 192 Multiplatform Analog Telephone Adapter   + IP Conference Phone 7832   + IP Conference Phone 8832   + IP DECT 110 Repeater with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP DECT 210 Multi-Cell Base Station   + IP DECT 6823 with Multiplatform Firmware   + IP Phone 7800 Series   + IP Phone 8845 and 8865   + Unified IP Phone 3905   + Video Phone 8875   + Webex Room Phone   + Webex Share   + Webex Wireless Phones 840 and 860   + Wireless IP Phone 8821  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20078: Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series Multiplatform Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with *root* privileges.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc78400](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc78400)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20078Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2023-20079: Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series Multiplatform Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd39132](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd39132) CVE ID: CVE-2023-20079Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.5CVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in the following table:  **IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series**       | Cisco Multiplatform Firmware Release | First Fixed Release for CVE-2023-20078 | First Fixed Release for CVE-2023-20079 |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 11.3.7SR1 | 11.3.7SR1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 12.0.1 | Not affected. | Not affected. |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
