- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in the `redir` handler, caused by direct input interpolation. This allows an attacker to control the redirection URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is an 'Open Redirect' [CWE-601]
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can use the FortiWeb device as a proxy to reach external or protected hosts through the redirection handlers. This could lead to the attacker redirecting users to malicious websites or using the FortiWeb device to bypass access controls to other protected resources.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a redirect parameter an attacker can trigger the vulnerable redirect handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
