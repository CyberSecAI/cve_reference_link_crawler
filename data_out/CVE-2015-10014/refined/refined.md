The provided content is a diff of a commit that introduces a fix for a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was using `gsub!` with `quote_string` on user-controlled input for SQL queries. This method was not sufficient to prevent SQL injection because it was still susceptible to injection through specific characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or modifying data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft malicious input to the various methods in the `lib/uke/finder.rb` file (by_news, by_location, by_frq_range, by_frq, by_string, by_frq_order_by_distance) that take user input, such as location data, frequency, or search strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the input parameters used in the vulnerable methods. This would likely involve controlling user input fields in the application that ultimately feed data into these methods.

**Additional notes:**
The fix was to replace the use of `quote_string` with `quote`, which provides proper escaping for SQL queries.
The vulnerable code used `gsub!` multiple times to insert the parameters into the SQL query string.
The vulnerable code is in the `lib/uke/finder.rb` file.
The commit message is "SQL injection possibility"
