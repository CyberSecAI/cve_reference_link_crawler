Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the "Update Many" API for Postgres backends within the Hasura GraphQL Engine. Specifically, there was a bug in the code that enforces row-level authorization mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is a missing authorization check that allows users to bypass intended row-level access controls when using the "Update Many" API.
- **Authorization Bypass:** This missing check leads to an authorization bypass, allowing users to update data on rows they should not have access to, based on row-level authorization policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker with update permissions on a table can modify any column they have update access to, on *any* row within that table, regardless of row-level authorization rules.
- **Unauthorized Data Retrieval:** After modifying data, the attacker can then retrieve any columns they have select permissions on from the impacted rows, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Data Consistency Issues:** This could lead to data corruption due to unauthorized modifications

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make API calls to the Hasura GraphQL Engine.
- **Specific API:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "Update Many" API for Postgres datastores.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Update Permissions:** The attacker must possess update permissions on the target table within the Hasura instance.
- **Target Version:** The Hasura GraphQL Engine must be running a vulnerable version (v2.10.0 to v2.15.1).
- **API Enabled:** The "Update Many" API must be enabled and not disabled via configuration (introduced in v2.14.0)
- **No Allow List:** The API call cannot be restricted by Allow Lists which is a security best practice.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Community, Enterprise, and Cloud editions of Hasura GraphQL Engine.
- Hasura Cloud has already been patched and is not vulnerable
- Patches have been released for affected versions
- Users on affected versions should upgrade immediately
- Workaround exists for users on 2.14.0 or later by disabling the impacted API using --experimental-features=hide\_update\_many\_fields.

This is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for unauthorized data modification and data leaks.
