As promised, a detailed announcement has been crafted and released.  You can read it here: <https://hasura.io/blog/critical-vulnerability-in-hasuras-graphql-engine-v2-10-0/> .  Please reach out to sup...@hasura.io if you have any questions or comments.
As a reminder, Hasura Cloud has already been patched and no action is needed for anything hosted through Hasura Cloud.  Any vulnerable self hosted Hasura instances should be updated per the table in the previous announcement.
