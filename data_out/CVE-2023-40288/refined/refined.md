    "attack_vector": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending crafted phishing links to BMC administrators or by logging into BMC with administrator privileges and injecting commands through an unvalidated input.",
    "required_capabilities": "To exploit the XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker needs to trick a logged-in BMC administrator into clicking a malicious link. For command injection, an attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the BMC.",
    "affected_products": "Supermicro BMC in select X11, H11, B11, CMM, M11, and H12 motherboards."
