- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will cause unintended actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
