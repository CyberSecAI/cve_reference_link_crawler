Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content relates to a Broken Access Control vulnerability in a Hotel Management System, which is a type of vulnerability commonly associated with CVEs. Specifically, the GitHub content points to a file named "Broken Access Control - View Room Entry.pdf", strongly suggesting that the vulnerability involves unauthorized access to room entry data. The kashipara.com content references a Hotel Management System project, making it plausible this relates to the CVE, though direct confirmation is not available.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a broken access control mechanism within the Hotel Management System. This implies that the system does not properly verify user permissions before granting access to sensitive information, specifically room entry data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Broken Access Control:** The system fails to enforce proper authorization, allowing users to view room entry details without the necessary permissions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** An attacker could potentially view confidential room entry information. The specific type of information available cannot be determined from this content.
    *   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access to room entry information could expose sensitive data and lead to privacy violations.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web application interface of the Hotel Management System.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would likely need to have some form of access to the web application, possibly as a low-privileged user. The specific level of access needed is not detailed.

**Additional Notes:**
* The GitHub content provides a file name ("Broken Access Control - View Room Entry.pdf") directly related to the vulnerability, suggesting the existence of a writeup or proof of concept, whereas the content from kashipara.com only references the Hotel Management System in general and does not contain specific vulnerability details.
* The kashipara.com content describes a platform for sharing project source code and ideas, including a Hotel Management System. This context suggests that the vulnerability could be present in a publicly available project.
* The information is limited to the fact that a broken access control vulnerability exists, specifically related to viewing room entry data. Details of the vulnerable code or specific exploitation methods are not available in this content.
