# Possible exposure of information vulnerability in Action Pack

High

[tenderlove](/tenderlove)
published
GHSA-wh98-p28r-vrc9
Feb 11, 2022

## Package

bundler

actionpack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0

## Patched versions

7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, 5.2.6.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a [bug in a webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation if this issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

### Patches

This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

### Workarounds

Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following middleware can be used:

```
class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
  def call(env)
    ensure_completed!
    super
  end

  private

    def ensure_completed!
      @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
    end
end

# Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
Rails.application.configure do
  config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
end
```

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-23633

### Weaknesses

[CWE-200](/advisories?query=cwe%3A200)
