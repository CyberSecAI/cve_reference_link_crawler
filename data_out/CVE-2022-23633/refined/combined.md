Multiple vunerabilities were discovered in rails, the Ruby based server-side
MVC web application framework, which could result in XSS, data disclosure
and open redirect.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:6.0.3.7+dfsg-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

For the detailed security status of rails please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rails>

## Package

bundler

actionpack
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0.0, <= 5.2.6.1
>= 6.0.0.0, <= 6.0.4.5
>= 6.1.0.0, <= 6.1.4.5
>= 7.0.0.0, <= 7.0.2.1

## Patched versions

5.2.6.2
6.0.4.6
6.1.4.6
7.0.2.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a [bug in a webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation of this issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

### Patches

This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

### Workarounds

Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following middleware can be used:

```
class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
  def call(env)
    ensure_completed!
    super
  end

  private

    def ensure_completed!
      @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
    end
end

# Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
Rails.application.configure do
  config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
end
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Subject: [CVE-2022-23633] Possible exposure of information vulnerability in
 Action Pack

## Impact

Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example
a bug in a webserver[1] or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a
response is not notified of a close, ActionDispatch::Executor will not know
to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data
being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with
ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes.

Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation if this
issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

## Patches

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 5.2-information-leak.patch
* 6.0-information-leak.patch
* 6.1-information-leak.patch
* 7.0-information-leak.patch

## Workarounds

Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the
following middleware can be used:

```
class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor
  def call(env)
    ensure_completed!
    super
  end

  private

    def ensure_completed!
      @executor.new.complete! if @executor.active?
    end
end

# Ensure the guard is inserted before ActionDispatch::Executor
Rails.application.configure do
  config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Executor, GuardedExecutor, executor
end
```

## Credits

Thanks to Jean Boussier for fixing this!

                 CVE-2022-32224

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in rails, a ruby
based MVC frame work for web development.

CVE-2022-21831

    A code injection vulnerability exists in the Active Storage that
    could allow an attacker to execute code via image_processing
    arguments.

CVE-2022-22577

    An XSS Vulnerability in Action Pack that could allow an attacker
    to bypass CSP for non HTML like responses.

CVE-2022-23633

    Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web
    requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be
    closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`,
    `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local
    state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to
    subsequent requests.

CVE-2022-27777

    A XSS Vulnerability in Action View tag helpers which would allow
    an attacker to inject content if able to control input into
    specific attributes.

CVE-2022-32224

    When serialized columns that use YAML (the default) are
    deserialized, Rails uses YAML.unsafe_load to convert the YAML data
    in to Ruby objects. If an attacker can manipulate data in the
    database (via means like SQL injection), then it may be possible
    for the attacker to escalate to an RCE.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:5.2.2.1+dfsg-1+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

For the detailed security status of rails please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rails>

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0

## Patched versions

## Description

### Impact

Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be closed, for example a [bug in a webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2812) or a bug in a Rack middleware. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`, `ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent requests, especially when interacting with `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes`.

Upgrading to the FIXED versions of Rails will ensure mitigation if this issue even in the context of a buggy webserver or middleware implementation.

### Patches

This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2.

### Workarounds

Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this problem the following middleware can be used:

```
class GuardedExecutor < ActionDispatch::Executor

  end
