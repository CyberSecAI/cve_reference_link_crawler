# Insufficient access control for OAuth2 Device Code flow

High

[BeryJu](/BeryJu)
published
GHSA-jq3m-37m7-gp45
Jun 26, 2024

## Package

authentik

## Affected versions

< 2024.6.0
< 2024.4.3
< 2024.2.4

## Patched versions

2024.6.0
2024.4.3
2024.2.4

## Description

### Impact

Due to a bug, access restrictions assigned to an application were not checked when using the OAuth2 Device code flow. This could potentially allow users without the correct authorization to get OAuth tokens for an application, and access the application.

### Patches

authentik 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3 and 2024.2.4 fix this issue, for other versions the workaround can be used.

### Workarounds

As authentik flows are still used as part of the OAuth2 Device code flow, it is possible to add access control to the configured flows.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
