| Because of <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/policy#using-distributed-features>, I'm not sure the CVE is relevant. Can it be disputed if it is not ? |

| No I haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôd need confirmation that it is a false positive. And it would probably be better if the maintainers did the dispute. |

| [@malfet](https://github.com/malfet), will you dispute the CVE? If you don't consider it a security vulnerability per <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/policy#using-distributed-features>, it is recommended that you dispute it because that way security scanners won't detect this as an important security vulnerability which will generate unnecessary noise. |

| IMHO this issue should never be classified as vulnerability with an official CVE id. [@cbornet](https://github.com/cbornet) already provided link to the official documentation: <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/policy#using-distributed-features> where is clearly written how the `torch.distributed` package works: `PyTorch Distributed features are intended for internal communication only. They are not built for use in untrusted environments or networks.`  You can work with Mitre to dispute this CVE . The CNA who assigned this CVE (in this case huntr.dev) should check documentation and discuss it wit PyTorch maintainers first. |
