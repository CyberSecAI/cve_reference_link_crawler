[`8e73f9d`](/redis/redis/commit/8e73f9d34821a937165884f13a2981883f44a074)

Upgrade urgency SECURITY: See security fixes below.

Security Fixes:

* ([CVE-2022-24834](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-p8x2-9v9q-c838)) A specially crafted Lua script executing in Redis can trigger

  a heap overflow in the cjson and cmsgpack libraries, and result in heap

  corruption and potentially remote code execution. The problem exists in all

  versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6, and affects

  only authenticated and authorized users.
* ([CVE-2023-36824](https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3)) Extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments

  may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap

  memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Specifically:

  using COMMAND GETKEYS\* and validation of key names in ACL rules.

# Bug Fixes

* Re-enable downscale rehashing while there is a fork child ([#12276](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12276))
* Fix possible hang in HRANDFIELD, SRANDMEMBER, ZRANDMEMBER when used with `<count>` ([#12276](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12276))
* Improve fairness issue in RANDOMKEY, HRANDFIELD, SRANDMEMBER, ZRANDMEMBER, SPOP, and eviction ([#12276](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12276))
* Fix WAIT to be effective after a blocked module command being unblocked ([#12220](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12220))
* Avoid unnecessary full sync after master restart in a rare case ([#12088](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12088))
