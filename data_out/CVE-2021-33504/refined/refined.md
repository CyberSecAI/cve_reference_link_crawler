| [CVE-2021-33504](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33504) | **Untrusted node addition can be manipulated in order to harvest a cluster secret.** | High | Couchbase Server | Server | Server | May 2022 |

This confirms the content is related to CVE-2021-33504

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Couchbase Server handles the addition of untrusted nodes to a cluster.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** An attacker can manipulate the process of adding an untrusted node to the cluster. This manipulation can be used to harvest a cluster secret. The exact mechanism of how the secret is harvested isn't described in this document.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to harvest a cluster secret. The document doesn't specify the exact usage of this secret. However, cluster secrets are highly sensitive data and could provide significant control over the cluster. It can likely lead to further unauthorized access, data breaches, or complete cluster compromise, given the high impact rating.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves the addition of an untrusted node to the cluster. This implies that the attacker might need to have some form of network access to the cluster or the ability to initiate node addition process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires the ability to initiate or manipulate the process of adding a node to a Couchbase cluster. The attacker needs to be in a position to introduce an untrusted node to the cluster.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-33504 describes a vulnerability where the process of adding an untrusted node to a Couchbase cluster can be manipulated to harvest a cluster secret. This could lead to a full cluster compromise.

This document provides more detail than the official CVE description by providing some context for the vulnerability (node addition process).
