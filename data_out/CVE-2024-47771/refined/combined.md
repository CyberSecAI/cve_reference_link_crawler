* Check url with homeserver

* Move check to where access-token is added

* Do IPC comm sparingly

Also added some try..catch since we create URL objects that could
potentially throw

* Check origin instead of just hostname

High

[davidegirardi](/davidegirardi)
published
GHSA-963w-49j9-gxj6
Oct 15, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 1.11.70, <= 1.11.80

## Patched versions

1.11.81

## Description

Element Desktop versions 1.11.70 through 1.11.80 contain a vulnerability which can, under specially crafted conditions, lead to the access token becoming exposed to third parties. At least one vector has been identified internally, involving malicious widgets, but other vectors may exist. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.11.81 to remediate the issue.

We classify this as a High severity security issue even if the CVSS score would be lower. CVSS score considering end-to-end encryption: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L 5.5. CVSS score ignoring end-to-end encryption: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L 6.8.

### Impact

Potential access token exposure to malicious third parties under crafted conditions.

### Workarounds

Avoid granting permissions to untrusted widgets.

### References

N/A

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47771

### Weaknesses

[CWE-200](/advisories?query=cwe%3A200)
