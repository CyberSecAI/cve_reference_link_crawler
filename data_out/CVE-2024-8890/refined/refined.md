Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-8890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The CIRCUTOR Q-SMT device, in firmware version 1.0.4, only implements the HTTP protocol, lacking a secure communication channel (HTTPS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The use of HTTP exposes sensitive data like credentials and session information as they are transmitted in cleartext.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Lack of secure channel makes it easier for an attacker to intercept and steal sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can obtain legitimate user credentials.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal active sessions and gain unauthorized access to the device.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With stolen credentials or hijacked sessions, the attacker could fully control the device, change configurations, or access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker with access to the same network as the vulnerable device can intercept network traffic and capture the HTTP communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable CIRCUTOR Q-SMT device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to sniff network traffic.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction, as indicated by the "UI:R" in the CVSS vector, implying that a user has to initiate a connection to the device for the attacker to intercept the traffic and steal credentials/sessions.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is rated as "high" severity (CVSS 8.0).
* The affected product is the CIRCUTOR Q-SMT with firmware version 1.0.4.
* The vulnerability is mitigated in CIRCUTOR Q-SMT firmware version 1.0.5.
