Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-24000:

**Root Cause:**

*   A race condition exists between the `requestPointerLock()` function and `setTimeout()`. When these are used together with specific timing, the pointer lock can be applied to a different tab than the one the user is interacting with.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Pointer Lock Application:** The `requestPointerLock()` was intended to lock the pointer to a specific tab/window; however, due to the race condition, it could be applied to an opener window while the user interacts with newly opened window.
*   **MouseEvent Misdirection:** Mouse events were still being dispatched to the origin page, even when the user had switched to another tab.
*   **UI Spoofing:** The vulnerability can be combined with certain HTML elements like `<input type="file">` or `<select><options>` to trick the user into believing that UI elements (like file upload dialogs or dropdown menus) are originating from the currently focused tab/page when they are actually controlled by the attacker's page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially trick users into submitting data (e.g. file uploads, selected dropdown values) to the attacker's page while the user believes they are interacting with the new tab.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could create misleading interfaces to steal sensitive information or induce users to perform actions they would not normally do.
*   **User Confusion:** The user's perception of which tab/page they are interacting with can be manipulated, making them vulnerable to various attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious website uses Javascript to call `requestPointerLock()` and `window.open(URL)` within a `setTimeout` block with specific timing parameters.
*   The timing of these calls is crucial to trigger the race condition.
*   The malicious website can then use the misdirected `MouseEvent` to interact with the user even though the user is focused on a different tab/window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that the victim user will visit.
*   The attacker needs to craft specific JavaScript code to exploit the race condition by calling `requestPointerLock()` and `window.open(URL)` in a specific timed sequence.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was a regression introduced by changes related to making pointer lock fission compatible and adjusting pointer lock request handling.
*   The issue was observed to be more reproducible in fresh Firefox profiles, which suggests timing differences and/or environment configuration may influence exploitability.
*   The fix involved rejecting pointer lock requests if the active tab is changed.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" severity.
* The bug report mentions that the issue is not reproducible when Fission is enabled.
