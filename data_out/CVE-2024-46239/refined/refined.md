Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the PHPGurukul Hospital Management System. User-supplied data is not sanitized or encoded before being displayed, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious scripts are stored within the database and executed when viewed by other users.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Compromised User Data:** Attackers can inject scripts to steal user session cookies, potentially gaining access to sensitive user data.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** By capturing user credentials or session tokens, attackers can hijack user accounts.
    *   **Malware Installation:** Malicious scripts can be used to redirect users to malicious websites or install malware on their machines.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **`admin/query-details.php`:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "adminremark" parameter.
    *   **`doctor/edit-profile.php`:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "docname" parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to input text into the vulnerable fields. This typically means the attacker would need a valid user account within the application.
    * The attacker also needs to be in a position to view the vulnerable fields after the malicious data is injected. For instance, in the case of the 'adminremark' parameter, the attacker would also need to have access to a location where these details are displayed.

*   **Additional Details:**
    * The vulnerability exists in version v4.0 of the PHPGurukul Hospital Management System.
    * The provided content includes screenshots as a proof of concept.
