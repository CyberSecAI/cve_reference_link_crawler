- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of the RPATH setting during MongoDB server binary builds on Linux, which can allow the server to load shared libraries from relative paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the MongoDB server binaries potentially loading shared libraries from specific relative paths, if the attacker places malicious libraries in these locations, they can be loaded by the server. This is an instance of CWE-114 (Process Control).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with host-level access could cause the MongoDB server binary to load attacker-controlled shared libraries. This could lead to full control over the MongoDB server process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves an attacker with host-level access placing malicious shared libraries in specific relative paths, which are then loaded by the MongoDB server during startup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs host-level access to the system where the vulnerable MongoDB server is installed and the ability to write to the specific relative paths the server tries to load libraries from.
