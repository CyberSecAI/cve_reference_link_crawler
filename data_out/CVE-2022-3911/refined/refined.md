- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin has an AJAX action that lacks both authorization and CSRF protection. Additionally, it fails to validate if the options being updated belong to the plugin, as long as they are structured as arrays.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Missing authorization checks on the AJAX action.
    -  Absence of CSRF protection for the AJAX action.
    -  Insufficient validation of options being updated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with minimal privileges (e.g., a subscriber) can escalate their privileges to admin level by manipulating the options, granting themselves capabilities such as `edit_plugins`, `manage_options`, etc. This allows them to fully control the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user crafts an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ajax_save_options`), including manipulated `wp_user_roles` data in the request body.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site (at least a subscriber). No other special capabilities or specific network position is required.
