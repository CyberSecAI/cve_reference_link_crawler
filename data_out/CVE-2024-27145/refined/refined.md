  "CVE-2024-27145": {
    "description": "Multiple Post-authenticated Remote Code Executions as root",
    "root_cause": "Insecure file upload vulnerability in the web interface of Toshiba multi-function printers (MFPs) allows overwriting any file on the system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file upload",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution as root, leading to complete compromise of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface",
      "HTTP POST requests to /contentwebserver/upload"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be authenticated as an admin user on the TopAccess interface to exploit this vulnerability. This access is achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities (such as clear text storage of passwords). However, the actual file upload API is then vulnerable without further authentication checks."
