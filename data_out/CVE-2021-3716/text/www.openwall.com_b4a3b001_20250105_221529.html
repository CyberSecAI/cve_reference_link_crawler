Now designated as CVE-2021-3716, affecting nbdkit versions 1.12
through 1.26.4; fixed nbdkit 1.26.5 will be released later today.

Mitigating factors: the bug is only possible when nbdkit is used in
opportunistic mode (--tls=on); you can avoid it by requesting that
nbdkit use forced tls mode (--tls=require on the command line).
Furthermore, all impacted nbdkit versions give successful replies to
repeated NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY requests even though the NBD
protocol did not mandate that, so any client that requests structured
replies after STARTTLS will not see any change in behavior in spite of
the MitM injection.  In short, the bug will only impact really old
clients that understand TLS but not structured replies (at this point,
I'm aware of qemu 2.6 through 2.10, where most distros have moved to
newer versions of qemu; and all versions of nbd-client 3.15 to the
present).
