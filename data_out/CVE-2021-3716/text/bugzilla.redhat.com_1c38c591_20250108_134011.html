| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1994695#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-08-17 17:36:03 UTC  ``` <https://nostarttls.secvuln.info/> pointed out a common implementation flaw in various SMTP and IMAP servers with regards to improperly caching plaintext state across the STARTTLS encryption boundary.  It turns out that nbdkit has the same vulnerability in regards to the NBD protocol: an attacker is able to inject a plaintext NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY before proxying everything else a client sends to the server; if the server then acts on that plaintext request (as nbdkit did before this patch), then the server ends up sending structured replies to at least NBD_CMD_READ, even though the client was not expecting them. The NBD spec has been recently tightened to declare the nbdkit behavior to be a security hole.  Depending on how the client handles unexpected structured replies, the attacker can use this to form a denial of service attack on the client, distinct from a trivial protocol downgrade attack. Please refer to the upstream announcement ([comment#10](show_bug.cgi?id=1994695#c10)) for additional details.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1994695#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-08-18 08:05:41 UTC  ``` Created nbdkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1994928](show_bug.cgi?id=1994928 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3716 nbdkit: NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY injection on STARTTLS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1994695#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2021-08-18 08:19:37 UTC  ``` This bug was introduced in nbdkit v1.11.8 (March 2019) with the first implementation of NBD Structured Replies: <https://github.com/libguestfs/nbdkit/commit/eaa4c6e9a>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1994695#c6)  Richard W.M.
