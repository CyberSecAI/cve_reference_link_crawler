### Description

The Event Manager, Events Calendar, Tickets, Registrations – Eventin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data importation due to a missing capability check on the 'import\_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to import events, speakers, schedules and attendee data.
