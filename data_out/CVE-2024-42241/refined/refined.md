{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The page cache in a shmem file, when represented by multi-index entries, has a limitation when the xarray entry is split, which occurs when PMD-sized page cache is used and HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is larger than MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of PMD-sized page cache in shmem files when using multi-index entries in the page cache and splitting of xarray entries."
    ],
    "impact": "System instability due to kernel warnings and potential crashes as indicated by the provided call trace. The issue manifests when splitting xarray entries related to PMD-sized page cache in shared memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by operations on shmem files that lead to splitting xarray entries, such as `fallocate`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A user or process with the ability to create and manipulate shared memory (shmem) files. No specific elevated privileges are explicitly mentioned beyond that."
  },
  "patch": {
    "description": "The patch disables PMD-sized page cache for shmem files when `HPAGE_PMD_ORDER` is larger than `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER`. This is achieved by adding a check in the `shmem_is_huge` function.",
    "code_changes": "The code introduces a conditional check in `shmem_is_huge` to disable PMD-sized page cache if `HPAGE_PMD_ORDER` exceeds `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER`\n```\nif (HPAGE_PMD_ORDER > MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER)\n    return false;\nreturn __shmem_is_huge(inode, index, shmem_huge_force, mm, vm_flags);\n```"
