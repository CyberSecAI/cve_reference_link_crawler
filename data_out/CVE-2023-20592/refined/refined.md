{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper or unexpected behavior of the INVD instruction in some AMD CPUs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in how the INVD instruction interacts with the CPU cache, specifically write-back behavior. This can be exploited in systems using Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) features.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious hypervisor can manipulate cache line write-back behavior, leading to a potential loss of guest virtual machine (VM) memory integrity. This means that an attacker could potentially access or modify data within the guest VM that should be protected.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious hypervisor exploiting the INVD instruction.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have control of the hypervisor to exploit the vulnerability. This positions them in a privileged location from which they can manipulate the CPU."
