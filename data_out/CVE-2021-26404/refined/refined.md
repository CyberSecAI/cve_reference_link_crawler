The provided content is related to CVE-2021-26404.

**Root Cause:** Improper input validation and bounds checking in AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) firmware.

**Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation and bounds checking in the SEV firmware which leads to information disclosure. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for a leak of scratch buffer bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Potential information disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information contained within the scratch buffer.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the SEV firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the SEV firmware, which likely means they have some level of access or control over the system.
