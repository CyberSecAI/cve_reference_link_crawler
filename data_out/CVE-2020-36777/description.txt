In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvbdev: Fix memory leak in dvb_media_device_free()

dvb_media_device_free() is leaking memory. Free `dvbdev->adapter->conn`
before setting it to NULL, as documented in include/media/media-device.h:
"The media_entity instance itself must be freed explicitly by the driver
if required."
