The provided content is related to CVE-2023-45359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `line` parameter in `VectorComponentTableOfContents.php` was not properly escaped, allowing for the injection of markup. Specifically, the `line` parameter can contain markup because headings can contain markup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper output sanitization/encoding, leading to potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code via the `line` parameter, leading to potential XSS attacks. This could result in:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `line` parameter in the table of contents component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the content of a heading that is used to generate the table of contents, and thus the `line` parameter of `VectorComponentTableOfContents.php`.
