```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The API and user auth tokens are generated using a combination of `uniqid()`, `time()`, and the website's domain, then hashed with MD5. The use of `uniqid()` which is based on current time in microseconds and is not cryptographically secure, combined with the usage of MD5 makes tokens predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure token generation using non-cryptographically secure functions (uniqid, time) and a weak hashing algorithm (MD5).
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially bypass authentication and gain access to the Bludit API by brute-forcing the predictable tokens.
- Attack vectors: Brute-forcing the tokens based on the predictability of the components used for token generation.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know the target website's domain. The API must also be enabled by the administrator.
