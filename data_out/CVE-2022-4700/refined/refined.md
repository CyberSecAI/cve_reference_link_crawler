Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the `wpr_activate_required_theme` AJAX action within the Royal Elementor Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient access control: The AJAX action does not perform capability or nonce checks, allowing any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to trigger the theme activation function.
- Lack of validation: The function does not verify if the theme to be activated ('royal-elementor-kit') is installed on the site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Any authenticated user can activate the 'royal-elementor-kit' theme.
- If the theme is not installed, the site will attempt to load a nonexistent theme, causing a loss of site availability and display an error message to visitors.
- This could lead to a temporary denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable AJAX action `wpr_activate_required_theme`.
- An attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site. Even subscriber-level permissions are sufficient.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable endpoint.
