### Description

The Easy Affiliate Links plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the eafl\_reset\_settings AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to reset the plugin's settings.
