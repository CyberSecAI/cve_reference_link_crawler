| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c0)  Patrick Del Bello    2022-11-09 18:06:51 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in Keycloak when using a client with the offline_access scope. Reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions and a lack of root session validation enabled attackers to resolve a user session attached to a different previously authenticated user.  This issue most affects users of shared computers. Suppose a user logs out of their account (without clearing their cookies) in a mobile app or similar client that includes the offline_access scope, and another user authenticates to the application. In that case, it will share the same root session id, and when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:8961 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8961](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8961)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:8962 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8962](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8962)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2022:8963 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8963](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8963)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:05:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.1  Via RHSA-2022:8965 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8965](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8965)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 15:30:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2022:8964 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8964](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8964)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2141404#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-14 10:19:51 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
