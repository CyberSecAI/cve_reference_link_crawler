  "CVE-2022-3916": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the offline_access scope in Keycloak. This issue would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are not cleared), due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions. This enables an attacker to resolve a user session attached to a previously authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of root session validation and the reuse of session IDs across root and user authentication sessions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Session takeover vulnerability."
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker can resolve a user session attached to a previously authenticated user and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to have access to a shared computer that has been previously used by another user who logged in using Keycloak with the offline_access scope enabled. The attacker must also authenticate to the application after the legitimate user has logged out without clearing cookies.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to an application that uses Keycloak with offline_access scope enabled. The attacker also needs to have access to a computer that has been used by a legitimate user that logged out without clearing cookies."
