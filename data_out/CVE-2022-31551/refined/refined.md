Based on the information available, this CVE was removed by MITRE and is not applicable.

**Additional observations:**
*   All listed vulnerabilities share the same root cause:  insecure usage of Flask's `send_file` function, leading to absolute path traversal (CWE-22).
*  All of the vulnerabilities have a CVSS score of 9.3, except for CVE-2022-31570 with 9.8 and CVE-2022-31578 with 7.5.
* The common remediation strategy provided for all these vulnerabilities is preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function, either using `flask.safe_join`, or replacing `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.
* The primary source of information about these vulnerabilities is the GitHub Security Lab issue #669.
* There is a discussion regarding the validity of CVEs for personal projects and the automation used to identify these vulnerabilities.
