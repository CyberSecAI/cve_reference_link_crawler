Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formDelDhcpRule` function of the Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of `strcpy` function when handling the `delDhcpIndex` parameter.
- The `indexSet` variable which receives the `delDhcpIndex` from a POST request is directly passed to `strcpy` without any bounds checking.
- The user-controlled `delDhcpIndex` input can exceed the buffer size allocated for `indexs` causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The stack-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially giving attackers control over the device.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) suggests the vulnerability is exploitable by sending a specially crafted POST request with a large `delDhcpIndex` value.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/goform/DelDhcpRule` endpoint.
- The `delDhcpIndex` parameter within the POST request body is used to inject the overflow payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda W15EV1.0 device.
- The attacker is able to send HTTP POST requests to the device.
- No authentication seems to be required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is W15EV1.0 V15.11.0.14.
- A proof-of-concept Python script is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The `indexs` variable is allocated on the stack with limited space.
- An image is attached to the Github content which also shows the location of the vulnerable code and the buffer overflow.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
