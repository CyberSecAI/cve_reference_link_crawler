Based on the provided changelog, the following vulnerabilities were addressed in SearchBlox version 9.1:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities were identified and fixed. These include:
    *   Username field
    *   Role field
    *   Group and New-group fields
    *   "Add cluster node" and "Name of the cluster" fields within Cluster settings
    *   Multiple fields within Featured Results settings
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A vulnerability allowed lower-privileged users to access the Admin Tab, which was fixed.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   The root cause of the Stored XSS vulnerabilities is likely due to improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before being stored and rendered in the application's interface.
*   The privilege escalation issue stemmed from an insufficient access control mechanism allowing unauthorized access to sensitive admin functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable fields. When other users access the affected pages or sections of the application, the injected script would execute within their browser. This could result in:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
*  **Privilege Escalation**: A low privileged user could gain administrative access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious payloads via vulnerable fields in the web application UI.
*  **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker with low privileged access could use the vulnerability to gain access to the administrative functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the application's user interface, specifically the vulnerable fields.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker needs a low privileged account.
