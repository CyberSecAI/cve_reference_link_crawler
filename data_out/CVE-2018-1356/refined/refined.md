- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the FortiSandbox file scan component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via the `back_url` parameter in the file scan component before rendering it in the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the user's account or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious link containing a script within the `back_url` parameter and tricking a user to click that URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and convince a user to visit the crafted URL. No specific privileges on the system are required.

The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, specifying the vulnerable parameter (`back_url`) and component (file scan).
