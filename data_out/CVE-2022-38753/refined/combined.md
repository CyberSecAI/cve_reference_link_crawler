#### API Support for Auto-Enrollment of the Web Authentication Method

An API has been introduced for the enrolling the Web Authentication method. This API supports userID parameter received from third-party services to complete the enrollment.

#### A Drop-Down list for NameID Formatting in the SAML Event

This release combines multiple NameID format options into a single list, NameID formatting options in the SAML event. This list includes the following options:

* Use Default
* Send Email as NameID (suitable for G-Suite)
* Send SAMAccount as NameID
* Send CN as NameID
* Send Immutable ID (User objectId) as NameID (required for Microsoft Office 365)

For more information, see [Creating a SAML 2.0 Event](../../server-administrator-guide/data/create_saml_20_evnt.html#create_saml_20_evnt) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Syslog Improvements

This release includes the following improvements to the Syslog records:

* Code 107 is introduced in the Syslog records to indicate the user has been locked after several failed attempts.
* CEF extensions are mapped to equivalent fields on the remote Syslog server to comply with the RFC standards.

For more information, see [Syslog](../../server-administrator-guide/data/syslog.html#syslog) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Ability to Detect the Presence of the Device Service

With this release, Advanced Authentication can detect whether the Device Service is available when the U2F method is used for authentication. If Device Service is available then use it to perform U2F authentication. If not, then initiate the Web Authentication API for validating U2F details.

#### An Option to Allow Third-Party Service Providers to Select an Event

This release introduces the Enable event selection option in Web Authentication policy to allow the third-party service providers to select a preferred event and route users to the selected event post-authentication.

For more information, see [Enabling the Event Selection](../../server-administrator-guide/data/t4jzw74udfdg.html#t4jzw74udfdg) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Support for Installing Advanced Authentication Linux PAM Client on the AIX Server Joined to the AD Domain

This release supports Advance Authentication Linux PAM Client installation on the AIX server joined to the AD domain.

For more information, see [Installing and Uninstalling Linux PAM Client on AIX Server](../../linux-pam-client/data/t4jy1apdaaja.html#t4jy1apdaaja) in the [Advanced Authentication- Linux PAM Client](../../linux-pam-client/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### A New Custom Attribute in the SAML Assertion

This release introduces an Active Directory attribute, objectGUID, to the SAML assertion for uniquely identifying an object. SAML assertion passes attributes to the Service Provider to describe the user. Users can customize the name of objectGUID attribute and send the SAML assertion as required.

For example, if a user's service provider does not recognize the objectGUID attribute but recognizes the object\_guid attribute, then the user can change the name of attribute to meet the service providerâs requirements.

### 1.2 Security Improvements

This release includes the following improvements:

* Apache Commons Text library has been updated to enhance the security.
* Resolves the potential access control bypass. ([CVE-2022-38753](https://cve.report/CVE-2022-38753))

  Micro Focus would like to offer a special thanks to Daniel Egelseer (Austria) for responsible disclosure of this security vulnerability.

## 2.0 Resolved Issues

This release includes the following software fixes:

| Component | Description |
| Administration Portal | The data and graphs displayed on the Dashboard are not up to date. The data and graph are displayed until the date when the settings are last saved. However, the data gets updated when the administrator manually updates the Dashboard Settings. |
| Administration Portal | Specifying color in the RGB format or keeping the following fields empty in the Custom Branding policy results in an error message:   * Title Text Color * Background Color * Background Color Right  Therefore, you must set the colors in the Hexadecimal format. |
| Administration Portal | The Is Expired column is removed from the Licenses widget of Dashboard, as it does not provide clear details about the expiry status of a specific license and causes confusion. |
| Administration Portal | The full synchronization process marks several active users for deletion. Due to this issue, active users cannot log in. This issue occurs after upgrading to Advanced Authentication 6.3 Service Pack 4 Patch 1 release. |
| Administration Portal | Use of special characters in the ClientID and Secret of OAuth events causes the Web Authentication parsing error. |
| Administration Portal | The customized brand settings break after upgrading to Advanced Authentication 6.4. This issue occurs due to the missing custom branding JAR file. |
| Administration Portal | Implementing the Per Tenant Hostname (PTH) feature breaks the Web Authentication method. |
| Administration Portal | The administrator is unable to remove the LDAP repository when the LDAP server is unavailable. The following error message is displayed:  Cannot connect to the LDAP server |
| Administration Portal | The existing OAuth integrations fail after the upgrade to Advanced Authentication 6.4. |
| Administration Portal | When the name and number of a particular Server Metric tile are too long, then the content that is extending outside the tile is wrapped that misaligns the tile position. |
| Administration Portal | On the Linux PAM Client, the End User License Agreement Message is not formatted properly. |
| Appliance | Deleting the reports from the Administration Portal does not delete the exported reports (CSV and JSON) in the /var/lib/docker/volumes/aaf\_aucore-data/\_data/reports path even after rebooting the appliance. |
| Appliance | The upgrade of Web Servers to Advanced Authentication 6.4 fail in the cluster environment. |
| CAF Portal | The upgrade to Advanced Authentication 6.4 fails if the connection is via proxy. |
| CAF Portal | In Advanced Authentication 6.4, exporting of the Digital Certificate results in an error. |
| Enrollment Portal | After integrating Advanced Authentication with Access Manager using the SAML event, the redirection from Access Manager to the Enrollment Portal fails and results in a 404 error. This happens due to the missing text webauth/ in the Callback URL. |
| Enrollment Portal | The enrollment of the Web Authentication Method fails even when the administrator has configured the method with valid details. |
| Linux PAM Client | When a user selects an authentication chain with the Fingerprint method on the Linux PAM client, an error message Invalid access: cannot convert empty value is displayed.  Now, if the Fingerprint reader is not connected to the Linux machine and user attempts to log in, the authentication chain with the Fingerprint method is not displayed. |
| OAuth and SAML Events | The SAML Service Provider method with improper configuration bypasses authentication and grants access without any validation to the associated OAuth and SAML events. |
| Old Enrollment Portal | On the old Enrollment Portal, enrollment of the U2F method fails when using the Chrome browser. |
| SAML Event | When Advanced Authentication and Cisco AnyConnect are integrated using the SAML event, the login page is not displayed appropriately. |
| Web Authentication | With one Web Authentication event active for a user and the user tries to log in to another Web Authentication event, an error message stating to log out from the previous event is displayed. |
| Web Authentication | An authentication attempt to the Web Authentication event fails if the Background Color is set with RGB values in the Custom Branding policy. This occurs due to the use of transparent colors. Therefore, administrators must set the colors in the Hexadecimal format. |
| Windows Client | When users try to authenticate to Windows Client using the FIDO2 method with NFC capability, an invalid error message Please connect a FIDO2 token is displayed though the reader is connected to the system. |
| Windows Client | An invalid error message is displayed when a user removes the NFC-supported card from the card reader while authenticating to Windows Client using the Card method.  Now, the following message is displayed when the user removes NFC supported card from the reader during authentication:  Tap your security key again on the reader |
