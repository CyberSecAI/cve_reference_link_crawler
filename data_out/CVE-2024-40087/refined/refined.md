```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The local service running on port 5432 uses a custom TCP protocol that does not require authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of authentication for a custom TCP service.",
    "Custom protocol is easily reverse engineered.",
     "Service uses XXTEA encryption but does not require authentication before use"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker on the LAN can change and see sensitive router settings including the SSID and WiFi password, PPPoE username and password, reboot the router, and any other functionality the Vilo app has access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker connected to the router's LAN can interact with the local service on port 5432.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same LAN as the Vilo 5 Mesh WiFi System."
