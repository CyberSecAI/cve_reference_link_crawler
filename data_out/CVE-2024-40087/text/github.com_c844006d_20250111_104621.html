# [CVE-2024-40087](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40087): No Authentication in Custom Port 5432 Service

* **CVSS Score** - 9.6, Critical ([CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))
* **Affected Product** - Vilo 5 Mesh WiFi System
* **Affected Firmware** - versions <= 5.16.1.33
* **Overview** - An attacker connected to the router's LAN can interact with the local service running on port 5432. This service uses a custom TCP protocol that is easily reverse engineered and does not require the attacker to authenticate to the router.
* **Description**
  + Anyone on the LAN can interact with the service running on port 5432, which uses a custom protocol to receive commands from the user's Vilo app mainly for setup purposes. An unauthenticated attacker can implement this protocol (which uses XXTEA encryption) to send custom messages and commands through this service.
  + The Vilo app is what normally interfaces with this service, but any attacker with knowledge of the protocol may be able to communicate with that service as if they are the app in question.
  + There are a whole host of capabilities this service has, but anything a user with the app can do, an unauthenticated attacker on the LAN can do.
  + This vulnerability also opens up several other attack vectors, as an attacker on the LAN can now exploit vulnerabilities in the specific capabilities this service offers.
* **Impact** - Any attacker on the LAN can change and see sensitive router settings including the SSID and WiFi password, PPPoE username and password, reboot the router, etc.
