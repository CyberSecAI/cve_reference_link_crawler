Prison Management System - SQL Injection on (/Admin/login.php)

Vendor Homepage:

```
https://www.sourcecodester.com/sql/17287/prison-management-system.html

```

Version:

```
V1.0

```

Tested on:

```
PHP, Apache, MySQL

```

Affected Page:

```
/Admin/login.php

```

In this scenario, user input (username and password) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any filtering or prepared statements, making the application susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

```
Userinput reaches sensitive sink. For more information, press the help icon on the left side.
11: mysqli_query $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
10: $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" . $username . "' and password = '" . $password . "'";
7: $username = $_POST['txtusername'];
8: $password = $_POST['txtpassword'];
requires:
4: if(isset($_POST['btnlogin']))

```

Proof of vulnerability:
