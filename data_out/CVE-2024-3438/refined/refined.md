Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly incorporates user-provided input (username and password) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/Admin/login.php` page of the Prison Management System.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass authentication, potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, and execute arbitrary SQL queries which can lead to complete database takeover.
- Data exfiltration, modification, or deletion could occur.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `txtusername` and `txtpassword` POST parameters in the `/Admin/login.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable page.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques are necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/Admin/login.php` in the application
- The specific line of code vulnerable is:
```php
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" . $username . "' and password = '" . $password . "'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
```
- The attacker can use tools such as sqlmap to automatically discover and exploit the vulnerability.
- The application uses PHP 7.4.33, Apache 2.4.54 and MySQL as the backend database.
- The vulnerability was confirmed using sqlmap which was able to identify a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability on the `txtusername` parameter and identify the database user as `root@localhost`.
