Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7611:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'tag' attribute within the Events Card widget of the "Enter Addons â€“ Ultimate Template Builder for Elementor" plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the 'title_tag' attribute, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. This is due to an inadequate validation check of allowed HTML tags when rendering the title, and a reliance on `tag_escape` function, which is not designed to handle complex or dangerous inputs to mitigate XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.
- User compromise: When other users access affected pages, the injected scripts can execute within their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 'tag' attribute of the Events Card widget.
- An attacker modifies the 'title_tag' setting within the Event Card Widget to include malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- Ability to use Elementor to modify page content.
- Knowledge of where to inject the payload.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `enteraddons/trunk/widgets/events_card/traits/Templates_Components.php`, specifically around lines 28-33.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.1.8.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.9.
*   The `tag_escape` function used is insufficient to sanitize and prevent XSS.
*   The fix included in version 2.1.9 addresses the security issues caused by the Event Card Widget, as well as similar issues in other widgets.
