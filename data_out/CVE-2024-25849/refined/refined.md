Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `MakeOffers::checkUserExistingOffer()` and `MakeOffers::addUserOffer()` methods within the "Make an offer" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `email`, `name`, `phone`, `message`, `amount`, and `real_price` parameters were not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises due to the lack of proper input sanitization. The methods directly incorporate user-provided strings into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** An attacker can leverage SQL injection to:
    *   Obtain admin access.
    *   Remove data from the PrestaShop database.
    *   Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to expose tokens, potentially allowing hijacking of admin AJAX scripts.
    *   Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **PrestaShop Front Controller:** The exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller, and the module's controller path can be concealed from conventional frontend logs (only showing "POST /").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploit is relatively straightforward and does not require significant technical expertise.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be carried out without requiring any user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves using the `pSQL()` function to sanitize user inputs before including them in SQL queries.
*   The advisory highlights the importance of using `pSQL` consistently and suggests upgrading to the latest PrestaShop version as a general security measure, although it does not fully prevent SQL injection.
*   It recommends changing the default database prefix and activating OWASP rules, acknowledging these methods' limitations against skilled attackers.
* The advisory is more detailed than the CVE description which only mentions "Improper neutralization of SQL parameter".
