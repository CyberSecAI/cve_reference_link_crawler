The provided content is related to CVE-2024-49863.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `vhost_scsi_get_req()` function within the Linux kernel's vhost SCSI subsystem. This is due to an oversight in handling `VIRTIO_SCSI_T_AN_*` requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that for `VIRTIO_SCSI_T_AN_*` requests, the `vc->target` is set to NULL because the target is not required. However, `vhost_scsi_get_req()` does not check if `vc->target` is NULL before dereferencing it, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a null pointer dereference, causing the vhost_worker process to crash while holding the `vq->mutex`. This leaves the corresponding Target Port Group (TPG) occupied indefinitely, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition, and preventing further SCSI requests for this TPG.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious guest sending a specifically crafted SCSI AN request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have control over a guest VM that is utilizing the vulnerable vhost SCSI functionality. They can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specific SCSI AN (Asynchronous Notification) request.
