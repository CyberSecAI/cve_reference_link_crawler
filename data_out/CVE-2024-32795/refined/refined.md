- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPCal.io WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unintended actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the crafted request. They do not need to be authenticated themselves.
