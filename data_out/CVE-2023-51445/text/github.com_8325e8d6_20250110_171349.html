This PR sets the "Content-Disposition: attachment" response header when getting files from the Resources REST API which mitigates a security issue and also fixes a bug where web browsers often download files as "f.txt". The file's Content-Type is now determined from the servlet context which seems to be more robust than the URLConnection methods and is also more controllable by the server administrator.

Note that with this PR and [#7162](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7162), the Classpath/File/Style Publisher and Resources REST API will always return the same Content-Type for a particular resource.
