# Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in REST Resources API

Moderate

[jodygarnett](/jodygarnett)
published
GHSA-fh7p-5f6g-vj2w
Mar 19, 2024

## Package

maven

org.geoserver:gs-restconfig
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<2.23.3

## Patched versions

2.23.3, 2.24.0

## Description

### Summary

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in uploaded style/legend resources that will execute in the context of another administrator's browser when viewed in the REST Resources API. Access to the REST Resources API is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators access to this endpoint should be carefully considered as it may allow access to files containing sensitive information.

### Details

Upload a new Legend via the New Style page if user has permissions for this. This file is then not checked and is uploaded to the backend system. This file can then be viewed directly by requesting it via the API which will then view the file in its raw format without sanitisation.

### PoC

1 .User makes the following request to upload file.

```
POST /geoserver/web/wicket/bookmarkable/org.geoserver.wms.web.data.StyleNewPage?11-1.IBehaviorListener.0-dialog-dialog-content-form-submit&wicket-ajax=true&wicket-ajax-baseurl=wicket%2Fbookmarkable%2Forg.geoserver.wms.web.data.StyleNewPage%3F11 HTTP/1.1

```

2. File is uploaded to the backend system and is viewable via the API at - /geoserver/rest/resourse/styles as per the screenshot above.
3. If admin user views this file the Javascript is executed and this could be used to craft a payload to steal the user's cookies(as these do not currently use HTTPOnly)

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6471928/232733694-5a994b08-53e4-4cd0-a20e-ec8717537e26.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6471928/232733694-5a994b08-53e4-4cd0-a20e-ec8717537e26.png)

Alternatively -

If the user has permissions to use the API to make PUT requests then they can directly upload malicious files as per a request below. This would be viewable in the same way as above.

PUT /geoserver/rest/resource/styles/test2.html HTTP/1.1

Host: geoserver:8080

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2Vvc2VydmVy (admin:geoserver default credentials)

Connection: close

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

### Impact

If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:

1 .Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.

2. View any information that the user is able to view.

3. Modify any information that the user is able to modify.

4. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
