### Summary:
This CVE relates to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Lifetime free Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder for WordPress VForm" plugin, affecting versions 2.1.5 and earlier. The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the plugin's forms. These scripts then execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected form.

**Root cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary web scripts can be injected.
*   Malicious scripts execute in the browsers of users who access a page with an affected form. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   No authentication is required. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
*   The attacker can inject the code via the form fields, likely through the plugin's submission mechanism.

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs before storing them or escaping them before outputting them in the form.
*   The fix involves sanitizing input using `sanitizeInput` which uses `input.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '')` to remove HTML tags, and applying `sanitize_text_field` to form inputs.
*   The vulnerable code is present in the `vformstructure.php` file, where user-submitted data is processed and saved. The fix was implemented in version 2.1.6, where a sanitization function `sanitizeInput` was introduced and applied to the form inputs before saving them.

**Affected plugin versions:**
*   All versions up to and including 2.1.5 of the "Lifetime free Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder for WordPress VForm" plugin.

**Patched version:**
*   Version 2.1.6 addresses the vulnerability by adding input sanitization using the `sanitizeInput` function as well as using `sanitize_text_field` on the form data.
