- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The default password hashing algorithm (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1) in Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP uses a low work factor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient password hashing strength due to a low work factor in the default PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can quickly crack password hashes, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the password hashes can perform offline brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack the passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the stored password hashes. This could be achieved through various means such as database compromise or other vulnerabilities leading to data exposure.
