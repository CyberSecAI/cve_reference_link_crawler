- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sarada Lite theme for WordPress lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the theme under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the vulnerable actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a cross-site request forgery attack. This means an attacker could create a malicious web page that tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the vulnerable WordPress site without the user's knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious web page or perform a similar action that triggers the CSRF attack.
