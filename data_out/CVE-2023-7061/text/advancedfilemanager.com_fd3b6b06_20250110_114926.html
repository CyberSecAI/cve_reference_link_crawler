  > It took the bland file manager within my hosting provider to a new level. I easily downloaded all of my image files to my computer. There is a limit of 1,000 images per download. With over 3,500 images it only took a few minutes. Very glad I found this plugin.

  > Excellent in every way. Indispensable when you don’t have access to the server and, in many cases, don’t even have an FTP account.

  > This is a great way to grant freelance (temp) developers quick access to the back-end files from the WP Dashboard without needing to create and managed FTP/SFTP access credentials as well. You simply add in a temp WP login plugin to your site and you’re all set.

  > This plugin has saved me a lot of work. I was having a problem with file permissions and I was recommended to install this plugin to fix the issue. I don’t have any coding experience as I was told that changing the permission rules could be dangerous to my website. Using this plugin I located the folder easily and deleted it with no problems at all. A great plugin, 10 out 10.
