### Description

The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
