### Description

The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor access or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

  > It took the bland file manager within my hosting provider to a new level. I easily downloaded all of my image files to my computer. There is a limit of 1,000 images per download. With over 3,500 images it only took a few minutes. Very glad I found this plugin.

  > This is a great way to grant freelance (temp) developers quick access to the back-end files from the WP Dashboard without needing to create and managed FTP/SFTP access credentials as well. You simply add in a temp WP login plugin to your site and you’re all set.

  > This plugin has saved me a lot of work. I was having a problem with file permissions and I was recommended to install this plugin to fix the issue. I don’t have any coding experience as I was told that changing the permission rules could be dangerous to my website. Using this plugin I located the folder easily and deleted it with no problems at all. A great plugin, 10 out 10.
