- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `portlet.js` file within the Frontend JS module of Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP. The script does not properly sanitize or handle the anchor (hash) part of a URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to an attack that injects malicious script in a URL hash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website or any other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious code in the anchor part (hash) of the URL, which is then processed by `portlet.js`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and have a user click on the link. No special capabilities are required for the user, as long as the link can be reached. The attacker does not need to be logged in, or have any access to the Liferay environment other than being able to deliver the link.
