Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL Injection vulnerability in RISE CRM 3.7.0 (CVE-2024-8945):

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a SQL query without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Blind SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Full Application Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, the attacker can achieve full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/index.php/dashboard/save` endpoint. The malicious payload is inserted into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as a client to exploit this vulnerability. However, the vulnerability is easier to exploit if user/client signup is enabled.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests, for example using a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the requests.

**Technical Details:**
- **Affected Version:** RISE CRM 3.7.0
- **Patched Version:** RISE CRM 3.7.1
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/index.php/dashboard/save`
- **Payload Examples:**
    - Successful payload (returns a 200 OK response): `-1 OR 1=1-- -`
    - Failed payload (returns a 302 Found response): `-1 OR 1=2-- -`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jobyer Ahmed.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit is publicly available on GitHub.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, who released a patch in version 3.7.1.
- The vendor agreed to public disclosure and the assignment of a CVE ID.
