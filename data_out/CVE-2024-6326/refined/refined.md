**CVE-2024-6325**

*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 insecurely stores private keys with read and execute privileges for the 'Everyone' Windows group.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Unsecured storage of private keys.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user with local access to the machine can obtain private keys. These keys could be used to impersonate resources on the secured network. Additionally, this vulnerability could allow a threat actor to exploit CVE-2022-1161 and CVE-2022-1161 if the mitigation for these CVEs was done using CIP security.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk Policy Manager v6.40 is installed.

**CVE-2024-6236**

*   **Root Cause:** The FactoryTalk System Service temporarily exposes sensitive information (private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, database folders) during backup and restore processes due to a lack of explicit permissions on the backup folder.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Exposure of sensitive information during backup/restore operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user could obtain private keys if they are able to trigger a backup or restore process. The obtained private keys can be used to impersonate resources on the secured network.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access to the machine, ability to initiate backup/restore process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where FactoryTalk System Service is installed and be able to trigger backup/restore. User interaction is also required.
