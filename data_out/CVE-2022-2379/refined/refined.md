The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Easy Student Results" WordPress plugin. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin's REST API lacks proper authorization checks. This means that anyone, including unauthenticated users, can access the API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of authorization controls in the REST API endpoints. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information, including:
    - Course details
    - Exam details
    - Department details
    - Student grades
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to student data and PII. This can lead to privacy breaches, potential identity theft, and other malicious activities.
- Exposure of sensitive academic information like grades.
- Potential for unauthorized modifications of data, although not explicitly stated, it is implied given the access to the API.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the REST API endpoints via HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs the "Enable API for Mobile Apps" setting enabled in the plugin.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site.
- Vulnerable REST API endpoints listed in the proof of concept.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the WordPress site.
- They do not need any prior knowledge of the site's users or access to the WordPress admin panel, other than knowing the plugin is enabled and that the "Enable API for Mobile Apps" setting is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides specific vulnerable endpoints that an attacker can use to retrieve the sensitive information.
- The vulnerability is classified under OWASP A5: Broken Access Control and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
- The CVSS score is 3.7 (low).

This vulnerability is a critical security concern due to the potential for wide-ranging data breaches.
