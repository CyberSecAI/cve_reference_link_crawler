Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3527-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : sox
Version        : 14.4.2+git20190427-1+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-32627
Debian Bug     : 1041112

SoX is a command line utility that can convert various formats
of computer audio files in to other formats. It can also apply
various effects to these sound files during the conversion.

Sox was vulnerable to divide by zero vulnerability by reading an
specialy crafted Creative Voice File (.voc) file, in the read_samples
function. This flaw can lead to a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
14.4.2+git20190427-1+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

For the detailed security status of sox please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sox>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
