VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Rockwell Automation used version 3.1 and 4.0 of the CVSS scoring system to assess the following vulnerabilities. The following vulnerability was reported to Rockwell Automation by Trevor Flynn.

CVE-2024-6207 IMPACT

A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the affected products that will cause the device to result in a major nonrecoverable fault (MNRF) when it receives an invalid CIP request. To exploit this vulnerability a malicious user must chain this exploits with [CVE 2021-22681](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/trust-center/security-advisories/advisory.PN1550.html) and send a specially crafted CIP message to the device.  If exploited, a threat actor could help prevent access to the legitimate user and end connections to connected devices including the workstation.  To recover the controllers, a download is required which ends any process that the controller is running.
