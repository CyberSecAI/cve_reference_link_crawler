Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9656

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize SVG files, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code within them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute whenever a user accesses the uploaded SVG file.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to phishing sites, stealing cookies, or performing other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **File upload:** Attackers upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Author-level access to the WordPress site. This means they would need to have permission to upload files to the site.
*   **Upload Permissions:**  The attacker requires the ability to upload files (specifically SVG files) via the vulnerable plugin.
