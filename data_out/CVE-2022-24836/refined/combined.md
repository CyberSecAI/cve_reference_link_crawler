Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3003-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                           Chris Lamb

Package        : ruby-nokogiri
Version        : 1.6.8.1-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24836
Debian Bug     : #1009787

It was discovered that there was a potential denial of service attack
in ruby-nokogiri, a HTML, XML, SAX etc. parser written in/for the Ruby
programming language. This was caused by the use of inefficient
regular expressions that were susceptible to excessive backtracking.

For Debian 9 "Stretch", this problem has been fixed in version
1.6.8.1-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-nokogiri please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-nokogiri>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : ruby-nokogiri
Version        : 1.10.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-5477 CVE-2020-26247 CVE-2022-24836
Debian Bug     : 934802 978967 1009787

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Nokogiri, an
HTML/XML/SAX/Reader parser for the Ruby programming language, leading
to command injection, XML external entity injection (XXE), and
denial-of-service (DoS).

CVE-2019-5477

    A command injection vulnerability allows commands to be executed
    in a subprocess via Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are
    vulnerable only if the undocumented method
    `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being called with unsafe
    user input as the filename. This vulnerability appears in code
    generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical
    is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing
    CSS queries.

CVE-2020-26247

    XXE vulnerability: XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema are
    trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed
    over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This
    behavior is counter to the security policy followed by Nokogiri
    maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default
    whenever possible.

CVE-2022-24836

    Nokogiri contains an inefficient regular expression that is
    susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to detect
    encoding in HTML documents.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.10.0+dfsg1-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-nokogiri please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-nokogiri>

Package        : ruby-nokogiri
Version        : 1.11.1+dfsg-2+deb11u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24836
Debian Bug     : 1009787

A vulnerability was discovered in Nokogiri, an open source XML and HTML
library for Ruby.  An inefficient regular expression was susceptible to
excessive backtracking when attempting to detect encoding in HTML
documents.  This could lead to denial-of-service.

For Debian 11 bullseye, this problem has been fixed in version
1.11.1+dfsg-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-nokogiri packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-nokogiri please refer to
