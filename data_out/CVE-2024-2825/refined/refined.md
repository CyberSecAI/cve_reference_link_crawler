{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/ureport/designer/saveReportFile` endpoint in EasyAdmin is vulnerable to multiple issues due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file upload via path manipulation",
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection",
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to perform:\n    * Arbitrary file uploads, potentially leading to remote code execution if permissions allow overwriting SSH configurations, writing to cron jobs, or uploading malicious executables.\n    * Read local files via XXE injection, potentially exposing sensitive information such as the `/etc/passwd` file.\n    * Perform SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal services or resources.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "file_upload": "By manipulating the 'file' parameter in the POST request to `/ureport/designer/saveReportFile` to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `file%3A../../../../../../../../../tmp/3.ureport.jpg`). The 'content' parameter contains the file's content.",
      "xxe": "By crafting a malicious XML document within the 'content' parameter of the POST request to `/ureport/designer/saveReportFile`. The XML document includes an external entity definition that attempts to read a file using the `file://` protocol (e.g., `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\">`).",
        "ssrf": "By using the same XML payload with external entity to point to internal http resource (e.g., `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"http://127.0.0.1:7777\">`) and performing SSRF."
     },
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned but may be required. Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter names ('file', 'content') and the ability to encode/craft malicious payloads are needed."
