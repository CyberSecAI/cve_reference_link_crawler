## Description

Label printers "TEPRA" PRO SR5900P / SR-R7900P provided by KING JIM CO.,LTD. contain an insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability ([CWE-522](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html)).

## Impact

An attacker who can access the products via network may obtain credentials to connect to the Wi-Fi access point with the infrastructure mode.

## Solution

**Update the Software**

The developer has released the following versions that address the vulnerability.

* Label printer "TEPRA" PRO SR5900P Ver.1.090
