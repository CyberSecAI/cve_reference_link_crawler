{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The lock's firmware allows processing of plaintext messages due to an error in the decryption function. Specifically, if the length of the ciphertext buffer, when right-shifted by 4 bits, results in 0, the decryption process is skipped, and the plaintext buffer is processed directly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Plaintext message processing: The lock's firmware processes messages without decryption if the length of the ciphertext buffer meets certain conditions.",
      "Improper input validation: The lock processes data as decrypted plaintext even when decryption is skipped, leading to unintended behavior and potential exploitation.",
    "Lack of proper message length checks: The decryption function does not correctly handle ciphertext with a length that results in a block count of 0, leading to the vulnerability."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can send arbitrary messages to the lock (with a few limitations, like a length of under 16 bytes), and cause the lock to process it without encryption. This can be leveraged to exploit other issues found in the lockâ€™s firmware.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted message to the lock with the last byte value and length set such that the decryption function skips the decryption process and proceeds directly to processing the plaintext.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the lock over BLE."
