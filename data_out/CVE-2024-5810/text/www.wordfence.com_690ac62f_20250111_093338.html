### Description

The WP2Speed Faster – Optimize PageSpeed Insights Score 90-100 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to the use of hardcoded credentials to authenticate all the incoming API requests. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to overwrite CSS, update the trial settings, purge the cache, and find attachments.
