Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way SQL queries are constructed within the `GetIDs` function of the `IDsViewHandler`. Specifically, the code was using `fmt.Sprintf` with user-provided input (`id` from `params.FilterIDs`) to build SQL `OR` conditions. This could lead to SQL injection if `params.FilterIDs` contained malicious SQL syntax.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious strings in the `FilterIDs` parameter, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL into the query, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious actions on the database.
- **Unsafe string formatting:** The code uses `fmt.Sprintf` with user-provided input, without proper sanitization, to build SQL queries which is a known unsafe practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially use the vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious input:** An attacker would need to provide specially crafted strings within the `FilterIDs` parameter of the `GetIDs` function. This parameter appears to be under the control of an external user or service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `params.FilterIDs` input to the `GetIDs` function of the `IDsViewHandler`. This would likely require them to be a user or a process that is able to call this function with arbitrary input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was resolved by replacing the unsafe string formatting with parameterized queries, which prevents SQL injection.
- The vulnerable code used the following line:
  ```go
  tx.Or(fmt.Sprintf("%s = '%s' AND %s is not null", filterIDColumnName, id, lookupIDColumnName))
  ```
- The fix introduced the following line:
  ```go
  tx.Or("? = ? AND ? is not null", filterIDColumnName, id, lookupIDColumnName)
  ```
This change replaces user-provided `id` directly in the query, with parameter placeholder that properly escapes user-provided input.
