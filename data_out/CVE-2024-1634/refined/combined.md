tried installing it multiple times and would not allow me to setup the plugin. The plugin would show as installed but i would get a blank grey screen upon clicking the plugin. I was really hoping this would work.

So far, this is a great plugin. I have the free version installed right now to help potential clients schedule a day/time to chat about their website redesign projects with me.
I created a custom thank you page (for my Gravity Form) that includes this scheduling app. People fill out an inquiry first, then schedule a meeting! It works brilliantly.
Installation was pretty easy, and I appreciate that they included the Google Calendar integration in the free version.
Pro Tip! When you install the application, they let you try the Pro version for free, so many features are available. When your trial expires, you don’t have to upgrade. You can still use the free version! You just won’t have access to pro features.

With so many scheduling plugins out there, I tried my fair share of them before finding Booking Calendar. The plugin is easy enough for even someone with no experience in design or coding to use and it has an intuitive interface that makes managing your services on your website as simple as can be!

My designer told me about this plugin and I was very pleased with how quickly I could set it up. The calendar looks modern and professional and now my clients can book with me directly online. I’m on the free version now and loving it. Going to test the premium features since I have a free trial and may upgrade at a later date if needed. I’ll be sure to update my review accordingly.

### [The BEST booking plugin!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-best-booking-plugin-4/)

After testing a few different scheduling plugins I finally found the best! StartBooking was the easiest to integrate and very intuitive. I had a couple of questions about the upgraded plan and their support team was very fast and helpful both times I reached out. The calendar looks great and didn’t require any heavy customization which I loved. The backend is also very easy to use (even for a novice like myself). I can’t recommend this plugin highly enough – it’s been a lifesaver for my business!
