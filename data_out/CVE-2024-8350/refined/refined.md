Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing authorization checks on the `/wp-json/ulgm_management/v1/edit_user/` REST API endpoint within the "Uncanny Groups for LearnDash" WordPress plugin. This allows authenticated users with "Group Leader" or higher roles to modify user data, regardless of the "Allow group leaders to edit users" setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly validate if a user has the necessary permissions to edit user details via the REST API, allowing unauthorized modifications.
- **REST API Vulnerability:** The REST API endpoint `ulgm_management/v1/edit_user/` lacks proper access controls, which bypasses the intended frontend setting that is supposed to control user editing capabilities by group leaders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** When combined with CVE-2024-8349, a Group Leader can add an existing admin user to their group, change the admin's email address, and reset the admin's password, effectively gaining administrative access to the WordPress site.
- **Unauthorized User Data Modification:** A Group Leader can modify the names and email addresses of any user on the site, regardless of group membership, as long as the user is added to the group. This has confidentiality implications since a group leader can add users to a group without user consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through network requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account with the "Group Leader" role or higher.
- **Direct API interaction**: Attackers can bypass the front end of the site and directly make POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a user with at least the "Group Leader" role on the target WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
- **Knowledge of REST API Endpoint:** The attacker must know how to form a POST request to `/wp-json/ulgm_management/v1/edit_user/` with required parameters including the user and group IDs.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if the "Allow group leaders to edit users" setting is disabled.
- Patches were released in version 6.1.1 of the plugin
- The exploit for CVE-2024-8350 is used to make the privilege escalation from CVE-2024-8349 more widespread (all group leaders can exploit the vulnerability)
