{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fromwebExcptypemanFilter` function uses `sprintf` to format a string, but does not properly check the size of the user-provided input 'page', leading to a buffer overflow when the input exceeds the buffer's capacity.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromwebExcptypemanFilter` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A buffer overflow allows an attacker to potentially overwrite stack memory, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behaviors on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "A POST request to the `/goform/webExcptypemanFilter` endpoint with a large 'page' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device, typically on the same local network as the Tenda FH1206 router."
