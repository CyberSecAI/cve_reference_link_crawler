- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity. The syslog server on FortiAnalyzer, FortiAnalyzer-BigData, and FortiManager with FortiAnalyzer features does not properly authenticate incoming syslog messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
    - Lack of proper authentication for syslog messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can send arbitrary messages to the syslog server of FortiAnalyzer, FortiAnalyzer-BigData and FortiManager by knowing an authorized device's serial number. This allows for potential manipulation or injection of log data.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote unauthenticated network access.
    - Knowledge of an authorized device's serial number.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the vulnerable system.
    - Knowledge of a valid device serial number which is used for syslog messages.
