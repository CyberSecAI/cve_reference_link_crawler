The provided content is related to CVE-2023-42798.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Release` job in AutomataCI does not perform a safety check to verify if the specified release directory (`PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE`) is a separate Git repository. If the release directory is missing, malformed, or not a separate git repository, the `GIT::hard_reset_to_init` function will reset the root repository to its initial commit.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The `Release` job fails to validate whether the `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` directory is a separate git repository.
- Missing safety check: The `GIT::hard_reset_to_init` function lacks a safety check to cross-check its root against the root repository before performing the reset.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete loss of repository data: The root repository is hard reset to its initial commit, effectively erasing all subsequent commits.
- Forced push: The changes are then force-pushed to the remote repository, resulting in the loss of the project's history and code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed release directory: The vulnerability can be triggered if the `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` directory is missing or corrupted or is not a separate git repository.
- Lack of proper setup: Improper initial configuration can cause the release directory to not be a valid git repository.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `Release` job in AutomataCI.
- User interaction is required to trigger the release job.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `GIT::hard_reset_to_init` function which is part of the `Release` job's workflow in AutomataCI.
- The issue was assigned a "Critical" severity and labeled as a security vulnerability
