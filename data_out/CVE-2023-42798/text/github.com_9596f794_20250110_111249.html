| Description Apparently, if the releases directory is missing or malformed, Release job will hard reset the root repository to its first commit and official nuke the project. This is not desirable and safety check must me added here to prevent this from happening again. Expected Behavior Safety check is added to `GIT::hard_reset_to_init` function to cross-check its root against the root repository before actually performing the reset. Current Behavior No safety check is added. Steps to Reproduce [COMPULSORY]  1. Execute everything. 2. At `./ci release` stage, observe that it shall erase the project and attempting to push to remote.  Associated Data Files *No response* |
