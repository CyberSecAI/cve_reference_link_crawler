# AutomataCI Release Job Can Nuke The Entire Repo into Nothing

High

GHSA-6q23-vhhg-8h89
Sep 22, 2023

## Package

https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI
(AutomataCI)

## Affected versions

<= 1.4.1

## Patched versions

1.5.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Users who are using AutomataCI version `v1.4.1` and below.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

User are advised to immediately upgrade to version `v1.5.0`.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Make sure the `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` (e.g. `releases/`) directory is manually and actually `git cloned` properly, making it a different git repository from the root git repository.

Otherwise, AutomataCI will get the root git repository and treating it `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` as one of its directory. This is why it mistakenly hard reset it back to first commit + force-push to remote repository (an automatic mechanism to publish a set of static materials cleanly and saving precious resources like space consumptions).

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
