## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 329 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2739494.1).

**Please note that since the release of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle WebLogic Server: [CVE-2020-14750 (November 1, 2020)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply this Critical Patch Update, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 18 new security patches for Oracle E-Business Suite.  4 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (October 2021), [My Oracle Support Note 2484000.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2484000.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

Starting with the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. Oracle has published two versions of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update Advisory: this version of the advisory implemented the change in how non-exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party components are reported, and the “traditional” advisory follows the same format as the previous advisories. The “traditional” advisory is published at <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020traditional.html>.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 403 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2712240.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Important notes:

* Jackson 2.11 added `MapperFeature.BLOCK_UNSAFE_POLYMORPHIC_BASE_TYPES` which can be enabled to prevent use of potentially unsafe 2.10-deprecated legacy methods: read more on “[Jackson 2.11 Features](https://medium.com/%40cowtowncoder/jackson-2-11-features-40cdc1d2bdf3)” blog post.
* Jackson 2.10 supports new “Safe Default Typing” via `activateDefaultTyping()` (instead of deprecated `enableDefaultTyping()`): read more on “[Jackson 2.10 Features](https://medium.com/%40cowtowncoder/jackson-2-10-features-cd880674d8a2)” blog post.

# Background

During 2017 many vulnerabilities based on so-called “serialization gadgets” (or just “gadgets”) were reported. Reports cover many different Java serialization frameworks and libraries, including Jackson.

Gadgets are classes that allow calling otherwise non-accessible methods or accessing non-accessible data, when instantiated and modified via setters and/or assignments to fields (necessary during reading of data into Objects, aka deserialization; or during writing of Objects as data, aka Serialization).
With proper initialization they will perform operations as side effects: operations that may for example allow remote execution of commands or scripts, or that expose data from the file system of server handling deserialization.

As a hypothetical example let’s consider class `Bomb` with method `setTimeToDetonate(int seconds)`, calling of which shuts down JVM (or Operating System) after specific delay. If serialization system allows construction of `Bomb` and calling of `setTimeToDetonate` (for example by passing property “timeToDetonate”) this is a valid attack vector for denial-of-service attack. Most gadgets require calling of one or more setter methods in specific order, and then allow either reading of a system file, execution of a command, or sometimes execution of code specified in payload (as byte code possibly encoded as Base64).

Originally research started with focus on default JDK serialization. A good overview is this article from 2015:

* <http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/>

which covers tools that is still being developed, updated with new exploits:

* <https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial>

# Currently Published State of the Art Gadgets

A more recent take, covering many other libraries/frameworks, can be found from:

* <https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec>

(there’s a link to pdf presentation in README: repo itself contains sample exploit(s))

This project documents about two dozen potential, commonly available gadgets over a dozen frameworks, including Jackson. Report is good reading in general so I encourage you to read (or at least skim) it if at all interested in security aspects of Object serialization.

There is also at least one existing Jackson-specific article:

* <https://adamcaudill.com/2017/10/04/exploiting-jackson-rce-cve-2017-7525/>

which explains specific exploit applicable against Jackson quite well (if not in deep detail); but I thought it would make sense to explain exact requirements (applicability of exploit) in bit more detail because the exploit described can only be used under specific circumstances and is NOT generally available just because Jackson is being used for serialization.

# Am I Affected if I Use Jackson for JSON?

As usual, the full answer is “It Depends”. But the likely answer is “probably not”. The reason for this is that for exploit to work, multiple things must be true and commonly at least one pre-requisite is not true.

But let’s look at these pre-requisite.

# What is Required for a Jackson-based “gadget” Exploit?

Simply put, exploit can work if all of these conditions are true, if your system:

1. Accepts JSON content sent by untrusted client (composed manually or by code you did not write and have no visibility or control over) — meaning that you can not constrain JSON itself that is being sent
2. Has at least one specific “gadget” class to exploit in the Java classpath: and specifically class from these that works with Jackson (most gadgets only work with specific library or libraries — most commonly reported ones for example only work with JDK serialization)
3. Enable polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type of `java.lang.Object` (or one of small number of “permissive” tag interfaces; `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`)
4. Use version of Jackson that does not (yet) block “gadget” class in question (set of published exploits grows over time so it is a race between exploits and patches)

Of these, (1) means that if you control both endpoints, this exploit is not available — but this is presumed to be the starting point since without attacker there will not be attacks (although it is worth noting that in multi-phase attack internal communication may be compromised and attacker gains access).

Point (2) simply means that some of the exploits rely on libraries that your application / service has dependencies on. Since some of “gadgets” are included in JDK itself, it is likely that you may well have at least one such type accessible.

So the main points to cover here are (3) and (4).

# What Does Polymorphic Typing Even Mean?

Let’s start with the definition of “polymorphic handling”. By default, specific types used have to be declared by POJO or caller, so you use classes like:

```
public class Person {
  public String name;
  public int age;
  public PhoneNumber phone; // embedded POJO
}
public class PhoneNumber {
  public int areaCode;
  public int local;
  // ... and so forth; not including optional getters/setters
}
```

and deserializer knows how to handle values for matching JSON values. Incoming JSON might look something like:

```
{ "name" : "Bob",
  "age" : 28.
  "phone" : {
     "areaCode" : 555,
     "local" : 1234567
  }
}
```

But in Object-Oriented Programming, you often use polymorphism: certain base type has multiple alternative implementations.
In above example we could, say, define different kinds of phone numbers (international? Cell phone?). So you could have (and yes, example is contrived — but humor me):

```
abstract class PhoneNumber {
   public int areaCode, local;
}
public class InternationalNumber extends PhoneNumber {
   public int countryCode;
}
public class DomesticNumber extends PhoneNumber { }
```

Serializing (writing out) of `Person` instances would not be problematic, as type is available and be introspected for properties. But trying to read values back would give us an exception because `Person` is an abstract type and you can not create instances of abstract types; you must use a concrete subtype. And deserializer does not know which subtype to use without further information.

Jackson can support this if we allow/require addition of “type id”: value that allows deserializer to know which subtype to create instance of. Easiest way is to use annotation `@JsonTypeInfo`, using one of two mechanisms:

```
// enable polymorphic handling for every PhoneNumber-valued property
@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)
// note: there are other ways to register subtypes, too
@JsonSubTypes({ InternationalNumber.class, DomesticNumber.class })
abstract class PhoneNumber {
}// or:
public class Person {
   @JsonTypeInfo(...) // only enable for this property!
   public PhoneNumber phone;
}
```

When doing this, serializer will add a type identifier in JSON (depending on configuration can be additional property, or array or object structure “wrapping” value); and deserializer, conversely, knows to expect this. We will see something like:

```
{ "phone" : {
   "@class" : "package.InternationalNumber",
   "areaCode" : 555,
   ...
  }
}
```

Note that this is just one of the options, regarding type id to include, and mechanism for inclusion. For more information on usage you may want to read:

* <http://www.baeldung.com/jackson-annotations>
* <http://programmerbruce.blogspot.com/2011/05/deserialize-json-with-jackson-into.html>
* <http://www.studytrails.com/java/json/java-jackson-serialization-polymorphism/>

The key part here is that if (and only if!) class name is used as the type id, then sender could send any class name they want to: within limits of type compatibility Jackson deserializer will (try to) create an instance of that type and initialize it by calling setter methods and/or setting values to fields.

# Another Way to Enable Polymorphic Handling in Jackson

So, this is the most common way to enable polymorphic handling for specific properties. But it requires annotating either all polymorphic value types, or all properties (or some combination thereof). This may not be practical, especially with 3rd party value types (although even in those cases it is possible to use this approach, with “mix-in” annotations).

Because of this reason, there is one other way to enable polymorphic handling: “Default Typing”.
Default typing is enabled via `ObjectMapper`:

```
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(); // or one of variants
```

and what it does is equivalent to adding:

```
@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS, include = As.WRAPPER_ARRAY)
```

on every property that matches inclusion criteria (which, by default, is `DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE`). In our case it would apply this to all properties with `abstract` type value, including `PhoneNumber`.

# So Is Polymorphic Handling Always Dangerous?

So far so good. With polymorphic handling attacker can potentially produce types of values that service did not mean to allow. However, this does NOT yet mean she can use actual Gadget types — remember that type to use MUST match base type. This particular case is not yet problematic, unless you happen to find a sub-class of `PhoneNumber` that is a serialization gadget — which is unlikely (or more importantly, unlikely that attacker would know such a class is available).

So we have to make another change to declaration:

```
public class Person {
  @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)
  public Object phone;
}
```

Why is this important? Because all Java classes are instances of `Object`, so now attacker can select from a wide selection of documented “gadgets”. Although only from a set that works with Jackson’s setter/field assignment (some attacks only work against JDK serialization, or against other serialization frameworks).

Also note that some other “tag” types can be similarly problematic:

* `java.util.Serializable` is implemented by many types (including many Gadget classes)
* `java.util.Comparable` and `java.lang.Cloneable` are also commonly implemented by various classes

# Is There Anything Jackson Does to Protect You?

So now we know the first 3 pre-requisites for successful exploit. But there is one more requirement.

Given that there is active research to find gadget types, Jackson databind module is being updated, incrementally, to prevent use of these types.
This means, simply put, that deserialization of a set of “well-known” Gadget types is blocked: they can not be read in via polymorphic handling (or actually even with explicit type).

Since inclusion of checks requires releasing of new versions, it is important to try to keep your Jackson version as up-to-date as possible. As of February 2019, latest versions are:

* `2.8.11`
* `2.9.8`

and these have the most recent updates.

To learn more about active development, you may also want to check out issues reported:

* <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/labels/CVE>

(note: you may want to include `closed` issues as well as open ones)

# What to do to Protect My System?

Knowing all of above, we know something about general applicability.
So here are some suggestions for further reduce likelihood of successful attacks:

1. Try to keep up with updated versions of Jackson (`jackson-databind`): it should always be safe to upgrade to the latest patch version of given minor version (safest in the sense they should be no breaking changes to functionality)
2. If possible, AVOID enabling default typing (since it is usually class name based). It is better to be explicit about specifying where polymorphism is needed.
3. AVOID using `java.lang.Object` (or, `java.util.Serializable`) as the nominal type of polymorphic values, regardless of whether you use per-type, per-property, or Default Typing
4. If possible USE “type name” and NOT classname as type id: `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME)` — this may require annotation of type name (see `@JsonTypeName` and `@JsonSubTypes`)

Especially consider the fact that if you can do either (3) or (4), you will prevent use of this class of exploits.
