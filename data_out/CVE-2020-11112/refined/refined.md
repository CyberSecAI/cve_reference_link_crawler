RELATED: CVE-2020-11112

The provided documents discuss multiple vulnerabilities related to the jackson-databind library. One of these vulnerabilities is specifically identified as CVE-2020-11112. The vulnerability exists in jackson-databind versions 2.x before 2.9.10.4.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the mishandling of interactions between serialization gadgets and typing mechanisms, related to specific classes. For CVE-2020-11112, the vulnerable class is `org.apache.commons.proxy.provider.remoting.RmiProvider`, also known as `apache/commons-proxy`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Uncontrolled deserialization: By exploiting the library's polymorphic type handling, an attacker can inject malicious objects and trigger vulnerable code paths.
- Use of serialization gadgets: The vulnerability uses known Java "gadget" classes which, when deserialized, perform actions that can lead to remote command execution or system compromise.
- Insufficient type validation/filtering: Lack of proper filtering or validation of types used during deserialization.

Impact of exploitation:
- Disclosure of sensitive information
- Addition or modification of data
- Denial of Service (DoS)

Attack vectors:
- Sending specially crafted JSON payloads containing malicious class names and data to a service using Jackson for deserialization.
- This requires a system that accepts untrusted JSON content and has the vulnerable classes available in the classpath.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to send maliciously crafted JSON to the vulnerable system.
- The targeted system must use Jackson for deserializing this JSON.
- The system needs to have the specific gadget classes present in the classpath.
- Polymorphic type handling must be enabled, specifically using class names for type identification.

Technical details and descriptions:
- The core of the issue lies in Jackson's polymorphic type handling when class names are used to identify the types to be deserialized. If an attacker can control class names, they can force the instantiation of arbitrary classes in the classpath.
- Jackson is vulnerable when it deserializes JSON data into Java Objects with an `Object` type or other permissive types like `java.util.Serializable`. An attacker could exploit this by crafting JSON content that causes Jackson to instantiate gadget classes and trigger their exploitable methods, leading to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or denial of service.
- The vulnerability is related to the way Jackson's type resolution mechanism works, particularly when it uses class names for the "type id".
- The issue is fixed in Jackson-databind 2.9.10.4, and does not affect versions 2.10.0 and later when safe default typing is used.
- Oracle and Netapp mention specific classes that are used for exploitation which should be blocked.
- Debian security advisory mentions fixes implemented in jackson-databind version 2.4.2-2+deb8u14.
- Some advice is given in the medium blog on how to mitigate the vulnerability: keeping Jackson version up to date, using type name instead of class names for type id and avoid default typing
