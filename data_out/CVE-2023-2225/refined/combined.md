## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SEO ALert <= 1.59 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Vanilla Beans » SEO Alert.
2. In "Slack Alert for" » "Slack Channel" add payload: "><audio src=x onerror=confirm("XSS")>
3. Save to get the XSS trigger.
