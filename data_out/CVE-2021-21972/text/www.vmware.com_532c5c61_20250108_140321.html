##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware ESXi
* VMware vCenter Server (vCenter Server)
* VMware Cloud Foundation (Cloud Foundation)

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi and vSphere Client (HTML5) were privately reported to VMware. Updates are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. VMware vCenter Server updates address remote code execution vulnerability in the vSphere Client (CVE-2021-21972)**

**Description**

The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability in a vCenter Server plugin. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [9.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2021-21972 apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below to affected deployments.

**Workarounds**

Workarounds for CVE-2021-21972 have been listed in the 'Workarounds' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

The affected vCenter Server plugin for vROPs is available in all default installations. vROPs does not need be present to have this endpoint available. Follow the workarounds KB to disable it.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Mikhail Klyuchnikov of Positive Technologies for reporting this issue to us.
