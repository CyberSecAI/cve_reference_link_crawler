You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password

You can reset a vCenter Server system root password with an expired password, although you must not be able to use any of the last 5 passwords.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds complexity to the password and prevents the use of expired passwords.

Networking Issues

You cannot detect uncorrected networking errors and take necessary corrective action

vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l adds five physical NIC statistics, droppedRx, droppedTx, errorsRx, RxCRCErrors and errorsTx, to the hostd.log file at /var/run/log/hostd.log

to enable you detect uncorrected networking errors and take necessary corrective action.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

Changes to local user accounts and the root account password are not synced between vCenter Server High Availability nodes

In a vCenter Server High Availability environment, creating or modifying local user accounts, or updating the root account password, might not be replicated to

the passive node.

This issue is resolved in this release.

A vCenter Server system unexpectedly powers off without a backtrace

A vCenter Server system might unexpectedly power off when a thread of the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager service becomes unresponsive due to a system

failure or when a process failure, such as a disk I/O error, occurs. However, the VMware Service Lifecycle Manager does not log a specific message for the failure.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix enables a reboot instead of a shutdown of the vCenter Server system in case of a system or process failure to make

sure you can review logs for the root cause after the reboot.

Miscellaneous Issues

The SNMP agent might intermittently stop responding and you lose system monitoring

A rare memory leak condition might cause the SNMP agent to stop responding and fail to restart. As a result, you lose system monitoring.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi host loses connectivity to a vCenter Server system and cannot reconnect

An ESXi host might intermittently lose connectivity to a vCenter Server system and fail to reconnect. In the/var/log/vmkwarning.log file you can see a message

similar to:

2020-08-01T09:05:00.648Z cpu44:2715061)WARNING: Heap: 3855: Could not allocate 2621440 bytes for dynamic heap userRes-1. Request returned Admission check failed

for memory resource.

This issue occurs when vSphere DRS reserves all memory of the virtual machines on the host. As a result, the ESXi host cannot create new threads and

processes, which in turn causes the hostd or vpxa services to fail and make the host unresponsive to the vCenter Sever system, or completely disconnecting it.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that DRS always leaves sufficient memory on the ESXi host to support the hostd or vpxa services.

Install and Upgrade Issues

In the Virtual Appliance Management Infrastructure user interface, you do not see the updated version after patching your vCenter Server system

If you use the option Stage and Install to patch your vCenter Server system without unstaging the previous version first, you still see the previous version in the

Virtual Appliance Management Infrastructure. The patch completes successfully and in the vCenter Client, and the vpxd logs, the version is correct.

This issue is resolved in this release.

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, you see vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 as an option for update along with 6.7.x release builds

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface on a vCenter Sever 6.7.x system, along with 6.7.x releases, you can also see vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 (7.0.1),

as an available update. However, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1 is a major upgrade path and should not list among 6.7.x release builds as a minor update path.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

If you have .vswp swap files in a virtual machine directory, you see Device or resource busy error messages when scanning all files in the directory

If you have .vswp swap files in a virtual machine directory, you see Device or resource busy error messages when scanning all files in the directory. You also see

extra I/O flow on vSAN namespace objects and a slow down in the hostd service.

The issue occurs if you attempt to open a file with .vswp extension as an object descriptor. The swap files of the VMX process and the virtual machine main

memory have the same extension .vswp, but the swap files of the VMX process must not be opened as object descriptors.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The vpxd service might fail while load balancing virtual machines on a vSphere DRS enabled cluster

If you set the TryBalanceVmsPerHost advanced option in vSphere DRS to 1, the vpxd service might fail and you need to restart it. The issue occurs when virtual

machines are unevenly distributed across ESXi hosts in a cluster and 2 hosts within that cluster have identical entitlements.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Server Configuration Issues

The vmware-statsmonitor service fails to start after a system reboot

If the Stats DB in your environment is large, the time for consistency checks might exceed the start timeout limit of the vmware-statsmonitor service. As a result,

the vmware-statsmonitor service fails to start after a system reboot.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vMotion Issues

When you migrate virtual machines to a vCenter Server that does not support the source EVC mode, the operation fails, and the target vCenter Server

machine fails

When you migrate a virtual machine from an EVC cluster by using vSphere vMotion, the operation might fail under the following conditions:

the virtual machine is compatible with ESX 5.0 or earlier (hardware version 8 or earlier)

the source vCenter Server is of newer version than the target vCenter Server, and the target vCenter Server does not support the source EVC cluster

mode.

The target vCenter Server machine fails as well.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Install and Upgrade Issues

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Install and Upgrade Issues

NEW: After an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l and later, you might see existing or new HPE VASA providers in disconnected state

If the inventory of your vCenter Server system has vSphere Virtual Volumes supported by either of HPE 3PAR StoreServ or HPE Primera VASA providers, you

might see the providers get into a disconnected state after an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l or later. The issue affects 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 storage, but

not 3PAR 3.3.1 MU3 storage.

Workaround: Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 1c and later. For upgrade compatibility, see VMware knowledge base article 67077. Alternatively, you

can restore your system to a backup prior to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l.

If you are not already using HPE 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 VASA provider, postpone the VASA provider upgrade to HPE 3PAR 3.3.1 MU5 until HPE resolves the issue. For

more information, see VMware knowledge base article 83038.

Auto Deploy and Image Builder Issues

If an ESXi host machine uses UEFI firmware, you cannot use VMware vSphere Auto Deploy in a VLAN network

You might not be able to use vSphere Auto Deploy to deploy an ESXi image over a VLAN network environment when the ESXi host machine uses UEFI firmware.

UEFI Secure boot fails at the ipxe binary loading stage because the implementation of VLAN support of some UEFI firmware vendors might not fully support

iPXE.

Workaround: None

Virtual Machine Management Issues

NEW: You cannot deploy virtual machines by using a VM template after an upgrade to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3l

After an upgrade to vCenter Server Update 6.7 3l, you cannot deploy virtual machines by using the Guest OS customization option and a VM template with

computer name longer than 15 characters. The issue only occurs if the computer name of the VM template exceeds 15 characters.

Workaround: Make sure that the computer name of the VM template has less than 15 characters. For more information, see VMware knowledge base

article 81832.
