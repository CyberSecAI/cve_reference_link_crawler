The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36472.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/content-manager/relations` route in Strapi does not remove private fields or prevent them from being selected, allowing access to sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: The system fails to properly restrict access to sensitive fields like `resetPasswordToken`.
- Information disclosure: User reset password tokens and other sensitive information can be exposed through the content manager views.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: A non-admin user can obtain the reset password token of an admin user, allowing them to reset the admin password and gain administrative access.
- Exposure of sensitive user information: Other tokens and user-related data can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Requires a user with "configure view" permissions in the Strapi admin panel for content-manager collection types.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a non-admin user account in the Strapi instance.
- The attacker must have the "configure view" permission for a collection type.
- The attacker must have created a content type with a relation to admin users.
- The attacker must be able to access the Strapi admin panel through the network.
