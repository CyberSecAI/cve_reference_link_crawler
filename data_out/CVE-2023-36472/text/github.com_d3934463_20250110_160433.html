## Description

### Summary

I can get access to user reset password tokens if I have the configure view permissions

[![b37a6fd9eae06027e7d91266f1908a3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34578426/246782921-fbc007d3-ffec-45de-a1f1-a4287cd507ac.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34578426/246782921-fbc007d3-ffec-45de-a1f1-a4287cd507ac.png)

### Details

/content-manager/relations route does not remove private fields or ensure that they can't be selected

### PoC

Install fresh strapi instance

start up strapi and create an account

create a new content-type

give the content-type a relation with admin users and save

go to Admin panel roles Author and then plugins.

Enable for content-manager collection types the configure view

In the collection time now only give them access to the collection you created for this.

Create a new admin user account with the Author role

Log out and request a password reset for the main admin user.

Login on the newly created account

go to the collection type you created for this test and click the create new entry button,

click in the create new entry view on configure view.

select the admin user relation we created click on resetPasswordToken

Now go back to the create an entry view and when selection the relation we created we now see the reset tokken

### Impact

Impact is that the none admin user now has the reset token of the admin users account and can resets its password using that to escalate his privilege's

Still you need the configure view permission to be able to escalate your privilege's

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
