The WordPress Access Control plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.13  via the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's "Make Website Members Only" feature (when unset) and view restricted page and post content.
