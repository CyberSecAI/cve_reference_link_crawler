- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Contec Health CMS8000 device fails to properly parse malformed network data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled resource consumption. The device crashes when processing specially formatted UDP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A threat actor can cause a denial-of-service condition, crashing the device and requiring a physical reboot. A UDP broadcast can cause a mass denial-of-service on all connected devices.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access. The attacker sends a specially crafted UDP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send UDP requests.
