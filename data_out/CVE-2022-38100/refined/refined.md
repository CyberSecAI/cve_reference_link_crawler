    "Impact of exploitation": "A threat actor can cause a denial-of-service condition, leading to a device crash that requires a physical reboot. A UDP broadcast request could cause a mass denial-of-service attack on all CME8000 devices connected to the same network.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access. A specially formatted UDP request sent by a threat actor triggers the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device. No user interaction or privileges are required."
