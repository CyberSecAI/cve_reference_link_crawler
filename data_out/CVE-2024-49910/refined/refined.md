The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49910.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `dcn401_set_output_transfer_func` function within the AMD display driver. The `set_output_gamma` function pointer was being dereferenced without a proper null check after an initial null check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code directly calls the function pointer `mpc->funcs->set_output_gamma` without ensuring it's not NULL, even though there was an earlier check on `mpc->funcs` itself. If `set_output_gamma` is NULL, this dereference leads to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash: A NULL pointer dereference typically leads to a system crash, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `dcn401_set_output_transfer_func` is called with a specific configuration where `mpc->funcs->set_output_gamma` is NULL. This occurs within the AMD display driver, suggesting the attack would involve manipulating the display settings or configuration to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the system's graphics stack to manipulate the display output and trigger the vulnerable code. This suggests either local access or the ability to modify display settings through an exploit or malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patches add a null check before dereferencing the `set_output_gamma` pointer fixing the issue.
- The patch was applied in the kernel stable tree.
- The vulnerability is in the `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/hwss/dcn401/dcn401_hwseq.c` file.
