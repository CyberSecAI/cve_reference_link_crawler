Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `commit.php` script of Ruijie RG-UAC. Specifically, the `ad_log_name` parameter received via POST request is directly passed to the `exec` function without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct execution of user-controlled data via the `exec` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/view/userAuthentication/SSO/commit.php` endpoint.
*   **`ad_log_name` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious OS commands into the `ad_log_name` POST parameter.
*   **`type` Parameter:** The `type` parameter needs to be set to `adsso_test` to satisfy the condition for command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Ruijie RG-UAC device.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint
*   **No Authentication:** The provided information suggests that authentication may not be required to exploit this vulnerability, although this is not explicitly stated.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of Ruijie RG-UAC.
*   The vulnerable URL is `/view/userAuthentication/SSO/commit.php`.
*   The vulnerable code snippet uses `exec` to process the `ad_log_name` parameter if the `type` parameter is `adsso_log_test` or in the provided exploit,  `adsso_test`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates command injection by using `sleep` command with injected arguments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a PoC demonstrating a time-based injection using `sleep` command.
*   The content includes screenshots that visualize the injection points and the overall attack vector.
