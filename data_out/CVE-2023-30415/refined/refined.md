Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `view_inquiry.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter passed through the GET request is directly injected into SQL queries without any form of validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. The attacker cannot see the direct output of the injected queries but can infer results based on response time and/or response size differences. This allows the attacker to exfiltrate information by querying the database using conditional statements and timing attacks.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable page, `view_inquiry.php`, does not properly implement authentication checks. The header function, which handles session verification, is not included in this file, making it directly accessible without requiring an admin login.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The direct usage of `$_GET['id']` within SQL queries is a critical vulnerability. The application does not sanitize or validate the input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can use the blind SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (in this case, the admin password).
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once the attacker gains admin credentials, they could potentially take full control of the application, modify data, or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability:** By extracting sensitive information, the attacker compromises confidentiality. By potentially taking control of the application, integrity of data can be compromised, and by causing the application to become unavailable, the attacker compromises availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page (`/mpms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry`), with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to understand and craft SQL queries for exploitation.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, either manually or using scripts.
*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The attacker uses a combination of blind SQL injection and a timing attack using the `SLEEP()` function to confirm the vulnerability and identify the content lengths of responses for data exfiltration.
*   The exploit provided uses a Python script to automate the process of extracting the admin password character by character.
*   The password was found to be a weak one (`admin123`) which was hashed with MD5, easily cracked.
