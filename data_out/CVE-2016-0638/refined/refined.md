Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2016-0638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a bypass of a blacklist that was implemented to prevent deserialization attacks in Oracle WebLogic. The original fix (for CVE-2015-4852) introduced a blacklist of classes that would not be deserialized. However, the fix only checked the class being directly deserialized, not classes which could be used to create a new ObjectInputStream and cause indirect deserialization to bypass the blacklist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the deserialization of untrusted data. While a blacklist was implemented, it was insufficient to prevent exploitation.
- **Bypass of Security Controls:**  The `weblogic.jms.common.StreamMessageImpl` class, specifically its `readExternal()` method, creates a new `ObjectInputStream` which reads from the input stream provided, allowing an attacker to bypass the blacklist applied in the `ServerChannelInputStream` and `MsgAbbrevInputStream`, and trigger deserialization of malicious payloads.
- **Indirect Object Creation**: The vulnerability is triggered by an object creating an `InputStream` and calling `readObject()` on it, allowing an attacker to bypass existing checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable WebLogic instance.
- **Full System Compromise:** Code execution can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, potentially including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack is performed over a network.
- **JMS (Java Messaging Service):**  The exploit is triggered via the JMS interface of WebLogic, using crafted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send data to the vulnerable WebLogic server.
- **Knowledge of WebLogic Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `StreamMessageImpl` class and its vulnerability in order to craft a working attack payload using tools like ysoserial.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payload:**  The attacker must be able to create a serialized object that, when deserialized by `StreamMessageImpl`, will trigger remote code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is a direct bypass of the fix for CVE-2015-4852 which was originally released to address deserialization vulnerabilities in WebLogic.
- The original CVE assigned to this issue was CVE-2015-4829, which was later changed to CVE-2016-0638 in the public Oracle advisory.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution.
- Oracle released a patch to address this issue as part of the April 2016 Critical Patch Update (CPU).
