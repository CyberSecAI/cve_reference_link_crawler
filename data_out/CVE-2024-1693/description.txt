The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the cdm_save_category AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 4.70. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary folder name that do not belong to them.
