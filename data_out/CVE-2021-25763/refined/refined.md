Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-25763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Weak cipher suites were enabled by default in Ktor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of weak cryptographic algorithms by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The use of weak cipher suites can make the application vulnerable to attacks that could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged. It could potentially allow an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks on the Ktor server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between clients and the vulnerable Ktor server.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of cryptography.
-The attacker would need to be able to exploit the weak cipher suites to break the encryption.
