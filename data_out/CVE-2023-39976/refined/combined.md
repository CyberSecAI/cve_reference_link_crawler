log: fix potential overflow with long log messages ([#490](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb/pull/490))

```
qb_vsnprintf_serialize was called with 'max_size' as the
limiting number for the length of the formatted log
message. But the buffer also needs to contain the
log header (given by 'actual_size'), so we now pass
't->max_line_length' as the maximum length of the
formatted log message to limit space to the actual
bytes left

Also added error checks to the blackbox calls at
the end of the test, as these now provide a proper
test that the BB is functioning. Before they were
masking failures.

FYI, the next line could theoretically be a problem if the caller used `QB_LOG_CONF_MAX_LINE_LEN` to set the max line length below the length of the "too long" message. (I wouldn't consider it a security issue since the message is hardcoded, not to mention it would be bizarre for a caller to do that). In any case, the "too long" message isn't really helpful -- why not just use as much of the long message as possible (maybe replacing the last three usable characters with an ellipsis)?

Sorry, something went wrong.

+1 for replacing "too long" message with shortened version of logged message. Also I think it may make sense to check QB\_LOG\_CONF\_MAX\_LINE\_LEN for some minimal reasonable length (right now only maximum length of QB\_LOG\_ABSOLUTE\_MAX\_LEN is checked)

Sorry, something went wrong.

1. [log: fix potential overflow with long log messages (](/ClusterLabs/libqb/commit/1bbaa929b77113532785c408dd1b41cd0521ffc8)[#490](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb/pull/490)[)](/ClusterLabs/libqb/commit/1bbaa929b77113532785c408dd1b41cd0521ffc8)
    â¦

   ```
   qb_vsnprintf_serialize was called with 'max_size' as the
   limiting number for the length of the formatted log
   message. But the buffer also needs to contain the
   log header (given by 'actual_size'), so we now pass
   't->max_line_length' as the maximum length of the
   formatted log message to limit space to the actual
   bytes left

   Also added error checks to the blackbox calls at
   the end of the test, as these now provide a proper
   test that the BB is functioning. Before they were
   masking failures.
   ```
