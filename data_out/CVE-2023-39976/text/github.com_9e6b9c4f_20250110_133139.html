1. [log: fix potential overflow with long log messages (](/ClusterLabs/libqb/commit/1bbaa929b77113532785c408dd1b41cd0521ffc8)[#490](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/libqb/pull/490)[)](/ClusterLabs/libqb/commit/1bbaa929b77113532785c408dd1b41cd0521ffc8)
    …

   ```
   qb_vsnprintf_serialize was called with 'max_size' as the
   limiting number for the length of the formatted log
   message. But the buffer also needs to contain the
   log header (given by 'actual_size'), so we now pass
   't->max_line_length' as the maximum length of the
   formatted log message to limit space to the actual
   bytes left

   Also added error checks to the blackbox calls at
   the end of the test, as these now provide a proper
   test that the BB is functioning. Before they were
   masking failures.
   ```
