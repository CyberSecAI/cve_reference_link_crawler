### @chrissie-c **[chrissie-c](/chrissie-c)** commented [Jul 19, 2023](#issue-1811749747)

qb\_vsnprintf\_serialize was called with 'max\_size' as the limiting number for the length of the formatted log message. But the buffer also needs to contain the

log header (given by 'actual\_size'), so we now pass 'max\_size - actual\_size' as the maximum length of the formatted log message.

Also added error checks to the blacbkbox calls at

the end of the test, as these now provide a proper test that the BB is functioning. Before they were

masking failures.

Sorry, something went wrong.

FYI, the next line could theoretically be a problem if the caller used `QB_LOG_CONF_MAX_LINE_LEN` to set the max line length below the length of the "too long" message. (I wouldn't consider it a security issue since the message is hardcoded, not to mention it would be bizarre for a caller to do that). In any case, the "too long" message isn't really helpful -- why not just use as much of the long message as possible (maybe replacing the last three usable characters with an ellipsis)?

+1 for replacing "too long" message with shortened version of logged message. Also I think it may make sense to check QB\_LOG\_CONF\_MAX\_LINE\_LEN for some minimal reasonable length (right now only maximum length of QB\_LOG\_ABSOLUTE\_MAX\_LEN is checked)
