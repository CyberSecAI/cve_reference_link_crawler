The provided content is an ICS advisory from CISA regarding multiple vulnerabilities in Mitsubishi Electric FA products.  CVE-2022-25155 is specifically mentioned.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of password hashes instead of the actual password for authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-836:** Use of password hash instead of password for authentication.
*   **CWE-328:** Use of weak hash algorithms.
*   **CWE-312:** Cleartext storage of sensitive information (password hashes).
*   **CWE-294:** Authentication bypass by capture-replay.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can log in to affected products without knowing the actual password, potentially allowing for unauthorized control or modifications.
*   An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by accessing files containing password hashes stored in clear text.
*   An attacker can potentially tamper with sensitive information stored in the products.
*   An attacker can potentially disclose information stored in the product.
*   An attacker can counterfeit a legitimate userâ€™s system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated network access.
*   Eavesdropping on network communication to capture password hashes or cleartext credentials.
*   Replaying captured password hashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to eavesdrop network traffic to capture authentication data
*   Ability to send network traffic to affected devices
