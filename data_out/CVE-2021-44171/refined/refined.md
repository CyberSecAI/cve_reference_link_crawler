- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the FortiOS CLI. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered through the `switch-control` CLI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-78) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can execute privileged commands on a linked FortiSwitch. This results in the potential for unauthorized code execution and the ability to carry out arbitrary actions on the FortiSwitch device.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the diagnostic CLI commands, specifically the `switch-control` command in FortiOS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the FortiOS device. The attacker also needs the ability to execute CLI commands and have the FortiOS device linked to a FortiSwitch.
