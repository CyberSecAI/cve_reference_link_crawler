A command injection vulnerability exists in Motorola CX2L router v1.0.2 and below. The vulnerability is present in the SetStationSettings function. The system directly invokes the system function to execute commands for setting parameters such as MAC address without proper input filtering. This allows malicious users to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
