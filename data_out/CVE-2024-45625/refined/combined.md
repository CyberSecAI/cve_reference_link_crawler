## Overview

WordPress Plugin "Forminator" provided by WPMU DEV contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Products Affected

## Description

## Impact

When you follow a crafted URL and access the webpage having the web form created with Forminator, an arbitrary script may be executed on your web browser.

Who hasn’t been roped into taking “IQ tests” and “figure out which Star Wars character you are” quizzes on Facebook? Now you can run all that traffic to your site. Create both knowledge and no wrong answer quizzes with Forminator.

### Collect Leads With Your Quizzes

Looking to use your quizzes for more than just entertainment and a way to engage your audience? Forminator also allows you to collect participants’ details (e.g., name, email, etc.) by integrating a lead generation form in your quiz. See how it works below:

### Gutenberg Block

Forminator’s got you, whether you’re a classic editor or Gutenberg early adapter. Say goodbye to shortcodes and quickly add forms to posts with the Forminator block for Gutenberg.

### Email Routing and Pre-Populate

Make your site more efficient from visitor input to email response times. Use query strings to pre-fill your visitor information and deliver forms direct to specific teams with email routing, auto-response and conditions.

### User Front End Post Submissions

Want to let your visitors share a post submission without needing access to the WordPress dashboard? With Forminator visitors can submit post ideas from the front end of your site so you can easily curate and publish their thoughts. Assign post to a default author, save to draft, publish immediately, etc.

### Google reCAPTCHA

You don’t want your inbox flooded with a bunch of form spam. Google ReCAPTCHA is free with Forminator. Now you can stop the crazy bots without making it hard on your visitors. No more hard to read random phrases.

### Collect, Track and GDPR Ready

Forminator stores and organizes submissions so you can sort, analyze and manage responses – of course, all while making it super easy to comply with the GDPR and other legal privacy policies.

### Import Your Existing Contact Form 7 Data

Looking to move existing forms over from CF7? Forminator’s Import Wizard allows you to migrate all, or selected forms in a matter of clicks. You can also transfer data from a range of Contact Form 7 add-ons and settings.

### Custom Login and Registration Forms

Create and embed custom login and registration forms for your sites (or multisites!). Take L&R forms to the next level: choose from a range of form fields, and customize settings, style, and behavior. Learn more in the video below:

### Multi-file Upload Field

Along with enabling single file uploads, Forminator takes things up a notch by allowing users to upload multiple files. You can also choose to set specific file types, limit the number of files that can be uploaded, as well as the individual file size. The upload field’s drag and drop interface also makes it a breeze for users to upload files.

### Group And Repeat Form Fields

The Field Group feature allows you to group any number of fields together in one form. You can also enable users to add as many additional field groups as needed when filling out your form. Great for repeatable data entry such as employment history, event attendees, lists, etc.

### Advanced Date Field Restrictions

Perfect for appointment and hotel bookings – Forminator’s Date Picker Limits feature allows you to restrict the available dates shown on your date field calendar. For example, you might show future dates only, a selected number of dates from today, dates between a specific date range, specific days of the week, and more!

### Add An E-Signature Form Field (Pro Only)\*

Have an online application that requires a signature, or a contract you need your customers to sign? Forminator’s E-signature feature allows visitors to use their mouse, trackpad, or finger (on touch devices) to leave a signature upon submitting the form. Just insert the “E-Signature” field and voila!

### Receive Subscriptions and Recurring Payments on Stripe (Pro Only)\*

Create fully-customized subscription forms with Forminator Pro’s Stripe Subscription add-on. Allow your customers to choose plans/pricing, billing cycle, custom upsells, a free trial option, and of course, make secure card payments. Forminator also saves you time by instantly and automatically syncing all subscription form data straight to your Stripe account.

\***Note:** These features are only available with [Forminator Pro](https://wpmudev.com/project/forminator-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=forminator-readme&utm_content=forminator_pro).

## FAQ

### Why choose Forminator over WPForms?

Forminator offers more features and functionalities compared to WPForms, especially in its free version. While WPForms Lite has limited access to essential tools, Forminator offers over 20 form fields, conditional logic, and comprehensive spam protection.

Additionally, Forminator provides payment integrations with both Stripe and Paypal, whereas WPForms Lite only integrates with Stripe. Forminator also supports a wider range of integrations, as well as quizzing and polling tools, advanced customization and styling options, and robust submission management. These features are available only in the pro version of WPForms.

### Does Forminator include a Gutenberg block?

It sure does. Forminator is built to work in both the Gutenberg and ClassicPress editors.

### Is Forminator GDPR Ready?

Forminator makes it easy for you to comply with the GDPR and other local privacy regulations…all the tools are included but ultimately it is up to you to implement healthy privacy and data protection on your site. Do the right thing y’all.

### Can you take payments with Forminator?

Forminator currently includes integration with the Stripe payment gateway and PayPal…both included completely free.

### Are Forminator payment options SCA compliant?

Yes! Forminator is not managing the payment processing. We worked with Stripe and PayPal to ensure the built-in integrations follow the EU’s Strong Customer Authentication regulations (PSD2).

I use this plugin frequently, but get super annoyed at the clean-up involved every time I build a form from scratch. First, a placeholder is automatically added to every single field that I have to remove because they are unnecessary and formatted specifically formatted for Australia. i.e., City=Sydney. The form labels are 14px by default, which is so tiny and does not pass Google’s accessibility guidelines. Changing the default font is also a pain because you have to scroll through hundreds of fonts for each section you want to change. It would be so nice if you could hit “N” and drop down to the fonts that start with “N”.
