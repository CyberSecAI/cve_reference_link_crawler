|  | [1] CVE-2024-22807 --> Erase flash memory sector |
|  | ================================================= |
|  |  |
|  | [Description] |
|  |  |
|  | An issue in Tormach xsTECH CNC Router, PathPilot Controller v2.9.6 |
|  | allows attackers to erase a critical sector of the flash memory, |
|  | causing the machine to lose network connectivity and suffer from |
|  | firmware corruption. |

|  | The attack involves executing commands to erase a vital flash memory sector, |
|  | causing network configuration loss and firmware corruption. |
|  | The erasure disconnects the machine from the network and corrupts its firmware, |
|  | leading to broader operational failures. The CNC router cannot connect to the network, |
|  | disrupting remote management and network-dependent operations. |
|  | The router's basic operational functionality is compromised, |
|  | potentially requiring significant intervention to restore functionality, such as re-flashing the firmware. |

|  | The primary attack vector is directly overwriting the card's name |
|  | in the device memory, potentially causing identification or operational issues. |
|  | After overwriting the card name, the attacker initiates a restart of the machine |
|  | and continues to inject the new name using an iterative injection technique, perpetuating the disruption. |

|  | Gaining unauthorized access to the shared folder over the network to access G code files. |
|  | The attacker aims to pilfer the G code files containing proprietary and valuable manufacturing information. |
|  | The stolen G code files could be sold to competitors, leading to a significant competitive disadvantage |
|  | and financial losses. The unauthorized distribution of proprietary G code files to competitors could lead to |
|  | financial harm and erosion of market position. Also, this access allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the G-code files, which can alter the operations |
|  | of the CNC machinery and lead to the production of defective products. |
|  | In addition, the attacker could deploy ransomware to encrypt the G code files, |
|  | making them unusable for CNC operations. |
