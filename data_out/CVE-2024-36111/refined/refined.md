- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's JWT token validation logic has a defect. Although a random 32-character string is generated and written to the configuration file as a JWT secret key when the key is empty, the actual JWT verification process uses the initial empty string key from the configuration file instead of the generated key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - JWT token verification bypass due to usage of empty key.
    - Inconsistent use of JWT key generation and verification.
    - Default empty JWT key in configuration file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass login authentication by generating a JWT token with an empty secret key, granting them full control of the backend. This allows for creating users and gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
