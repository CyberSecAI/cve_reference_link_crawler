Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9465:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php` file. Specifically, the `routeName` and `id` parameters, when the `action` parameter is set to `import`, are directly used within a SQL query without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries using user-controlled input without sanitization and it is accessible without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and device API keys.
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable Expedition server.
- **No Privileges:** No user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `CHECKPOINT.php` file, where SQL queries are constructed with unsanitized user input.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `routeName` parameter.
- The blog post details how to first create the necessary table using the `action=get` parameter and then trigger the SQL injection using `action=import`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform blind SQL injection using time-based payloads to extract data using tools like SQLMap.
- The Palo Alto advisory confirms that CVE-2024-9465 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.
- There is evidence of active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.
