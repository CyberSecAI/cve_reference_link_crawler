- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Adobe FrameMaker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requires low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R) .
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access and user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
