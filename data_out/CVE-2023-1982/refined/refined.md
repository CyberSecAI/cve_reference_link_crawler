- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its form settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  High-privilege users can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a new form with malicious JavaScript code in the "Label" field of the "Post Title" setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., Administrator) and be able to create and edit forms.
