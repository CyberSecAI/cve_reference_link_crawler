## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Front Editor < 4.4.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its form settings, which could allow high-privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new form.
2. For the "Post Title", add a "Label" of: <img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/); >, or <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
3. Save the form.
4. Edit the form and see JavaScript code executed.

### Affects Plugins
