## Introduction to MainWP vulnerabilities

At Patchstack we [accept vulnerability reports](https://patchstack.com/database/report/) from individual researchers but also do our own research – often by randomly selecting a plugin. This time it happens that, during a quick inspection of a MainWP extension, we found a vulnerability.

This led us to perform the same inspection in the other MainWP extensions and came to the conclusion that some of them contained one or more vulnerabilities. Some MainWP vulnerabilities are less severe, some more severe. Note that we did not perform a full audit and it may or may not contain more vulnerabilities outside of what is listed below.

These vulnerabilities range from SQL injection to authenticated post/page deletion to arbitrary file deletion. We will list all our findings below. It is important to note that MainWP responded quickly and sent us fixed versions of most of these plugins to validate its fix, however, we delayed this publication as they needed some time to test and deploy all these fixed versions.

## Conclusion

As you can see from the extensive list above, most MainWP vulnerabilities occurred due to the fact that an authorization and/or nonce token check was missing. It is important that any higher privileged actions always have both of these in place in order to prevent lower privileged users from exploiting this.

Even if there is a nonce token check but no validation of the authorization of the user, it could still be exploited if the nonce token is leaked.

## Timeline of the MainWP vulnerabilities

**End October 2022** – We found the vulnerabilities and we released a [vPatch](https://patchstack.com/articles/virtual-patching/) to all Patchstack paid version customers.
******Begin November 2022****** – We reached out to the developer of the plugin and gave them the information. The developer asked for some time to get it sorted.
******16-12-2022****** – Received the patches for us to validate. Developer asked to delay publication, so they have time to organize release of all the fixes.
**17-01-2023** – Added the vulnerabilities to the [Patchstack vulnerability database](https://patchstack.com/database/).
********17-01-2023******** – Published the article.

Websites with [Patchstack paid version](https://patchstack.com/pricing/) are protected from the vulnerabilities above and have received a vPatch at the time of finding these vulnerabilities.
