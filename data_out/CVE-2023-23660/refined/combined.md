![MainWP Vulnerabilities](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/image.png)
## Introduction to MainWP vulnerabilities

At Patchstack we [accept vulnerability reports](https://patchstack.com/database/report/) from individual researchers but also do our own research – often by randomly selecting a plugin. This time it happens that, during a quick inspection of a MainWP extension, we found a vulnerability.

This led us to perform the same inspection in the other MainWP extensions and came to the conclusion that some of them contained one or more vulnerabilities. Some MainWP vulnerabilities are less severe, some more severe. Note that we did not perform a full audit and it may or may not contain more vulnerabilities outside of what is listed below.

These vulnerabilities range from SQL injection to authenticated post/page deletion to arbitrary file deletion. We will list all our findings below. It is important to note that MainWP responded quickly and sent us fixed versions of most of these plugins to validate its fix, however, we delayed this publication as they needed some time to test and deploy all these fixed versions.

## List of MainWP vulnerabilities

**MainWP Broken Links Checker Extension (mainwp-broken-links-checker-extension)**

## Conclusion

As you can see from the extensive list above, most MainWP vulnerabilities occurred due to the fact that an authorization and/or nonce token check was missing. It is important that any higher privileged actions always have both of these in place in order to prevent lower privileged users from exploiting this.

Even if there is a nonce token check but no validation of the authorization of the user, it could still be exploited if the nonce token is leaked.

## Timeline of the MainWP vulnerabilities

**End October 2022** – We found the vulnerabilities and we released a [vPatch](https://patchstack.com/articles/virtual-patching/) to all Patchstack paid version customers.
******Begin November 2022****** – We reached out to the developer of the plugin and gave them the information. The developer asked for some time to get it sorted.
******16-12-2022****** – Received the patches for us to validate. Developer asked to delay publication, so they have time to organize release of all the fixes.
**17-01-2023** – Added the vulnerabilities to the [Patchstack vulnerability database](https://patchstack.com/database/).
********17-01-2023******** – Published the article.

Websites with [Patchstack paid version](https://patchstack.com/pricing/) are protected from the vulnerabilities above and have received a vPatch at the time of finding these vulnerabilities.

### Help us make the web a safer place

Making the WordPress ecosystem more secure is a team effort, and we believe that plugin developers and security researchers should work together.

* If you’re a **plugin developer**, join our [mVDP program](http://patchstack.com/for-plugins/) that makes it easier to report, manage and address vulnerabilities in your software.
* If you’re a **security researcher**, join [Patchstack Alliance](https://patchstack.com/bug-bounty/) to report vulnerabilities & earn rewards.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
