-  The impact can vary depending on the specific case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality that is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- User input that is not properly sanitized and validated is used to construct SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.5, indicating a high severity.
- The affected versions of the MainWP Maintenance Extension are <= 4.1.1.
- The fixed version is 4.1.2
- The vulnerability is part of a broader set of issues found in multiple MainWP extensions, primarily due to missing authorization and nonce token checks.
