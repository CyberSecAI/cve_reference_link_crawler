**Known Issues**:

* `cobbler <item> rename` is not working currently
* `cobbler <item> edit` may have bugs due to the internal refactorings

**Breaking Changes**:

* The webinterface got removed [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2434) [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2286) [#2700](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2700)
  + Please use the CLI in the meantime
  + A new webinterface is under development at <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler-web>
  + The core code has priority at any time. There are third party tools available which provide a webinterface and use

    Cobbler as a backend. A list of those tools can be found at the bottom of the following page: <https://cobbler.github.io/users.html>
* The Cobbler internal TFTP Demon got removed [#2512](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2512)
* `yaboot` support got removed as a bootloader for PowerPC [#2723](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2723)

**Announcements**:

* Important Security Bugfixes [#2794](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2794) [#2795](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795)
  + Arbitrary Read was possible through `generate_script()`
  + Arbitrary Write was possible through `upload_log_data()`
  + Log poisoning with Remote-Code-Execution was possible through any XMLRPC method which logs to the logfile.
* There was an internal refactoring from runtime created Python attributes to Python Properties. This allows much

  better data validation and thus better error handling but also introduced new bugs.
