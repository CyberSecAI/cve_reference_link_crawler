Based on the provided content, this is a patch for CVE-2024-26669.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of a mechanism to destroy chain templates when a qdisc is deleted from a network device. The stack properly removes flow offload callbacks and filters, but it fails to do the same for chain templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. When a qdisc is deleted, the associated chain templates are not destroyed, leading to unreferenced memory objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unreferenced objects of sizes 2048 and 1024 are allocated but never freed when a qdisc is deleted.
- Repeated creation and deletion of qdiscs with chain templates will lead to memory exhaustion over time, potentially causing system instability or a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with the ability to configure traffic control (tc) on a network device can trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands to configure traffic control, such as the `tc` command, on the system. This could be a local user with the necessary privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a chain with a flower classifier including a chain template, and then delete the qdisc to trigger the memory leak.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue is related to the `tcf_block_offload_unbind()` function being called before `tcf_block_flush_all_chains()` in `__tcf_block_put()`.
- The fix introduces a `tmplt_reoffload` operation in `tcf_proto_ops` and implements it in the flower classifier (`fl_tmplt_reoffload`).
- This new operation is invoked during the replay of offload removals when a qdisc is deleted.
- The `fl_tmplt_reoffload` function emits `FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_CREATE` or `FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY` commands to the underlying driver based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound or unbound.
- The patch modifies `include/net/sch_generic.h`, `net/sched/cls_api.c`, and `net/sched/cls_flower.c`.
- The fix ensures that chain templates are properly destroyed when a qdisc is removed.
