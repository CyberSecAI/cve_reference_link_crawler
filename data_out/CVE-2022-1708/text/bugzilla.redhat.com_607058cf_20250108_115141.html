Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2022-06-21 20:36:36 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |
