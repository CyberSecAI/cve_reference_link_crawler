- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A developer can create a tag with the name `refs/heads/main` pointing to a commit that doesn't contain the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the CI/CD variables defined. When a pipeline is triggered, GitLab uses the content of the tag to determine the pipeline configuration. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that protects CI/CD variables.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Bypass of intended CI/CD variable protection
    -  Ability for a developer to influence pipelines of the `main` branch using a tag.
    -  Potential for Denial of Service (DOS) by forcing pipeline failures and blocking deletion of the malicious tag

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Pipelines on the `main` branch will not have access to protected CI/CD variables, causing them to fail.
    - Potential Denial of Service, because owners can't delete the malicious tag that's causing the pipeline failures.
    
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious developer with push access can create a tag named `refs/heads/main` to a commit that does not contain CI/CD variables, and push that tag to the remote repository.
    
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a developer with push access to the project's repository.
    - The attacker needs the ability to create tags, specifically `refs/heads/main`.
