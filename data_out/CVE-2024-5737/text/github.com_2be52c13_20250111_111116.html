| Hi, You are welcome to create a PR in the repo with a fix :) But you can also add more details here in the issue description. This plugin is rather small so I guess the issue should be easily fixable. I will look into it when I get more information. Thanks for letting me know.

| There are three security issues we didn't want to post information openly without clear instruction to do so. If you want you can post your public key. That we could post here without releasing info to general public. However if you prefer to have it published publicly we can publish it in plaintext. |
