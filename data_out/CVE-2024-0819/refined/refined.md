The content is related to CVE-2024-0819.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper privilege management in TeamViewer client versions prior to 15.51.5. Specifically, access to the personal password setting does not require administrative rights.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A low-privileged user on a multi-user system can set a personal password, which is intended to be controlled by an administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user can potentially establish a remote connection to other currently logged-in users on the same system by setting their own personal password. This can lead to unauthorized access, data compromise, and system manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to a multi-user system where TeamViewer client is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with local access to a machine running an affected version of TeamViewer. The attacker must also have the ability to use the TeamViewer client interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects TeamViewer Remote full client and TeamViewer Remote Host versions prior to 15.51.5.
- The vendor recommends updating to version 15.51.5 or higher.
- Mitigation options include enabling "changes require administrative rights," setting an "options password," or using other security features such as Conditional Access, BYOC, Block & Allow List, Access control, TFA for connections, and One-time-password.
- The vendor specifically recommends using Easy Access combined with Two-Factor-Authentication for unattended access as a more secure approach than personal passwords.
