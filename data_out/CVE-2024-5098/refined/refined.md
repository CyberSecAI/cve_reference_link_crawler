Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `login.php` script of SourceCodester Simple Inventory System v1.0. Specifically, the `username` parameter received via POST request is directly concatenated into an SQL query string without any filtering, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of the `username` parameter into the SQL query without input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code into the username parameter, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the application's backend without knowing the actual credentials.
- **Data Manipulation/Exfiltration:** Although not directly demonstrated in the provided PoC, successful SQL injection can also potentially allow attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database, depending on database permissions and the nature of the injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `login.php` endpoint.
- **`username` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `$_POST['username']` within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `login.php` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and how to perform SQL injection.
