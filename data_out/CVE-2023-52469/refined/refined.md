  "CVE-2023-52469": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the AMD GPU driver within the Linux kernel.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to incorrect memory management in the `kv_parse_power_table` function of the AMD GPU driver.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to a system crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered within the AMD GPU driver. An attacker would need to trigger the execution of the vulnerable code path which involves parsing power tables, likely through a specially crafted GPU configuration or workload.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker likely needs to have some control or influence over the GPU initialization process or be able to load a malicious kernel module/driver that triggers the vulnerable code path."
