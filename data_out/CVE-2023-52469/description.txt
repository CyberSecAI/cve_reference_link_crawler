In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table

When ps allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table
frees adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control
flow goes through the following call chains:

kv_parse_power_table
  |-> kv_dpm_init
        |-> kv_dpm_sw_init
	      |-> kv_dpm_fini

The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its
first free in kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.
