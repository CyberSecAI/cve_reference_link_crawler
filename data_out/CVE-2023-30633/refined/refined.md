**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `TrEEConfigDriver` module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- This can cause a vulnerable device to report false PCR values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Devices can masquerade as healthy by reporting false PCR values.
- This can mask malware activity since PCR measurements are used by Windows to determine device health.
- The integrity of the boot process is compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the target device is required.
- Alternatively, an attacker who has already compromised a legitimate user's credentials could also exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable device.
- Or, the attacker would need to have compromised a legitimate user's account.

**Additional Details:**
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.1, with vector string AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N.
