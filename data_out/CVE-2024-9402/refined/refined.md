**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory safety bugs that can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed beyond the existence of memory safety bugs, and successful exploitation is stated to require "enough effort". It can be inferred that the vulnerability can be triggered by malicious or crafted content processed by the browser/application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the memory corruption bugs, likely through malicious content.
