The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27087.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the "Custom" link type within the Kirby CMS link field, which allows the use of `javascript:` URL schemes. This lack of sanitization enables execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when a user clicks on a link generated from the field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the link field's "Custom" type.
*   Lack of proper input validation and sanitization for the "Custom" link type, allowing `javascript:` URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the Panel session of the user who clicks on the malicious link.
*   Potential for attackers to trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim, potentially leading to privilege escalation if an admin's session is compromised.
*   Other JavaScript-powered attacks depending on the site's implementation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious `javascript:` URLs into the "Custom" link type field.
*   The attack requires user interaction. A user (another user or visitor) needs to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to input content into the Kirby CMS link field using the custom link type.
*   The attacker needs low privileges to introduce the malicious link.
*   The attack requires the user to be authenticated and access the Panel session.
