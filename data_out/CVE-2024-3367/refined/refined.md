- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `websphere_mq` plugin used the output of `ps` to determine an argument for `runmqsc`. This allows an attacker who can launch processes with an arbitrary command line to manipulate an argument to `runmqsc`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure use of process information to construct arguments for command execution, specifically `runmqsc`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with the ability to launch processes with an arbitrary command line could manipulate arguments passed to `runmqsc`, potentially leading to unauthorized actions. The impact is rated as High Integrity (I:H) due to the ability to alter command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack via command injection through process listing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be able to launch processes with an arbitrary command line on the system where the Checkmk agent is running.
