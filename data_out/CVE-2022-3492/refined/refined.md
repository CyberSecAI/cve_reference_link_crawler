- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application constructs OS commands using externally influenced input from the `parameter` argument within the "Profile Photo Handler" component without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `parameter` argument in the "Profile Photo Handler" component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable component. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
