### Description

The Disable Json API, Login Lockdown, XMLRPC, Pingback, Stop User Enumeration Anti Hacker Scan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the antihacker\_truncate\_scan\_table() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.52. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to truncate the scan table.
