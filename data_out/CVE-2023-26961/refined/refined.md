Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Alteryx application's media management feature, which allows an administrator to upload a file with an arbitrary file type, rather than a valid one. This lack of input validation on the 'type' field of a media file allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation on the 'type' field when updating media files.
- Inadequate handling of user-supplied content in the media management feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the application, or other malicious activities.
- The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the media management feature of the Alteryx application.
-  An administrator, with the required privileges, crafts a malicious payload in a media file's `type` field and updates the media metadata by sending a PUT request with the malicious payload.
- When another user views the media section and filters by the malicious entry, the injected JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrator-level access to the Alteryx application's management interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate the media management section within the Alteryx platform.
- No specific user interaction is required beyond normal usage of the media filter after the administrator has injected the payload.
