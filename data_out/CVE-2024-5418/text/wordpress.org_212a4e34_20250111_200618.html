Beware! I just updated the DeThemeKit for Elementor plugin from 1.5.9.5 to v2.0.0, and all three De Galleries on my homepage disappeared. Fortunately, I restored my site from a backup, and it’s working again as before. However, I recommend skipping this update if you have legacy galleries.
Update: The developer responded with a revised plugin v2.0.1 that fixed the problem so I changed my rating to five stars.

Have used Detheme themes and plugins on a couple of websites now. Just brilliant. They work straightaway and the support is first rate. Less than 24 hour turnaround on a query about a feature.
I even have a wish list of features and ideas for them!

A simple disaster… Unclean code, no library in the interface and crashes Elementor! I am very unhappy to have opted for a theme that incorporates this extension 🙁
