Beware! I just updated the DeThemeKit for Elementor plugin from 1.5.9.5 to v2.0.0, and all three De Galleries on my homepage disappeared. Fortunately, I restored my site from a backup, and it’s working again as before. However, I recommend skipping this update if you have legacy galleries.
Update: The developer responded with a revised plugin v2.0.1 that fixed the problem so I changed my rating to five stars.

Have used Detheme themes and plugins on a couple of websites now. Just brilliant. They work straightaway and the support is first rate. Less than 24 hour turnaround on a query about a feature.
I even have a wish list of features and ideas for them!

A simple disaster… Unclean code, no library in the interface and crashes Elementor! I am very unhappy to have opted for a theme that incorporates this extension 🙁

| Publicly Published | May 30, 2024 |

### Description

The DethemeKit For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'slitems' attribute within the plugin's De Product Tab & Slide widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
