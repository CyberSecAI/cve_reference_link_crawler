The Image Map Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability check on the AJAX functions in versions up to, and including, 6.0.20. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level privileges or above, to add, update or delete map projects.
