Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Event Calendar widget of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering the Event Calendar, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and executed within the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages containing the vulnerable event calendar widget.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to actions such as:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Information theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious code into the event calendar's settings/attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated attacker with Contributor-level permissions or higher is required to exploit this vulnerability. This is because the ability to manipulate the event calendar and its attributes requires a certain level of access in WordPress.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including version 5.9.9.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 5.9.10 by adding `esc_attr()` for sanitization of the data attributes.
- The provided changelog shows that `esc_attr()` was applied to `data-locale`, `data-defaultview`, `data-defaultdate`, `data-time_format`, `data-hideDetailsLink` and `data-first_day` attributes. Before the fix, the output was unsanitized (`~~$local~~`, `~~$default_view~~`, `~~$default_date~~`, etc.)
