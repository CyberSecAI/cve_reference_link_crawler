Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-36260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The system allows for the execution of arbitrary commands due to insufficient input sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious commands that the system will execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Device compromise:** Attackers can gain access to the devices, potentially leading to full control.
- **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the compromised cameras.
- **Botnet inclusion:** Compromised devices can be used to form a botnet for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- **Lateral movement:** Attackers can potentially use compromised cameras as a stepping stone to further penetrate an organization's network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: The vulnerability can be exploited through network connections to the cameras.
- Publicly available exploits: Several exploits have been made public, making it easier for attackers to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: Attackers need to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Hikvision cameras.
- Knowledge of vulnerability: Attackers need to be aware of the command injection flaw and its method of exploitation.
- Scripting skills: Attackers may use scripting to automate exploitation of multiple vulnerable devices.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10, indicating a critical severity.
- There are reports of Russian cybercriminal forums where hackers are collaborating on exploiting this vulnerability.
- Leaked credentials for Hikvision cameras are reportedly being sold on these forums.
- Over 80,000 Hikvision cameras are estimated to still be vulnerable.
- Vulnerable cameras are located in more than 100 nations and impact over 2,300 organizations.
- Countries with the most vulnerable cameras include China, the U.S., and Vietnam, but several other countries also have significant numbers of affected devices.
- The vendor released a patch in September 2021, but many devices remain unpatched.
- CISA added the bug to its list of known exploited vulnerabilities and ordered federal civilian agencies to patch it.
- Multiple botnets, like Moobot, have been observed leveraging this vulnerability.
- There are claims that Hikvision's product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities, or worse, uses default credentials.
