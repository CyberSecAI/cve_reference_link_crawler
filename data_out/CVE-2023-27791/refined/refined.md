  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2023-27791": {
      "root_cause": "The EasyInstall LAPM solution uses an insecure PRNG seeded with the current time from _time64().",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure PRNG seeding with predictable time value.",
        "Use of rand() function, which is not cryptographically secure.",
        "Password character class checks that could overwrite already generated characters, leading to non-compliant passwords."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can regenerate the local administrator password by knowing the password change time and the algorithm used, gaining unauthorized administrator access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Reverse engineering of the application to understand the password generation algorithm.",
        "Obtaining the 'last password change' time of the administrator account (e.g., via `net user`)."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to reverse engineer the EasyInstall application.",
        "Knowledge of the administrator's last password change time.",
        "Ability to know/guess the password policy (character classes and length)."
