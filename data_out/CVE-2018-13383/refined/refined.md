Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-13383:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly handle JavaScript HREF content when proxying webpages through the SSL VPN web portal. This improper handling leads to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap buffer overflow

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is the potential termination of the SSL VPN web service for logged-in users, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability could potentially allow for remote code execution on the affected FortiProxy or FortiOS device, though the provided information focuses on DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious webpage with specific Javascript HREF content.
- A logged-in, authenticated user needs to visit this specifically crafted proxied webpage through the SSL VPN web portal.
- The vulnerability only affects the SSL VPN web-mode, not the tunnel-mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need to be authenticated to the FortiProxy or FortiOS system, but requires an authenticated user to visit the malicious webpage through the SSL VPN portal.
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and trick an authenticated user into accessing it through the vulnerable SSL VPN portal.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   **FortiProxy:** Version 2.0.0
*   **FortiOS:** Versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.4

**Patched Versions:**

*   **FortiProxy:** Upgrade to version 2.0.1 or above, or 1.2.9 or above.
*  **FortiOS:** Upgrade to FortiOS versions 5.2.15, 5.4.13, 5.6.11, 6.0.5 or 6.2.0 and above.

**Workarounds (FortiOS):**
*   Use SSL VPN tunnel-mode only.
*   Only access trusted HTTP web servers under SSL VPN web-mode.
*   Completely disable the SSL-VPN service.
