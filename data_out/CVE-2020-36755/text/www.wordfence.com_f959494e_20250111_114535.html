### Description

The Customizr theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the czr\_fn\_post\_fields\_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to post fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
