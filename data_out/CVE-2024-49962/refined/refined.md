The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49962.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing null check on the return value of `ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED()` in the `acpi_db_convert_to_package()` function within the ACPI subsystem. The `ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED()` function can fail and return NULL. If this occurs, subsequent dereferences of the returned pointer will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing null check on the return value of `ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED()`
- Potential for NULL pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to NULL pointer dereference

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `acpi_db_convert_to_package()` function in a way that causes `ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED()` to return NULL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to influence the ACPI subsystem in a manner to cause a memory allocation failure in the `ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED` function. Specific requirements are unclear from the provided information and would likely require access to the system.
