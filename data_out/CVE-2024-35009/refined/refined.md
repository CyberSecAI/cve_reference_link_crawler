Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF protection in the `share_switch.php` component of the idccms V1.35 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application fails to implement adequate measures to prevent CSRF attacks. Specifically, the `share_switch.php` endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/share_switch.php?mudi=switch&dataType=&fieldName=state&fieldName2=state&tabName=banner&dataID=6` does not validate the origin of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without the user's knowledge or consent. In this specific case, the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) suggests the attacker could potentially modify the `state` of a banner by submitting the crafted form. While the exact impact of changing the banner state isn't described, it could involve actions such as disabling or enabling a specific element of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form that is hosted on an attacker-controlled site. A user who is authenticated with the vulnerable application visits the attacker-controlled site and is tricked into submitting the form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page containing the crafted form.
- The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable application into accessing the attacker's website.
- The attacker doesn't require access to the user's session data directly; instead, they rely on the user's existing authentication with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates a simple HTML form that, when submitted, sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The specific parameters being used, such as `mudi=switch&dataType=&fieldName=state&fieldName2=state&tabName=banner&dataID=6`, provide the necessary context for the request to modify a banner state.
- The vulnerable target is `http://idccms.com/`, but the PoC uses `http://127.0.0.1:80/` likely for local testing. This highlights the potential for an external user to exploit the issue if the server is reachable.
