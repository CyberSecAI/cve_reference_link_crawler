      "ID": "CVE-2024-30922",
      "Description": "DerbyNet’s document rendering endpoint, specifically within `print/render/award.inc`, is vulnerable to an unauthenticated SQL Injection. This vulnerability is exploitable via the `where` parameter in the URL. The SQL Injection manifests in the code as follows:\n```\n$base_sql = 'SELECT awardid, awardname, awardtype, classid, rankid, racerid '\n  .' FROM '.inner_join('Awards', 'AwardTypes', 'Awards.awardtypeid = AwardTypes.awardtypeid');\n$sql = $base_sql;\nif (($_GET['ids'])) {\n  $sql .= ' WHERE awardid IN ('.$_GET['ids'].',0)';\n} else if (isset($_GET['where'])) {\n  $sql .= ' WHERE '.$_GET['where'];\n}\n```\nThe vulnerability is due to the direct incorporation of the `where` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL query structure and execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or even database structure compromise within the application’s database management system (SQLite3, as indicated).",
