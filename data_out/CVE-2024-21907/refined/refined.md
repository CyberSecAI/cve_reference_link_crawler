{
  "CVE-2024-21907": {
    "Description": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults due to improper handling of StackOverFlow exception (SOE) whenever nested expressions are being processed.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of StackOverflow exceptions when processing deeply nested JSON structures during serialization and deserialization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Defaults: The library does not have a default maximum depth limit when parsing JSON. When serializing or deserializing highly nested JSON objects, a StackOverflowException is thrown, leading to denial of service.",
       "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions: The library fails to gracefully handle StackOverflow exceptions, causing the application process to terminate abruptly."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted JSON object with high nesting levels, leading to application crashes due to StackOverflow exceptions or high CPU/RAM usage.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, involving sending specially crafted JSON payloads to a vulnerable application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction. They only need to be able to send the crafted JSON payload to the affected application."
  }
