[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-5crp-9r3c-p9vr)

## Package

nuget

Newtonsoft.Json
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

< 13.0.1

## Patched versions

13.0.1

## Description

Newtonsoft.Json prior to version 13.0.1 is vulnerable to Insecure Defaults due to improper handling of expressions with high nesting level that lead to StackOverFlow exception or high CPU and RAM usage. Exploiting this vulnerability results in Denial Of Service (DoS).

The serialization and deserialization path have different properties regarding the issue.

Deserializing methods (like `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`) will process the input that results in burning the CPU, allocating memory, and consuming a thread of execution. Quite high nesting level (>10kk, or 9.5MB of `{a:{a:{...` input) is needed to achieve the latency over 10 seconds, depending on the hardware.

Serializing methods (like `JsonConvert.Serialize` or `JObject.ToString`) will throw StackOverFlow exception with the nesting level of around 20k.

To mitigate the issue one either need to update Newtonsoft.Json to 13.0.1 or set `MaxDepth` parameter in the `JsonSerializerSettings`. This can be done globally with the following statement. After that the parsing of the nested input will fail fast with `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException`:

```
JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = () => new JsonSerializerSettings { MaxDepth = 128 };

```

Repro code:

```
//Create a string representation of an highly nested object (JSON serialized)
int nRep = 25000;
string json = string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("{a:", nRep)) + "1" +
 string.Concat(Enumerable.Repeat("}", nRep));

//Parse this object (leads to high CPU/RAM consumption)
var parsedJson = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json);

// Methods below all throw stack overflow with nRep around 20k and higher
// string a = parsedJson.ToString();
// string b = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(parsedJson);

```
### Additional affected product and version information

**The original statement about the problem only affecting IIS applications is misleading.** Any application is affected, however the IIS has a behavior that stops restarting the instance after some time resulting in a harder-to-fix DoS.\*\*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
