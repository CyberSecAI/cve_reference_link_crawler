The provided content relates to CVE-2024-41356.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization/validation of the `$_POST["network"]` parameter within the `app\admin\firewall-zones\zones-edit-network.php` file before it is embedded into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before embedding it within the HTML, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
- The injected script can be executed within the context of other users' browsers who view the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/app/admin/firewall-zones/zones-edit-network.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to include a malicious JavaScript payload within the `$_POST["network"]` array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected application, suggesting they can be an authenticated user or able to somehow send this request to the application.
- No further specific capabilities or privileges are mentioned as a requirement.
