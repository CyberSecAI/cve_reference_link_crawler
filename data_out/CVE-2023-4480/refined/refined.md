- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-date dependency in the "Fusion File Manager" component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file read and limited file write vulnerabilities due to an out-of-date dependency in the "Fusion File Manager" component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read the contents of files on the system accessible within the privileges of the running process. They may also write files to arbitrary locations, provided the files pass the application's mime-type and file extension validation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal payloads to an endpoint within the "Fusion File Manager" component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to log into the admin panel of the application via either an "Administrator" or "Super Administrator" account.
