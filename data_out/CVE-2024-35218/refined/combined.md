([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

>= 8.0.0

## Patched versions

8.18.13, 10.8.4, 12.3.7, 13.1.1

## Description

### Impact

Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) enable attackers that have access to backoffice to bring malicious content into a website or application.

### Affected versions

Umbraco CMS >= 8.00

### Patches

This is fixed in 8.18.13, 10.8.4, 12.3.7, 13.1.1 by implementing IHtmlSanitizer

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-35218
