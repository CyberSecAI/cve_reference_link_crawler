- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected products leak sensitive data in the HTTP Referer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor due to the leakage of sensitive data in the HTTP Referer. This is classified as CWE-200.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N), requires low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges (PR:N), and user interaction (UI:R) is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An unauthenticated remote attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the HTTP Referer if a user interacts with a malicious link or website.
