I am not seeing any memory leak vulnerability.  I do see that tiff2bw
made no attempt to release any memory at all (not strictly required
for a utility since memory is released when it quits).  I have
modified the code in the development CVS version to release memory to
satisfy memory checkers.

This is a memory-based DOS issue within tiff2bw itself (not directly
inside libtiff).  TIFF files using LZW compression can achieve a very
high compression ratio so it can be difficult to predict if a file's
pixel dimensions are bogus or not.  Valid files also pose a DOS
opportunity.  There are no arbitrary limits imposed within tiff2bw.
