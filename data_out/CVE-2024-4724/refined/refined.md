Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `case_type_name` parameter in the `/admin/case-type` page is directly echoed into the HTML without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code.
- The attacker submits the payload through the `case_type_name` parameter in the `/admin/case-type` form via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/admin/case-type` page.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter `case_type_name`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target application's functionality.
