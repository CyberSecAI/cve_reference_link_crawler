SUMMARY

Parasolid is affected by an out of bounds write vulnerability that could be triggered when the application reads files in X\_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
