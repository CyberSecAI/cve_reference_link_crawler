- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write occurs when parsing a specially crafted X_T part file in Parasolid. This write happens past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process if a user opens a malicious X_T file.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted X_T file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious X_T file with a vulnerable version of Parasolid. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges.
