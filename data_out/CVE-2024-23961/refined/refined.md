- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `UPDM_wemCmdUpdFSpeDecomp` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the Alpine Halo9 device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical presence with the device, and no authentication is required.
