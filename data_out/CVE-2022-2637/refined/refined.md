- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Hitachi Storage Plug-in for VMware vCenter. The vulnerability occurs only if Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is being used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a privilege escalation, which allows an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification or other malicious actions. The CVSS score indicates a medium severity with potential impact to integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), and the exploit requires low privileges (PR:L) and a user interaction (UI:R) with high complexity (AC:H)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges on the system, needs some user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, and must have network access. The complexity is considered high.
