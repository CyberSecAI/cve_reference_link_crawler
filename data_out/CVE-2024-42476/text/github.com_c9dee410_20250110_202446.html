# state parameter for authz code and implicit grants is checked using assert. This will be omitted in -d:danger and --assertions:off builds leading to a CSRF vulnerability

Moderate

## Package

oauth
(Nimble)

## Affected versions

< v0.11

## Patched versions

>= v0.11

## Description

## Overview

The Authorization Code grant and Implicit grant both rely on the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF attacks where a resource owner might have their session associated with protected resources belonging to an attacker.

When this project is compiled with certain compiler flags set, it is possible that the `state` parameter will not be checked at all, creating a CSRF vulnerability.

## Details

In `oauth/src/oauth2.nim`, for both of the grants mentioned above, the `state` parameter is checked using an `assert` statement.

See:

[oauth/src/oauth2.nim](https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/blob/b8c163b0d9cfad6d29ce8c1fb394e5f47182ee1c/src/oauth2.nim#L235)

|  | assert params["state"] == state |
| --- | --- |

[oauth/src/oauth2.nim](https://github.com/CORDEA/oauth/blob/b8c163b0d9cfad6d29ce8c1fb394e5f47182ee1c/src/oauth2.nim#L255)

|  | assert params["state"] == state |
| --- | --- |

According to Nim's documentation:

> template [assert](https://nim-lang.org/docs/assertions.html#assert.t%2Cuntyped%2Cstring)(cond: [untyped](https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#untyped); msg = "")
>
> Raises AssertionDefect with msg if cond is false. Note that AssertionDefect is hidden from the effect system, so it doesn't produce {.raises: [AssertionDefect].}. This exception is only supposed to be caught by unit testing frameworks.
>
> No code will be generated for assert when passing -d:danger (implied by --assertions:off). See [command line switches](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#compiler-usage-commandminusline-switches).
>
> **Example:**
>
> assert 1 == 1
>
> **Example: cmd: --assertions:off**
>
> assert 1 == 2 # no code generated, no failure here
>
> **Example: cmd: -d:danger**
>
> assert 1 == 2 # ditto

Given that the exceptions thrown by `assert` statements are only supposed to be caught by unit testing frameworks, compiling this project with `--assertions:off` or `-d:danger` is a reasonable choice for a release build.

However, in these release builds, no code will be generated for the `assert` statements meaning that the `state` parameter will never be checked.

## Recommendation

Check the `state` parameter using a regular `if` statement or `doAssert` instead of relying on a plain `assert`.

`doAssert` will achieve your desired behavior even if `-d:danger` or `--assertions:off` is set.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
