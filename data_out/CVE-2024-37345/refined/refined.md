- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the administrative UI of Absolute Secure Access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject a limited-length script that is then stored and executed when an administrator accesses it.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact to system integrity is high, meaning an attacker can potentially modify system data or behavior through the injected script when an admin views it. There is no loss of confidentiality and no impact on system availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can pass a limited-length script to the administrative UI, this script is then stored on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious script to the administrative interface. The description indicates this can be done from an unauthenticated position. User interaction (an admin viewing the malicious script) is required for the exploit to take effect.
