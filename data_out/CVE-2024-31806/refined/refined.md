  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `RebootSystem` function in the `system.so` file can reboot the system without any authorization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of authorization check before executing the system reboot function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by repeatedly rebooting the device, or simply reboot the device without authorization.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a request to the `RebootSystem` function.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the device's web interface."
