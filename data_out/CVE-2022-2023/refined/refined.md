Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect API endpoint being used in the profile update functionality. The original code was attempting to use `/api/v1/users/:username` for profile updates. This commit changes the endpoint to `/api/v1/profile/` which will correctly utilize the `apiUsers.profileUpdate` function as defined in `src/controllers/api/v1/users.js`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect API Endpoint:** The primary vulnerability was the incorrect API endpoint used in the frontend JavaScript file (`src/public/js/angularjs/controllers/profile.js`). It was attempting to perform a PUT request to `/api/v1/users/:username` which is likely meant for user updates, not profile updates. 
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** Using the wrong endpoint for a profile update could lead to unintended consequences as the backend was not configured to handle profile updates via that route. This could potentially expose user data or allow an attacker to potentially manipulate user data if they were to figure out the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

While the provided information doesn't explicitly state the impact of exploiting the incorrect endpoint, potential impacts could be:

- **Profile Update Failure:**  The user would not be able to update their profile information because the API call would be routed incorrectly.
- **Data Inconsistency:**  If the incorrect endpoint was still functional with limited data it could lead to data inconsistencies by modifying the wrong data.
- **Potential for Unauthorized User Modification:** If the incorrect endpoint was not correctly secured it could be possible for an attacker to modify another users profile.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Manipulation:** An attacker could directly send a PUT request to the incorrect endpoint `/api/v1/users/:username` with malicious data, this would only work if the backend was not configured correctly.
- **Frontend Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the JavaScript code of the front-end to call the incorrect endpoint with malicious data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** An attacker would need to understand how the API is structured, or be able to inspect the front end to understand which API endpoint is being called.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP requests to the server.
- **Access to the application:** The attacker would need access to the application or its front end.

**Additional Details:**

- The commit also includes changes in `src/controllers/api/v1/users.js` to properly handle the `/api/v1/profile/` update request.
-  The fix includes checks to ensure the user exists and if the password is being updated the password complexity is checked.
- The commit also includes a change to correctly pass the data to the new API endpoint `/api/v1/profile/`.
