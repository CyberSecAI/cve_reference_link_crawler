- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read access when uncompressing certain data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). The usage of `sun.misc.Unsafe` bypasses additional bounds checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a JVM crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing specially crafted, untrusted compressed data to be uncompressed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide data to be uncompressed by the vulnerable library.
