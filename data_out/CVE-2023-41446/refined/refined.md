Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `AjaxNewsTicker` component of phpkobo. Specifically, the `title` parameter when creating new news entries is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it doesn't sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the `title` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This allows an attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or defacing the website content. The provided example payload is `onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)`, which demonstrates the ability to access sensitive data such as cookies.
*   **Account Hijacking:** If the website uses cookies for authentication, attackers can potentially gain control of user accounts by stealing their cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker creates a malicious link containing the crafted payload which they send to the victim. The payload is then executed when the victim clicks on the link, and the page with the malicious news is loaded.
*   **Admin Panel Interaction:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the admin panel of the `AjaxNewsTicker` component and injecting the payload into the "title" field when creating news entries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `AjaxNewsTicker` admin panel.
*   **Craft Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JavaScript payload to inject into the vulnerable title field.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious link containing the created payload.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** phpkobo `AjaxNewsTicker` version 1.05.
*   **Payload Example:** `onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)`
*   **Exploitation Methods:** The PoC demonstrates both `POST` and `GET` request methods for injecting the malicious payload. The parameter is injected using a `requ` parameter containing a JSON object with the malicious title.
*   **Steps to reproduce:** The steps to reproduce are well defined in the report.
