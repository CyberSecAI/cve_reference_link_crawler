- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `extend` function in the `2o3t-utility` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `extend` function allows modification of the `Object.prototype` by using the `__proto__` property in the input, leading to prototype pollution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify built-in object prototypes. This can lead to Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution or Cross-Site Scripting attacks depending on how the application logic is affected.
- **Attack vectors:** By calling the vulnerable `extend` function with an argument that contains the `__proto__` property, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `extend` function with a crafted input.
