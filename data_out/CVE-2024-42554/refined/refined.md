Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Hotel Management System is vulnerable to SQL Injection in the `admin_room_added.php` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of user-supplied input within the SQL queries, specifically the 'rooms' and 'noofrooms' parameters in the POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user input before it's used in constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The document indicates "Impact Escalation of Privileges: true", meaning a successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to administrative control over the system's database and application.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information stored in the database (user data, room information, etc.).
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- **System Compromise:** If database access is compromised an attacker could potentially use this as a pivot to further compromise the server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/admin_room_added.php` with malicious SQL code injected in the `rooms` and/or `noofrooms` parameters of the request body.
- **Form Data:** The request is sent as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` making it easy to formulate the attack request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server where the Hotel Management System is hosted.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests, POST requests, and the structure of form data.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a payload that exploits the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof of concept does not indicate that an attacker would need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability. However further testing would be needed to verify this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command (`python sqlmap.py -r C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\1.txt --batch --banner --flush-session`) and the `1.txt` request file serves as a Proof-of-Concept and shows how a tool like `sqlmap` can be used to automatically test and exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code is within the commit range `commit<=91caab8e505a1791780594d23408fb31fcc272cc` of the Hotel-Management-System GitHub repository: `https://github.com/vaibhavverma9999/Hotel-Management-System`.

This analysis provides a good understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability, its potential impact, attack vectors and necessary preconditions for exploitation.
