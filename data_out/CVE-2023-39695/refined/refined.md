Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient session expiration in the Elenos ETG150 FM transmitter web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Session Invalidation:** The application does not properly invalidate the user's session upon logout. This allows an attacker to reuse the session even after the legitimate user has logged out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains a valid session token can gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
*   **Configuration Changes:** The attacker can change the transmitter configurations and data, even after the legitimate user has logged out, due to the session not being invalidated
*   **Persistence:** The attacker can persist in the user's account as the session remains active until it is explicitly invalidated by the system/timeout.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could obtain a valid user's session through techniques like:
    *   Network sniffing (if communication isn't encrypted).
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if present in the web application.
    *   Social engineering to trick a user into revealing their session ID.
    *   Malware on the user's computer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Valid Session:** The attacker needs to have obtained a valid session of a legitimate user.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Elenos ETG150 FM transmitter's web interface.

**Technical Details from POC:**

1.  **Initial Access:** The attacker logs into the web interface using a legitimate admin account.
2.  **Intercept Session:** Using a proxy, the attacker intercepts a request (in this case, a preference save request) and obtains the session token or cookies.
3.  **Logout:** The legitimate user logs out of the web interface.
4.  **Session Reuse:**  The attacker replays the captured request, modifying the data (e.g., changing temperature units and format number), and the change is applied even after the user has logged out.
5.  **Confirmation:** The legitimate user logs back in and notices that changes performed by attacker were applied.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The described vulnerability affects Elenos ETG150 FM transmitter version 3.12.
*   The provided information gives a clear understanding of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited, beyond just a basic description.
