```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (regex) used in `lib/gitlab/front_matter.rb` for parsing front matter in user inputs like notes and issues. The regex pattern `\\s* ... \\s* ... \\s*`  exhibits cubic complexity, leading to excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service)",
    "Unbounded computation due to inefficient regex"
   ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting crafted input that triggers the vulnerable regex, leading to high CPU usage and potentially making the GitLab instance unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting crafted text through any user-facing feature that uses the vulnerable front matter parsing regex, such as issue descriptions, notes, or comments. Specifically, an attacker can create content with multiple lines of whitespace followed by a delimiter, which causes the regex engine to backtrack and consume significant resources.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit text input to GitLab through a user account. This does not require any elevated privileges. The attacker could be a normal user of the application."
