{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient user input validation for the `customer` parameter in the `ssms.php` file. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of prepared statements"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, access sensitive information, potentially leading to complete system control and service interruption.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "location": "The 'customer' parameter in a POST request to `ssms.php`",
      "method": "Sending a crafted POST request containing SQL injection payload in the `customer` parameter"
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `ssms.php` file. No authentication is explicitly required to exploit the vulnerability."
