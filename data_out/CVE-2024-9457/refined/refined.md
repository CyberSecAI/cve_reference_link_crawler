*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the WP Builder plugin when handling SVG file uploads. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG file uploads, allowing an attacker to embed malicious scripts within these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:**  When a user accesses an SVG file containing malicious code, the embedded script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
