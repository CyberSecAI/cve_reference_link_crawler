The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in the ANET system, and one of them is related to CVE-2024-38447.

**CVE-2024-38447: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ANET system does not properly check user authorization when accessing reports via their unique IDs.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, specifically an authorization bypass due to the system's reliance on user-provided keys without proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker (a user of the system) can gain unauthorized access to draft reports created by other users by directly accessing the report's URL using the report ID, even if that report should not be visible to them.
*   **Attack vectors:** Direct access via a crafted URL, where the attacker uses the known or guessed ID of another user's draft report.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any authenticated user of the ANET system can exploit this vulnerability if they know a valid report ID.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The ANET system allows users to create engagement reports that can be saved as drafts. These reports have unique IDs. The system fails to verify if the user accessing a report via the URL is authorized to do so, allowing an attacker to access another user's draft report if they know the report's ID.
