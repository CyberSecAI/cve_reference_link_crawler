The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs due to a missing share check in the veth driver when GRO (Generic Receive Offload) is enabled on a veth device and TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) is disabled on the peer device.  This allows shared/cloned skbs (socket buffers) to enter the GRO engine, leading to a kernel BUG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing share check for skbs in the veth driver when GRO is enabled and TSO is disabled.
-  The veth code doesn't verify if an skb is cloned/shared before passing it to the GRO engine.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic (BUG) and denial of service. The specific kernel BUG is a result of the `skb_shift` function being called with a shared/cloned skb.
- System instability

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering network traffic through a veth interface with GRO enabled and TSO disabled on the peer device
- Sending TCP packets through this configuration

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network traffic through a veth interface
- Needs to be able to set up veth interfaces with GRO enabled and TSO disabled on the peer device.
