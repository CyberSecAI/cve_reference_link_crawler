# RAR, UnRAR: Arbitrary File Overwrite — GLSA **202309-04**

An arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability has been discovered in RAR and UnRAR, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/rar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.23** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.23** |

| Package | **app-arch/unrar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.10** |

### Background

RAR and UnRAR provide command line interfaces for compressing and decompressing RAR files.

### Description

Due to an error in the validation of symbolic links within archives, RAR and UnRAR can potentially write files to a directory which is outside of the intended unpack directory.

### Impact

If the user running RAR or UnRAR extracts a malicious archive, the archive could overwrite a file such as the user's shell initialization scripts, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of that user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RAR users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/rar-6.23"

```

All UnRAR users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unrar-6.2.10"

```
