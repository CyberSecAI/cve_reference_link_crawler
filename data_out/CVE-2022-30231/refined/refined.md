- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software discloses password hashes of other users upon request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Transmission of private resources (password hashes) into a new sphere, leading to a resource leak (CWE-402).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can retrieve password hashes of other users. This could potentially be used for further attacks, such as offline password cracking, to gain unauthorized access to other user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
