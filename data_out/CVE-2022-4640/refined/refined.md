  "CVE-2022-4640": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not perform proper input sanitization on user-provided data when saving or updating articles. Specifically, the `net.mingsoft.cms.action#save()` and `net.mingsoft.cms.action#update()` methods do not filter data submitted by the user.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into article fields like title, description, and content, leading to XSS attacks when a user views the affected article. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.",
       "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious payload (containing JavaScript code) within the article fields during content creation or update.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to save or update articles in the CMS.  This would likely require a valid user account with appropriate permissions."
