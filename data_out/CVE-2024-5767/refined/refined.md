  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF protection in some areas and does not sanitize or escape user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers the vulnerable code, injecting a stored XSS payload. This requires the administrator to click the crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into visiting a crafted URL. No prior authentication is required for the attacker."
