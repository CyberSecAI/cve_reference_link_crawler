Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `get_posts` REST API endpoint within the "Post Grid Combo â€“ 36+ Gutenberg Blocks" WordPress plugin. This endpoint lacks proper access control, allowing unauthenticated users to make data queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information through the `get_posts` endpoint.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The REST API endpoint fails to restrict access based on user authentication or authorization, making it publicly accessible.
- **Lack of Sanitization/Filtering:** The vulnerability allows retrieval of data that should be protected, including full draft posts and password-protected posts (and even the passwords), indicating insufficient filtering of post content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can access sensitive and private information, such as unpublished drafts, privileged content, and user credentials (passwords for protected posts).
- **Data Leakage:** The exposure of post content, including metadata, can lead to significant data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Unauthenticated REST API Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint `/post-grid/v2/get_posts`. This can be achieved without any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Special Access Required:**  The attacker does not require any user account or elevated permissions on the target WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the target WordPress site to make requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint.
