In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: nci: Bounds check struct nfc_target arrays

While running under CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, syzkaller reported:

  memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 129) of single field "target->sensf_res" at net/nfc/nci/ntf.c:260 (size 18)

This appears to be a legitimate lack of bounds checking in
nci_add_new_protocol(). Add the missing checks.
