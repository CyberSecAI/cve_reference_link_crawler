Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1812

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the Everest Forms plugin, caused by the improper handling of the `font_url` parameter. This parameter allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The plugin doesn't properly validate or sanitize the `font_url` parameter, allowing it to be used to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
- Lack of Authentication: The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication, meaning anyone can trigger it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An unauthenticated attacker can make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the server hosting the WordPress instance.
-  This can be used to query and modify information from internal services, which are not normally accessible from outside the server's network.
-  The impact includes potential information disclosure, modification of internal data, and further attacks against internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `font_url` parameter in a request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- This parameter is exposed and can be manipulated by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication or special access to exploit this vulnerability, just the ability to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable plugin is Everest Forms, versions 2.0.7 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.8.
- The Wordfence article mentions that the `font_url` parameter is the vulnerable point.
- The provided trac link shows the changeset for the 2.0.8 update which indicates that this was the fix.
