Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities were identiﬁed in the webserver of the SICAM GridEdge application which includes
missing authentication for critical API functions, absent cross-origin resource sharing restrictions and
access to credentials.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM GridEdge enables your existing IEC61850 equipment with IoT functionality using just a few clicks.
Based on international standards (MQTT, OPC UA Pub/Sub (IEC 62451), IEC61850) data collected
from your equipment is transmitted to well-known cloud platforms Siemens MindSphere, Microsoft Azure
and to self-hosted platforms. SICAM GridEdge creates a multi-layered communication architecture,
where the substation IEDs are capable of ingesting local huge data streams and only transmit relevant
pre-processed data into the cloud.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-30228

The affected software does not apply cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) restrictions for critical
operations. In case an attacker tricks a legitimate user into accessing a special resource a malicious
request could be executed.
