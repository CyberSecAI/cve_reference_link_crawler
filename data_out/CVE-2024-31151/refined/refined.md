- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LevelOne WBR-6012 router has an undocumented "user" account with the hard-coded password "AriesSerenaCairryNativitaMegan".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Hard-coded user credentials
    - Lack of functionality to remove or modify the user or their credentials
    - Password length restriction bypassable using browser developer tools or direct requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful authentication using the hard-coded credentials grants the attacker user-level privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via the web application by using the hardcoded username/password to authenticate. The default password restriction of 9 characters in the web interface can be bypassed using browser developer tools or a direct authentication request outside the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the router. They can achieve this if on the same network or via a vulnerable port forward.
