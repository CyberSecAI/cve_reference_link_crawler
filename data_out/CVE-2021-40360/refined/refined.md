- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password hash of a local user account on the remote server can be accessed via a public API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (password hash) via a public API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the password hash and use it for brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access to the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. The vulnerability is accessible via a public API, likely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated attacker with access to the affected system.
