# RHSA-2024:9571 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Streams for Apache Kafka 2.8.0 release and security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Streams for Apache Kafka 2.8.0 is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Streams for Apache Kafka, based on the Apache Kafka project, offers a distributed
backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with
extremely high throughput and extremely low latency.

This release of Red Hat AMQ Streams 2.8.0 serves as a replacement for Red Hat
AMQ Streams 2.7.0, and includes security and bug fixes, and enhancements.

Security Fix(es):

* Zookeeper, Kafka, Cruise Control: org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-server: Jetty ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote() vulnerable to remote DoS attacks [amq-st-2]

"(CVE-2024-8184)"

* Zookeeper, Kafka : org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-servlets: Jetty DOS vulnerability on DosFilter [amq-st-2] "(CVE-2024-9823)"
* Zookeeper, Kafka, Drain Cleaner, Cruise Control: Apache Commons IO: Possible denial of service attack on untrusted input to XmlStreamReader "(CVE-2024-47554)"
* Kafka: (com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java@3.23.4). Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users "(CVE-2024-7254)"

"Drain Cleaner: Awaiting Analysis(CVE-2024-29025)"

* Kroxylicoius: When establishing the connection with the upstream Kafka server using a TLS secured connection, Kroxylicious fails to properly verify the server's hostname, resulting in an insecure connection. For a successful attack to be performed, the attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise any external systems, such as DNS or network routing configuration. "(CVE-2024-8285)"
