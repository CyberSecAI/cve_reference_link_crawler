WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• For CVE-2022-28329: Deactivate the RemoteCapture feature if not required. This feature is

deactivated by default

• For CVE-2022-28329: Restrict network access to the RemoteCapture feature to trusted communi-

cation partners

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the
operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-27481

Affected devices do not properly handle resources of ARP requests. This could allow an attacker to
cause a race condition that leads to a crash of the entire device.

Improper Synchronization (‘Race Condition’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-28328

Affected devices do not properly handle malformed Multicast LLC frames. This could allow an attacker
to trigger a denial of service condition.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-28329

Affected devices do not properly handle malformed TCP packets received over the RemoteCapture
feature. This could allow an attacker to lead to a denial of service condition which only affects the port
used by the RemoteCapture feature.
