It’s a good plugin, but nothing new is coming. Nothing in the roadmap changes. You can’t even add ideas in the roadmap anymore.
There need to be a button in the plugin that you can click, so customers can’t order online for ex. 30 minutes. This when it is too busy in the store.A food ordering menu style without images would also be nice. ex: https://smak-in.be/bestellen/And much more good ideas in the roadmap.

I have a directory and I think this plugin might be perfect for the table logic I need.

Don’t get me wrong, the plugin is cool and does what it says. However, it still feels lacking. It is as if there are no new features that make it stand out from the rest of the plugins inside WordPress. It feels generic with limited compatibility with other plugins.

### Description

The WPCafe – Online Food Ordering, Restaurant Menu, Delivery, and Reservations for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Reservation Form shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.24 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
