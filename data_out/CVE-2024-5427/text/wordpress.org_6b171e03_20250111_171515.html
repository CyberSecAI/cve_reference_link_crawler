It’s a good plugin, but nothing new is coming. Nothing in the roadmap changes. You can’t even add ideas in the roadmap anymore.
There need to be a button in the plugin that you can click, so customers can’t order online for ex. 30 minutes. This when it is too busy in the store.A food ordering menu style without images would also be nice. ex: https://smak-in.be/bestellen/And much more good ideas in the roadmap.

I have a directory and I think this plugin might be perfect for the table logic I need.
