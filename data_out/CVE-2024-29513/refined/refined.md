{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The briscKernelDriver.sys driver uses `IoCreateDevice` instead of `WdmlibIoCreateDeviceSecure` or `IoCreateDeviceSecure` to create a device object, which results in overly permissive access control.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Overly permissive access control to the device object `\\.\BriscKernel`, allowing the `Everyone` group to write to it."
      ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged user can interact with the driver, potentially leading to arbitrary memory operations or denial-of-service (kernel bugcheck).",
      "attack_vectors": "An unprivileged user can send crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device object.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an unprivileged user on the system."

      "root_cause": "The briscKernelDriver.sys driver is shipped with an expired code signing certificate.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Expired code signing certificate."

      "impact": "Users need to disable driver signature enforcement to load the driver.",

    {
      "root_cause": "Sending unexpected data to the 0x222028 IOCTL will dereference a NULL pointer within the driver's code, which is exploitable by unprivileged users.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "NULL pointer dereference vulnerability."
        ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged user can trigger a denial-of-service condition (kernel bugcheck).",
      "attack_vectors": "An unprivileged user can send a crafted IOCTL request (0x222028) with incorrect data to the driver.",
