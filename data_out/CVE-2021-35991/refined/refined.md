- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Input Validation
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly validate input, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the attacker to have local access to the system. The user must be tricked into opening a malicious file (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and has to trick the user into opening a specially crafted malicious file.
