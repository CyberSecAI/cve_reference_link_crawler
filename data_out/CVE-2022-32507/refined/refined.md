**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access controls in the BLE Nuki API.
- Allows sending of high-privilege commands to the Keyturner without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send high-privilege commands to the Keyturner without being authorized.
- Could lead to unauthorized control of the smart lock.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs via the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface.
- Requires sending specifically crafted BLE commands to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the Nuki Smart Lock 3.0.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is specific to Nuki Smart Lock 3.0.
- The vulnerability is related to access control and not a memory corruption issue, such as a buffer overflow.
