Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Apache Solr's Streaming Expressions handle the "zkHost" parameter. When a SolrCloud setup uses ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, these credentials are sent to the server specified in the "zkHost" parameter. This design allows an attacker to potentially intercept these credentials by providing a malicious "zkHost".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The core vulnerability is the exposure of ZooKeeper credentials (including ACLs) to an unauthorized third party.
- **Lack of Validation:** The vulnerability exists because Solr does not sufficiently validate or restrict the destination of ZooKeeper credentials when using Streaming Expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can intercept ZooKeeper credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the SolrCloud's ZooKeeper instance. This would compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the entire cluster. The attacker can use those credential to modify data, reconfigure, or even take control of the cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious "zkHost" Parameter:** The attack vector is through the "zkHost" parameter within the Solr Streaming Expressions. By crafting a streaming expression with a malicious "zkHost" pointing to an attacker-controlled server, they can capture the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send streaming expressions to a vulnerable Apache Solr instance. This is typically through the "/streaming" handler, which requires "read" permissions
- The attacker also needs to have a server that can mimic the ZooKeeper protocol in order to receive the leaked credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache Solr versions 6.0.0 through 8.11.2 and 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.
- The fix implemented in versions 8.11.3 and 9.4.1 limits the use of credentials to `zkHost` values that have the same server address, thus preventing credentials from leaking to attacker-controlled server.
- The severity is considered low.
- This issue is tracked as SOLR-17098.
