Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation in the 'mk\_file\_folder\_manager\_shortcode' AJAX action within the File Manager Pro plugin. This allows for unrestricted file uploads and downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin fails to properly validate the type of files being uploaded, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files, including potentially malicious ones.
*   **Unrestricted File Download:**  The plugin allows downloading arbitrary backup files which could contain sensitive data.
*   **Missing File Type Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper file type validation, which leads to both the upload and download vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Data Breach:** Downloading backup files could expose sensitive data stored within the backup.
*   **Full Compromise:** Successful RCE could lead to full compromise of the affected WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, utilizing HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerable AJAX action.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if an administrator has enabled the file manager functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable AJAX Action:** The attacker needs to know the name and how to interact with the `mk_file_folder_manager_shortcode` AJAX action.
*   **File Manager Access:** The attacker can only exploit this vulnerability if an administrator has granted access to the File Manager module.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects File Manager Pro plugin versions up to and including 8.3.9.
* The vulnerability was discovered by TANG Cheuk Hei (siunam)
* The vulnerability is patched in version 8.3.10.
