## Testimonials

##### Hear from the File Manager community!

This plug-in is a great tool for administrators that need control over the pages, style-sheets and
JavaScript that make up a site. Easy to use, the interface is intuitive.

![](https://filemanagerpro.io/wp-content/themes/webdesi9_fm/images/ba3.png)
#### txsanmh

Easy to use

I’ve always struggled using SSH and Nano to manage and edit my files. Now I can do that easily on the
WordPress panel.

![](https://filemanagerpro.io/wp-content/themes/webdesi9_fm/images/c31.png)
#### crumb72

Excellent plugin

Do you recognise this scenario?

Uploading (zip)files, extracting them in DirectAdmin and then going back to WordPress to enable the component…

![](https://filemanagerpro.io/wp-content/themes/webdesi9_fm/images/373.png)
#### pcdokterbreda

Saves a lot of time

This saves time if I need to check a file. Instead of logging into my host account then cPanel I
can use this. Nice features too.

![](https://filemanagerpro.io/wp-content/themes/webdesi9_fm/images/ae2.png)
#### mfuller526

Easy file access

This is an amazing plugin for maintenance or manual file management. It saves a lot of time
browsing through FTP folders and it is very easy to use!

#### K0NSTANTIN

Very satisfied

I use the free version. Its a high quality plugin, to use very simple. Updates come very quickly.
Can be sure, it does what it shell do.

### Description

The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary backup file downloads and uploads due to missing file type validation via the 'mk\_file\_folder\_manager\_shortcode' ajax action in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, if granted access to the File Manager by an administrator, to download and upload arbitrary backup files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
