- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string (username parameter) before using it in a system call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability via the /usr/bin/pppd endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device, which must be configured to use a PPTP VPN with LDAP authentication. Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.
