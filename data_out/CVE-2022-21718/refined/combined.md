# Renderers can obtain access to random bluetooth device without permission

Low

[MarshallOfSound](/MarshallOfSound)
published
GHSA-3p22-ghq8-v749
Mar 21, 2022

## Package

npm

electron
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 13.6.6 || >=14.0.0-beta.1 < 14.2.4 || >=15.0.0-beta.1 <15.3.5 || >=16.0.0-beta.1 <16.0.6 || >=17.0.0-alpha.1 <17.0.0-alpha.6

## Patched versions

13.6.6, 14.2.4, 15.3.5, 16.0.6, 17.0.0-alpha.6

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows renderers to obtain access to a random bluetooth device via the [web bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler. The device that is accessed is random and the attacker would have no way of selecting a specific device.

All current stable versions of Electron are affected.

### Patches

This has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:

* `17.0.0-alpha.6`
* `16.0.6`
* `15.3.5`
* `14.2.4`
* `13.6.6`

### Workarounds

Adding this code to your app can workaround the issue.

```
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, webContents) => {
  webContents.on('select-bluetooth-device', (event, devices, callback) => {
    // Prevent default behavior
    event.preventDefault();
    // Cancel the request
    callback('');
  });
});
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
