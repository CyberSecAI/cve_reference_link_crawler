- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate sanitization of SSID names within the `wlscanresults.html` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `wlscanresults.html` page. This would potentially allow them to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser when they visit the page.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code within an SSID name, an attacker can manipulate the output of the `wlscanresults.html` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to broadcast an SSID name containing malicious code within range of a vulnerable Humax HGB10R-02 BRGCAB router, version 1.0.03. When a user accesses the router's web interface to view the scan results, the malicious code will be executed.
