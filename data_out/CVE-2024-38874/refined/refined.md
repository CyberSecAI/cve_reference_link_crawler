  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-38874",
      "root_cause": "The extension \"Events 2\" (events2) has multiple vulnerabilities due to incorrect cache configuration, missing access checks, and improper user input sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cache Poisoning: Wrong cache configuration leads to caching of sensitive event data, potentially exposing it to unauthorized users.",
        "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): Missing access checks allow unauthenticated users to activate or delete events.",
        "SQL wildcard injection: Improperly escaped user input in LIKE comparison can lead to SQL injection."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can:\n\n*   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive event data through cache poisoning.\n*   Activate or delete events without proper authentication, potentially disrupting services.\n*   Perform SQL wildcard injection attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the vulnerable web application.",
         "By sending crafted requests to the application, either as an unauthenticated user or as a user with limited privileges."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web application with a vulnerable version of the extension installed. For the IDOR vulnerability they do not need to authenticate. For cache poisoning they can be an authenticated user, and for SQL injection they need to be able to provide user input."
