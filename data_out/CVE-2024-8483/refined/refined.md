Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `static_content()` function in the MAS Static Content plugin did not properly check user permissions before displaying content from a static content post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin failed to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to view a private static content post before displaying its content.
*   **Information Exposure:** Private static content, which should only be visible to authorized users, could be accessed by users with contributor-level access or higher.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers with contributor-level access or higher could view the content of private static content pages that they should not have access to. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** By using the `mas_static_content` shortcode with the ID of a private static content post, an attacker can view its content.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable by any authenticated user with "contributor" level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
*   **User Role:** The attacker must have at least "contributor" level access or higher.
*   **Knowledge of Static Content ID:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) the ID of the private static content post they want to access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.9 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin used `get_post()` to retrieve the static content post without any authorization checks on the post status.
*   The fix adds a check using `get_post_status()` and `current_user_can('read_private_posts')` to ensure the user is authorized to read the content before displaying it.
