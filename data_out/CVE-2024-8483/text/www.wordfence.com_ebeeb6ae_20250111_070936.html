### Description

The MAS Static Content plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8 via the static\_content() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to extract potentially sensitive information from private static content pages.
