- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Post State Tags plugin <= 2.0.6 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to perform unintended actions by leveraging the existing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin and trick an authenticated user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to interact with the malicious request. No prior authentication is needed.
