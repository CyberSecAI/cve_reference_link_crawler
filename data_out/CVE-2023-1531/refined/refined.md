  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-1531",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the ANGLE graphics library, which is used by Google Chrome. Specifically, it occurs in the `Image11::disassociateStorage()` function due to a race condition related to the release of a texture storage object and the subsequent access of the same object.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the browser and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted web page loaded in Google Chrome.",
          "The attacker needs to create a webpage that calls a sequence of WebGL API calls that triggers the vulnerability."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page.",
          "The web page needs to include WebGL API calls to trigger the vulnerability"
      ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs in the ANGLE library's `Image11::disassociateStorage()` function, which is called after a texture storage has been released, due to the mEGLImageTarget argument.  The vulnerability can be triggered by calling `TextureD3D_2D::copySubTexture` which in turn will call `commitRegion` which will finally call `copyToStorage`. `copyToStorage` will set a flag `mRecoverFromStorage` which then makes a call to `mAssociatedStorage->disassociateImage` in `Image11::disassociateStorage()`. This then leads to a use-after-free when mAssociatedStorage is already released."
