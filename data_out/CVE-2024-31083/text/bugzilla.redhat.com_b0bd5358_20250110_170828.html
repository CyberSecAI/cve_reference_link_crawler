Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2272000#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2024-03-28 04:27:05 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in xorg-server and xwayland. ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function calls the AllocateGlyph() function to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server.  AllocateGlyph() would return a new glyph with refcount=0 and a re-used glyph would end up not changing the refcount at all. The resulting glyph_new array would thus have multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs.  ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, resulting in a use-after-free when the same glyph pointer is then later used.  Introduced in: prior to X11R6.7 (2004)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2272000#c3)  Sandipan Roy    2024-04-04 07:49:35 UTC  ``` Created tigervnc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all
