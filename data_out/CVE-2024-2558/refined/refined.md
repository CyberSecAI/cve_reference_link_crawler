Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formexeCommand` function of the Tenda AC18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `formexeCommand` function in the `/goform/execCommand` file receives a `cmdinput` parameter from a POST request. This input is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack (512 bytes) using `strcpy`.  Since the size of the input is not checked, a user-controlled `cmdinput` larger than the allocated buffer leads to a buffer overflow.
- The code uses `strcpy`, which is inherently unsafe when copying user-controlled data into a fixed-size buffer.
- Lack of input validation on the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The stack-based buffer overflow can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues.
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The device may become unstable, crash, or allow for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/execCommand`, with a large `cmdinput` parameter.
- The attack is initiated remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC18 router.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required, however this might be needed for a more complete attack.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/execCommand` and the `cmdinput` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the size of the `cmdinput` parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Tenda AC18 firmware version V15.03.05.05.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
- The vendor was contacted about the vulnerability but did not respond.
- There are no known countermeasures besides replacing the affected device.
- The vulnerability is declared as easy to exploit
- This vulnerability is similar to VDB-261321, VDB-261323, VDB-261331 and VDB-261363
