  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing input validation in the wifi driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation leading to a system crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote denial of service. A successful exploit leads to a system crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "A proximal attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a proximal network position and send malicious network traffic to the target device. No specific user interaction is required."
