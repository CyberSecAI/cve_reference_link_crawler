Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-21532.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ggit` npm package is vulnerable to command injection due to the way the `fetchTags(branch)` API handles user input. The `branch` parameter is concatenated into a git command string without proper sanitization. This command string is then passed to the `exec()` function in Node.js.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: User-controlled input is incorporated into a shell command without proper sanitization.
- Use of `exec()`: The Node.js `exec()` function executes a shell command, which can be dangerous if user input is not properly sanitized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the vulnerable `ggit` library is used. This can lead to a variety of impacts, including:
    - Data exfiltration
    - System compromise
    - Denial of service
    - Installation of malware

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing malicious input to the `fetchTags(branch)` function via a network request or any other means that allows control over the `branch` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input provided to the `fetchTags(branch)` function.
- No privileges are needed, the attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The affected version is `ggit@2.4.12` and earlier versions.
- There is no fixed version of the `ggit` package.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating the vulnerability.
- CVSS v3.1 score is provided: 6.9 (Medium)
