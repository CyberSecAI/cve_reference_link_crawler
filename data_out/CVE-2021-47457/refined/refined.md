Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-47457.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of result check for `wait_event_interruptible()` in `isotp_sendmsg()`. This function is used to wait for the complete transmission of a Protocol Data Unit (PDU). If `wait_event_interruptible()` is interrupted, it can return an error, but the code doesn't check this return value, causing the program to proceed with the interrupted transmission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing error handling: The code doesn't check the return value of `wait_event_interruptible()`.
- Race condition: Multiple accesses to the TX buffer can occur when the wait is interrupted, leading to a race condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data corruption: The vulnerability can lead to multiple accessors for the TX buffer, interfering with the previous process and potentially corrupting data.
- Kernel crash: The syzbot report shows a warning at `isotp_tx_timer_handler` leading to a potential kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an interrupt while waiting for a transmission to complete in the `isotp_sendmsg()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages using the ISO-TP protocol via the CAN interface, and cause the `wait_event_interruptible` to be interrupted.
