Debian Bug     : 1019218

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in SnakeYaml, a YAML
parser for Java, which could facilitate a denial of service attack whenever
maliciously crafted input files are processed by SnakeYaml.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.23-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your snakeyaml packages.

For the detailed security status of snakeyaml please refer to
