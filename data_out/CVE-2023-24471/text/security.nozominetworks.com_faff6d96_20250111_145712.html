## Summary

An access control vulnerability was found, due to the restrictions that are applied on actual assertions not being enforced in their debug functionality.

## Impact

## Affected Products

Guardian, CMC < v22.6.2

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Use internal firewall features to limit access to the web management interface.
