- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from access control restrictions not being properly enforced in the debug functionality of assertions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect authorization (CWE-863) leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user with limited visibility can gain unauthorized access to information via debug functionality. This includes data normally inaccessible through the Query and Assertions functions.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the web management interface by leveraging debug functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires an authenticated user with reduced visibility.
