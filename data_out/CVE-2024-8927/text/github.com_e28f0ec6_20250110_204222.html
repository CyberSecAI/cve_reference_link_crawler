## Description

### Summary

According to <https://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.force-redirect.php>, the configuration directive [`cgi.force_redirect`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.cgi.force-redirect) prevents anyone from calling PHP directly with a URL like `http://host.example/cgi-bin/php/secretdir/script.php`.

The default value of `cgi.force_redirect` is `1`.

But there is a bug that can cause attackers to bypass restrictions and access php-cgi directly.

### Details

Both `REDIRECT_STATUS` or `HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS` are considered legal environment variable while `cgi.force_redirect` is turned on:

<https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c#L1905>

```
	/* check force_cgi after startup, so we have proper output */
	if (cgi && CGIG(force_redirect)) {
		/* Apache will generate REDIRECT_STATUS,
		 * Netscape and redirect.so will generate HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS.
		 * redirect.so and installation instructions available from
		 * http://www.koehntopp.de/php.
		 *   -- kk@netuse.de
		 */
		if (!getenv("REDIRECT_STATUS") &&
			!getenv ("HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS") &&
			/* this is to allow a different env var to be configured
			 * in case some server does something different than above */
			(!CGIG(redirect_status_env) || !getenv(CGIG(redirect_status_env)))
		) {
			zend_try {
				SG(sapi_headers).http_response_code = 400;
				PUTS("<b>Security Alert!</b> The PHP CGI cannot be accessed directly.\n\n\
<p>This PHP CGI binary was compiled with force-cgi-redirect enabled.  This\n\
means that a page will only be served up if the REDIRECT_STATUS CGI variable is\n\
set, e.g. via an Apache Action directive.</p>\n\
<p>For more information as to <i>why</i> this behaviour exists, see the <a href=\"http://php.net/security.cgi-bin\">\
manual page for CGI security</a>.</p>\n\
<p>For more information about changing this behaviour or re-enabling this webserver,\n\
consult the installation file that came with this distribution, or visit \n\
<a href=\"http://php.net/install.windows\">the manual page</a>.</p>\n");
			} zend_catch {
			} zend_end_try();
#if defined(ZTS) && !defined(PHP_DEBUG)
			/* XXX we're crashing here in msvc6 debug builds at
			 * php_message_handler_for_zend:839 because
			 * SG(request_info).path_translated is an invalid pointer.
			 * It still happens even though I set it to null, so something
			 * weird is going on.
			 */
			tsrm_shutdown();
#endif
			free(bindpath);
			return FAILURE;
		}
	}
```

Unexpectedly, `Redirect-Status` header is converted to the `HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS` environment variable, allowing the attacker to bypass the `cgi.force_redirect` variable through HTTP headers.

### Impact

The `cgi.force_redirect` configuration can be bypassed.

While this does not pose significant security risks in most common configurations, certain configurations that modifies the `SCRIPT_FILENAME` environment variable may allow the arbitrary file inclusion.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
