Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `diskusi.php` file of eNdonesia Portal v8.7. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `rid` GET parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability, which arises from the lack of input validation and sanitization for the `rid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database server.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete existing data in the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By using sleep commands, an attacker can potentially cause a denial of service by making the server unresponsive due to prolonged query execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious payload and injecting it into the `rid` GET parameter of an HTTP request.
- **Vulnerable URL:** `/endonesia.8.7.en/mod.php?mod=diskusi&op=delres` is the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQLi:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided proof-of-concept doesn't indicate any need for authentication, thus, the attack may be carried out by unauthenticated users.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof-of-Concept demonstrates the vulnerability using a time-based SQL injection technique via the `sleep()` function. The attacker sends a request with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `rid` parameter:

```
GET /endonesia.8.7.en/mod.php?mod=diskusi&op=delres&rid=(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a) HTTP/1.1
```
The `sleep(20)` command will cause the database to pause execution, resulting in a delay in the response from the server, validating the SQLi vulnerability.
