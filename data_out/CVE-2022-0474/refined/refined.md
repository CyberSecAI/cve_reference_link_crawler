- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the OTRSCustomContactFields module where notification emails were not properly handling individual recipient settings, leading to the disclosure of the full list of recipients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. Specifically, a vulnerability where the email addresses of all recipients in a contact field could be disclosed in notification emails, even when the notification was configured to send to each recipient individually.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially obtain a list of email addresses of customer users, which could be used for malicious purposes, such as spamming or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. The vulnerability is triggered through the sending of notification emails containing a contact field with multiple recipients.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with high privileges in the OTRS system to trigger the notification process. Also, the attacker must have the ability to trigger a notification email that includes a custom contact field. The attacker also needs to have knowledge about the system and its configurations to set up a scenario where this information is disclosed.
