Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from wordfence.com explicitly mentions **CVE-2024-3718** and describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "The Plus Addons for Elementor" plugin, affecting versions up to and including 5.5.4.
   - The content specifically names "Flip Box" along with other widgets as being vulnerable.
   - The provided files from plugins.trac.wordpress.org include the source code of the `tp_flip_box.php` widget.
   - Thus, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**
   - **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within several of the plugin's widgets, including the Flip Box widget.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This could lead to various attacks, including unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking, or phishing.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Malicious code is injected via the plugin's widget settings, typically within a field where user input is expected.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - Authenticated attacker with at least "contributor-level access."
        - Ability to modify widget settings (which a contributor-level user can do).

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**
   - The vulnerabilities are present across multiple widgets within the plugin.
   - The attacker injects the malicious code through the Elementor interface, typically into the form fields of the affected widgets.
   - The injected code is stored in the WordPress database and executed when a user (including administrators) views the affected page.
   - The provided files show the source code of `tp_flip_box.php`, `tp_hovercard.php` `tp_header_extras.php`, `tp_progress_bar.php`, `tp_pricing_table.php` and `tp_age_gate.php` showing specific widgetâ€™s code.

**4. Additional Details:**
    - The Wordfence article indicates that CVE-2024-35709 is likely a duplicate of this issue.
    - A patch is available in version 5.5.5 of the plugin.
    - The issue is present in the following widgets:
        - Progress Bar
        - Header Meta Content
        - Scroll Navigation
        - Pricing Table
        - Flip Box
        - Hover Card
        - Age Gate

**5. Specific to `tp_flip_box.php` and `tp_header_extras.php` :**
    - The code provides the structure for setting various options of the widgets via Elementor controls. It exposes how dynamic data is handled and passed to the front-end.
    - The code itself does not directly show where sanitization issues may arise, but it exposes the entry points where the vulnerability might exist.

**Summary:**

The content reveals a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (CVE-2024-3718) in "The Plus Addons for Elementor" plugin, affecting several widgets (including Flip Box). Authenticated users with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject malicious code by manipulating widget settings. The injected code executes when a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable widget. The issue is resolved in version 5.5.5 of the plugin. The provided files confirm that `tp_flip_box.php`, `tp_hovercard.php` `tp_header_extras.php`, `tp_progress_bar.php`, `tp_pricing_table.php` and `tp_age_gate.php` are part of the vulnerable plugin and contain exploitable code.
