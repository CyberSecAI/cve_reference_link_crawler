- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing Diffie-Hellman (DH) downgrade check during VoWiFi Internet Key Exchange (IKE) negotiation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Selection of less-secure algorithm during negotiation ('algorithm downgrade').
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote information disclosure. An attacker can potentially intercept or decrypt sensitive information transmitted during VoWiFi communication if a weaker algorithm is used.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via the VoWiFi IKE negotiation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not required for exploitation. The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or influence the VoWiFi connection establishment.
