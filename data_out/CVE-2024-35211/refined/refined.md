- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected web server sets the session cookie after successful login without applying security attributes like "Secure", "HttpOnly", or "SameSite".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing security attributes on session cookies. Specifically, the absence of "Secure", "HttpOnly", and "SameSite" flags.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially intercept the session cookie, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. An attacker could potentially intercept the session cookie via network sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks if the "Secure" flag is missing. Without the HttpOnly flag, the cookie can be accessed via scripts, and the missing SameSite attribute could allow CSRF attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to intercept traffic, and the attacker would require a valid user login to have a session cookie to try and exploit.
