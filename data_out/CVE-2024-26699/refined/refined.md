Based on the provided information, both commits address the same vulnerability, which is an array-index-out-of-bounds read in the `dcn35_clk_mgr.c` file. This issue occurs within the `dcn35_clk_mgr_helper_populate_bw_params` function when iterating through clock arrays.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The code iterates through clock arrays (specifically `MemPstateTable`, `FclkClocks_Freq`, and a dcfclk array) using the `NumMemPstatesEnabled`, `NumFclkLevelsEnabled`, and `NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled` fields from a `clock_table` struct, respectively. These fields indicate the number of valid entries in these clock arrays.
- The code assumes that the number of enabled clock levels/states is always within the bounds of maximum array size. However, the code iterates through clock table entries based on the values of the `NumMemPstatesEnabled`, `NumFclkLevelsEnabled`, and `NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled` fields without proper validation against the actual maximum size of those arrays.
- If `NumMemPstatesEnabled`, `NumFclkLevelsEnabled`, or `NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled` is larger than the maximum number of allowed levels, then an out-of-bounds read will occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Array-Index-Out-Of-Bounds Read:**  The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read when iterating through arrays of clock settings if the metadata specifying the number of valid entries is incorrect or maliciously crafted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Access Violation:** Reading beyond the bounds of allocated memory could lead to unpredictable behavior, such as system crashes or read access of sensitive data. It is unclear if arbitrary code execution is possible, but this type of memory read error could potentially be leveraged to gain access to kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious/Corrupted Clock Table Data:** An attacker could try to provide the driver with a crafted `clock_table` where fields such as `NumMemPstatesEnabled`, `NumFclkLevelsEnabled`, or `NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled` have values that are larger than the number of elements in the clock arrays. This could be achieved by modifying the firmware or related configuration settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to control or influence the data within the `clock_table` structure that is passed into the `dcn35_clk_mgr_helper_populate_bw_params` function. This could involve controlling the system firmware, a lower-level driver, or through some other means to inject malicious clock table data.

**Fix:**
The fix limits the iteration based on predefined maximum number of supported levels (`NUM_MEM_PSTATE_LEVELS`, `NUM_FCLK_DPM_LEVELS`, and `NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS`) to prevent accessing memory beyond array bounds:
```c
    num_memps = (clock_table->NumMemPstatesEnabled > NUM_MEM_PSTATE_LEVELS) ? NUM_MEM_PSTATE_LEVELS :
        clock_table->NumMemPstatesEnabled;
    for (i = 0; i < num_memps; i++) {
        ...
    }
    ...
    num_fclk = (clock_table->NumFclkLevelsEnabled > NUM_FCLK_DPM_LEVELS) ? NUM_FCLK_DPM_LEVELS :
        clock_table->NumFclkLevelsEnabled;
    max_fclk = find_max_clk_value(clock_table->FclkClocks_Freq, num_fclk);
    ...
    num_dcfclk = (clock_table->NumFclkLevelsEnabled > NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS) ? NUM_DCFCLK_DPM_LEVELS :
        clock_table->NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled;
    for (i = 0; i < num_dcfclk; i++) {
        ...
    }
```
The fix introduces checks to ensure that iteration does not go beyond the predefined maximums, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read.
