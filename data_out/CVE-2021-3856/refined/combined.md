| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2010164#c0)  Paramvir jindal    2021-10-04 05:21:20 UTC  ``` <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-19422>  <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/master/services/src/main/java/org/keycloak/theme/ClasspathThemeResourceProviderFactory.java>  The ThemeResource resource exposes an endpoint for fetching theme resources:  @GET @Path("/{version}/{themeType}/{themeName}/{path:.*}") public Response getResource(@PathParam("version") String version, @PathParam("themeType") String themType, @PathParam("themeName") String themeName, @PathParam("path") String path) { ... }  The classbased resource loaders are implemented as:  public InputStream getResourceAsStream(String path) {     return classLoader.getResourceAsStream(resourceRoot + path); }  This has no checks for the path parameter, allowing relative traversals like ../.  By sending requests for theme resources with a relative path from an external HTTP client, the client will receive the content of random files if available.  I practice this exposes any files packages within the deployed module, including other resources available as a classloader resource.  Disallowing double dots in the path component is probably the easiest fix   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2010164#c2)  Jonathan Christison    2021-10-04 17:43:36 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:   * Red Hat AMQ Online   Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> and <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5941551> for more details.   ``` |  |
