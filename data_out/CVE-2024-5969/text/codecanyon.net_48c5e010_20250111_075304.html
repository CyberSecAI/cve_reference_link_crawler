## Meet Aiomatic

**The fastest, the best-rated, and the best-selling**, overall the **#1 AI WordPress plugin** to create high quality AI content, edit content using AI, add a chatbot to your site and much more!
## What’s new?

> ##### Last Update on Jan 10, 2025: Aiomatic introduces a new Language Pack Manager under the “Logs & Translations” menu, allowing users to install and manage language packs separately, reducing the plugin’s zip file size. Users can now trigger rules in the “Bulk AI Post Creator” via webhooks and enhance the “AI Content Editor” with advanced internal linking options, specifying allowed or restricted post IDs.

## Join Us In The AI Revolution

### Let me tell you the story of Aiomatic

Introducing Aiomatic, your all-in-one AI-powered WordPress plugin, lovingly crafted and meticulously refined by me (Szabi). Born from a simple idea, Aiomatic has grown into a comprehensive suite of AI tools that can revolutionize your WordPress experience.

In its early days, Aiomatic was a humble AI post generator, capable of creating AI posts using a few straightforward methods. But as I poured my heart and soul into the plugin, it began to evolve, expanding its capabilities far beyond its original design.

Today, Aiomatic is not just a plugin; it’s a powerhouse. It’s a single AI post creator, a bulk AI post creator with multiple content generation methods, and an automatic content editor. It’s a manual bulk content editor, an AI chatbot with different chatbot personas (name, role, avatar), a real time chatbot, which uses voice input and provides voice output to communicate instantly with the users, and a content generator from RSS feeds. It’s also an integrated AI assistant that adds AI-generated content to other plugins.

But that’s not all. Aiomatic is also an AI playground, offering AI fine-tuning, embeddings, AI shortcodes, and a wealth of statistics. It’s an AI SEO tool, providing AI suggestions, usage limitations, usage logs, and graphs. It’s an AI form creator, an AI text moderator, and an AI audio-to-text converter. And it’s always growing, always improving, always evolving.

With Aiomatic, you’re not just getting a plugin. You’re getting a partner, a tool that works tirelessly to make your WordPress experience as seamless and as efficient as possible. You’re getting the result of countless hours of development, refinement, and fine-tuning, all from my part, done with passion, dedication, and commitment to improve this plugin over time, helped by the feedback coming back from my customers.

### Welcome to a new level of AI generated content

The AIomatic plugin will allow you to publish new posts with AI generated or to update old posts with fresh content relevant to the article or post.

You can tell the AI to write negative or positive product reviews, dialogs between different persons, commentaries on events, articles relevant to the title of a specific post and many many more. The limits are beyond your imagination!

Create new engaging content for blog readers or simply spice up older posts with new AI generated content. The choice is yours!

In the latest plugin update, a fully customizable AI chatbot with chatbot personas will also be available to use on the front end or the back end of your site. Check below for details!

### What Can You Do With This Plugin?

**AIomatic** is a breaking edge **AI content writer plugin that is ideal for auto blogging and automatical post publishing or updating**.

It uses [AiomaticAPI’s](https://aiomaticapi.com/), [OpenAI’s](https://openai.com/) or [Microsoft Azure OpenAI’s](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) GPT-4 and newer AI engines to turn your website into a auto blogging or even a money making machine! You can freely select between AiomaticAPI or OpenAI and subscribe to the API of your choice, the plugin will work with both!

As you have the option to set the plugin to work directly with OpenAI API, you will not be required to pay third parties for their services to funnel the content generated by OpenAI’s latest AI models to your site! Using this plugin, you can get the content directly from OpenAI, thus lowering the price of each call, comparative with other similar plugins, which use their own pricing monthly fees, from which they also pay OpenAI in your name, but also withhold their profit.

However, if OpenAI is not working for you, you can subscribe to Microsoft Azure or to AiomaticAPI, which is an API specially created for this plugin, which will also handle AI content creation for you, in the same way as OpenAI would be doing.

**Some of the highlights of the plugin:**

* Embed different chatbots globally on your site for different post categories/custom post types/languages/user agents/operating systems/user roles/device types and many more
* Allow chatbot users to switch between conversations, to start new conversations and to continue older conversations (ChatGPT style)
* Require chatbot users to access the chatbot only after they accepted your GDPR or Privacy Policy notice
* Capture leads from chatbot users, instruct the chatbot to collect user email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses and more
* Combine the power of AI chatbots with trigger based events in the chatbot, allowing you to define hardcoded chatbot message workflows. Triggers and actions are diverse, allowing you to trigger specific messages when the user is logged in, sends specific messages, send messages to specific users and much more.
