Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Quiz And Survey Master plugin fails to properly validate and escape user-supplied data within quiz fields before displaying it on a page or post. Specifically, the answer field of a quiz question is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or encode user inputs, particularly in the quiz answer field, before rendering the content in a webpage.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the database, and executed when the affected page is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed within the browsers of users who view the quiz.
*   **Account Compromise:** If an administrator accesses the page with the injected code, an attacker could potentially take over their account.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information such as session cookies which can be used to impersonate the user.
*   **Defacement:** Redirect to a malicious website.
*   **Other malicious actions:** Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Quiz Creation/Editing:** A user with contributor role or higher can add/edit a question and inject the XSS payload into the answer field.
*   **Quiz Embedding:** When the quiz containing the malicious script is embedded into a post, the XSS payload is triggered whenever any user views or edits the post and interacts with the quiz.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress User Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role.
*   **Quiz Modification Access:** The attacker requires access to create or edit quizzes in the Quiz And Survey Master plugin.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects versions of Quiz And Survey Master prior to 9.0.2, which has a fix.
* The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates that the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>` is successful.
* The CVSS score of 5.9 (medium) indicates the moderate risk of this vulnerability
