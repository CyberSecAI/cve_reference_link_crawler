In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: add refcnt to ksmbd_conn struct

When sending an oplock break request, opinfo->conn is used,
But freed ->conn can be used on multichannel.
This patch add a reference count to the ksmbd_conn struct
so that it can be freed when it is no longer used.
