Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a use-after-free vulnerability in the ksmbd module of the Linux kernel.

- **Root Cause:** The `ksmbd_conn` structure, representing a connection, could be freed while still being referenced during an oplock break request, specifically when multichannel is used. The `opinfo->conn` pointer is used after the connection has been freed.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to missing reference counting for the `ksmbd_conn` structure.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential for a kernel crash or potentially other memory corruption issues, which can lead to denial of service or other impacts.
- **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when sending an oplock break request, which is part of the SMB protocol used for file sharing. An attacker would need to be able to interact with the ksmbd server and trigger an oplock break request on a file, potentially in a multichannel scenario.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would likely need to be a client connected to the ksmbd server, with the ability to trigger oplock break requests.

The provided patches introduce a reference count to the `ksmbd_conn` structure and ensure that it is freed only when the reference count drops to zero, addressing the use-after-free issue.
