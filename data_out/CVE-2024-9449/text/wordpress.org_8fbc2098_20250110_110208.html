## Description

A quick and easy shortcode to embed iframe’s that resize to the content of the remote site.

Auto iFrame shortcode is in the format of:

```
[auto-iframe link=xxx tag=xxx width=xxx height=xxx autosize=yes/no]

```

Where:

* link = the url of the source for the iFrame. REQUIRED.
* tag = a unique identifier in case you want more than one iFrame on a page. Default = auto-iframe.
* width = width of the iFrame (100% by default). Can be % or px. Default = 100%.
* height = the initial height of the iframe (100% by default). Can be % or px. Default = 100%.
* autosize = enable the auto sizing of the iFrame based on the content. The initial height of the iFrame will be set to “height” and then resized. Default = true.
* fudge = a fudge factor to apply when changing the height (integer number, no “px”). Default = 50.
* border = enable the border on the iFrame. Default = 0.
* scroll = enable the scroll bar on the iFrame. Default = no.
* query = pass the parent’s page query string to the iFrame. Default = no.

Note: Auto re-sizing of the iFrame for cross domain sites does not work, this is a security protection provided by the browser and there is no way around it.

Now supports (Shortcode UI)[https://github.com/fusioneng/Shortcake] (aka Shortcake)!

## Screenshots

  Post with short code.

## Installation

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the auto-iframe folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.

## FAQ

### The autosize function doesn’t work, what’s wrong?

The first thing to check is that the source of your content is in the same domain namespace as your site, using a link from another domain name will not work as it would be a cross site scripting risk. This is part of your browsers security structure and cannot be worked around.

After that, check your browsers console for any JavaScript errors that may be happening, there may be conflicting JavaScript on the page causing an error.

This plugin works very fine! Because of caching issues in combination with user restrictions I made a page with 20 iFrames, each loading another small page offering download links. This was the only chance for me to handle it and Auto iFrame made it possible. The resizing of the iFrames works perfectly. Many thanks for this great plugin!

Very misleading description. Does not work with content from “remote sites” ie not on the same domain – As stated by others, and despite what the author may insist, “cross domain” is basically the same as a “remote site”.

I would assume for the non tech people you would supply a simple code where you only enter the link from Google sheets but no. What is this?
[auto-iframe link=xxx tag=xxx width=xxx height=xxx autosize=yes/no]
Says “link=xxx” but how do you insert the link above and where?
Makes this an uninstall and waste of time, give a working sample at least not something we need to figure out

Had to leave a review as I think this plugin deserves more praise and attention.
I’d spent a few hours (hate to count how many exactly) trying to get a few other auto-resize iframe methods working with poor results. It looked like the solution was to simply accept several more hours of work would be needed… I was beginning to lose hope.
Instead, why not search for a WordPress iframe resizer plugin? The result, within 5 minutes I had a perfect auto-resizing iframe working – and it was so easy I almost feel sick with how much time I wasted on the previous methods.
Thank you Greg. Auto Iframe has genuinely made my day. (Small donation sent.)

Unlike many, I have seen no real issues with the plugin and find it very useful.
In my tests, you simply follow the directions and it just works. No tweaking required in my experience.
Best iFrame plugin I have found here on repository.

Really great plugin. I needed for one site to embed few Leadpages ifarmes and there was a lot of job to make it look good for all screen sizes but this plugin saved me hours and hours of hard work.
I even bought commercial plugin that should have the same function but it didn’t work at all. Still I can’t believe this works so great. Perhaps better support would attract more users of this fantastic plugin.
