Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper processing of the `$RUN-ID` parameter in the `pda/approve_center/prcs_info.php` file. This lack of proper sanitization or validation allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied input (`$RUN-ID` parameter) is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, leading to the theft of sensitive information.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- System Compromise: In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain control of the server itself, though this is not directly stated but a potential risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `pda/approve_center/prcs_info.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload injected into the `RUN_ID` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the Tongda OA application.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax: The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to construct the injection payload.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable versions are Tongda OA v11.2 to v11.10.
- The provided example shows the exploitation of the vulnerability to extract the database name by using `substr(DATABASE(),X,1)` to get the name character by character.
