  "cveId": "CVE-2024-47684",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `tcp_rto_delta_us` function in the TCP stack of the Linux kernel attempts to access a timestamp from a socket buffer (`skb`) on the retransmit queue without first checking if the `skb` pointer is NULL. In certain conditions, the retransmit queue can be empty, leading to a NULL skb pointer and a subsequent NULL pointer dereference when attempting to access the timestamp.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Lack of proper NULL pointer check"
      ],
      "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference leading to a kernel crash or panic, resulting in denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "This issue can be triggered by abnormal TCP packet loss and retransmission scenarios, which can be caused by network congestion, hardware failures or malicious activities. Both Time Loss Probe (TLP) and RACK retransmission methods can trigger the vulnerability.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to induce specific network conditions that lead to an empty retransmission queue and call the `tcp_rto_delta_us` function."
