```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` program's JSON command parser does not properly validate the type of the `param` JSON element, assuming it's always an object, leading to an assertion failure and device reboot if it's not.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
    "Denial of Service vulnerability due to assertion failure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering a reboot of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body containing a command with a `param` that is not an object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera. While most of these exploits require authentication, it's mentioned that it's possible to perform these API calls without authentication by leveraging TALOS-2021-1420."
