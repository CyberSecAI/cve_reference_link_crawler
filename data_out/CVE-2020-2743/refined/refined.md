  "cve": "CVE-2020-2743",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the xHCI component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an stack buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
  "affected_packages": [
    "app-emulation/virtualbox < 6.1.12",
	"Oracle VM VirtualBox < 5.2.40",
	"Oracle VM VirtualBox < 6.0.20",
	"Oracle VM VirtualBox < 6.1.6"

  ],
  "root_cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an stack buffer within the xHCI component.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor or disclose sensitive information.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Local access to the guest system",
    "Exploiting a flaw within the xHCI component of VirtualBox"
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system."
  ],
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located in the xHCI component of VirtualBox and is caused by insufficient validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to a read past the end of a stack buffer. This can be exploited by attackers to disclose sensitive information, and when chained with other vulnerabilities, to execute code in the hypervisor's context."
