Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of a fixed, predictable path `/tmp/swhkd.sock` for the UNIX domain socket used for communication between the `swhkd` daemon (running as root) and the `swhks` server (running as an unprivileged user).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure Temporary File Usage:** The use of a fixed path in `/tmp` makes the socket vulnerable to attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can pre-create the `/tmp/swhkd.sock` path, preventing the daemon from creating the socket, thus disrupting the normal functionality of the hotkey daemon.
-  **Information Leak:** An attacker can create their own UNIX domain socket at `/tmp/swhkd.sock`. When the daemon sends hotkey events through this socket, the attacker receives these commands, potentially exposing sensitive data depending on hotkey configurations and commands being executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must have the ability to create files/directories in the `/tmp` directory and have knowledge that `swhkd` uses this specific path for the socket.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by moving the socket file to the user's private `/run/user/$UID` directory, preventing unauthorized access.
* The provided resources indicate that this vulnerability was addressed in version 1.2.0 of `swhkd`.
