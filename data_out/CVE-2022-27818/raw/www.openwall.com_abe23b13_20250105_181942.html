Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in swhkd hotkey helper for Wayland

Hello list,

swhkd [1] is a pair of programs that allow to configure arbitrary
keyboard hotkey definitions for the Wayland graphics system, written in
the Rust programming language. The RPM package integration
submitted for openSUSE Tumbleweed contained an unusual Polkit rules
definition file that required a review by the SUSE security team [2].

As a result of the review multiple security issues have been identified.
The individual issues are described in the following detailed report.

1) Introduction
===============

1.a) swhkd Design and Operation
-------------------------------

swhkd consists of two components: `swhks` ("server") which runs in the
context of the unprivileged user to execute hotkey actions and `swhkd`
("daemon") which runs with root privileges to interact with keyboard
devices on uinput API level. The two components communicate with each
other via a UNIX domain socket.

It is a bit unclear if `swhkd` allows other modes of operation. The
function `permission_check()` is somewhat confusing in this regard. In
the end the only way to get it running is doing it as root, and the
README also points to `pkexec` for running it. So this is the only setup
that I analyzed for this report.

1.b) Scope of Review
--------------------

The target of this review was version 1.1.5 of swhkd.

1.c) Polkit pkexec Usage
========================

In version 1.1.5 of swhkd a Polkit rules file
"/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/swhkd.rules" is used containing the
following rule snippet:

```
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
      if (action.lookup("program") == "/usr/bin/swhkd") {
                return polkit.Result.YES;
      }
})
```

This means that any user in the system independently of a session
context is able to execute /usr/bin/swhkd as root via pkexec passing
arbitrary parameters e.g. also a compromised 'nobody' user account could
do it.

According to my recommendation upstream switched to using a Polkit
policy file instead that only allows local users in an active session to
run swhkd as root.

2) Security Issues
==================

2.a) Use of Fixed Temporary File in /tmp/swhkd.pid (CVE-2022-27815)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The daemon running as root uses this path to record its own PID for
instance monitoring. This fixed path has the following issues:

- local application DoS: if an attacker places the PID of an existing
  process there (e.g. PID 1), other users cannot start the daemon any
  more.

- local information leak if the kernel's symlink protection is turned
  off. The daemon logs the *full* content of the PID file to stdout.
  Example output of a run with a symlink pointing to a private root
  owned file containing the string "secret":

      [2022-03-21T15:44:28Z DEBUG swhkd] Previous PID: secret

- local system DoS if kernel symlink protection is off. The daemon will
  overwrite the target file with its own PID. This could also create a
  world-readable file in interesting locations that allow for further
  attack vectors in other programs.

- functional issue: such a setup is not suitable for multiple users
  using the software in parallel.

### Bugfix

The issue has been fixed upstream via the following commit:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/93/commits/ee3534b401cba71fddf378f7e1cb18ada0e6fa75" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/93/commits/ee3534b401cba71fddf378f7e1cb18ada0e6fa75</a>

The PID file is now placed into /etc, which fixes the issue, albeit is
an incorrect location. I suggested upstream to place this file in /run
instead.

2.b) The `-c` Daemon Command Line Parameter Allows for Arbitrary File Existence Tests (CVE-2022-27814)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example exploitation:

    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /root/.somefile
    [2022-03-22T12:32:25Z ERROR swhkd] "/root/.somefile" doesn't exist
    
    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /root/.bash_history
    [...] (daemon starts "normal" operation)

### Bugfix

Upstream tries to fix this via the following commit:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/105/commits/3c111663f2dcf8f28214ff1907169aa669fcf791" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/105/commits/3c111663f2dcf8f28214ff1907169aa669fcf791</a>

This commit now uses the external `cat` program to read in the
configuration file. Actually this is just a workaround, because the fix
for issue 2.c) is incomplete (only the root UID is dropped, not the root
GID, see [3]).

2.c) The `-c` Daemon Command Line Parameter Allows to Parse Arbitrary Files (CVE-2022-27819)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file passed to `swhkd` via `-c` will be completely read in by
`swhkd`. Any privileged file can thus also be processed. The daemon only
outputs the contents if something that looks like a hotkey definition is
found in the file, however. Since this syntax is pretty complex the
involved information leak is rather hard to exploit. Something like

    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /dev/sda

causes the daemon to "parse" the complete block device, exhausting
memory and causing high I/O load.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this by dropping privileges to the invoking user via
the following commit:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/8ddd40fdc0f1a356816671d6a91f067c112e4724" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/8ddd40fdc0f1a356816671d6a91f067c112e4724</a>

The privilege drop is still incomplete, because the root group ID
privilege is not dropped.

The security stance of swhkd can still be improved by dropping
privileges to the invoking user by default and only raising them for
privileged operations. I recommended this to upstream for follow up
changes of the codebase.

2.d) The Daemon Connects to a Fixed UNIX Domain Socket in /tmp/swhkd.sock (CVE-2022-27818)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For connecting to the unprivileged swhks sibbling process the swhkd
daemon connects to the fixed domain socket path /tmp/swhkd.sock. This
causes the following issues:

- local DoS: If an attacker pre-creates this pathname then the daemon
  cannot send out hotkey events and the unprivileged server component
  cannot start up successfully.
- local information leak: If an attacker places its *own* UNIX domain
  socket there, then the attacker will receive hotkey events instead of
  the legitimate user. The information contains the commands to be
  executed which is depending on the actual hotkey setup. In some cases
  this might even contain sensitive data.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this by placing the socket into the unprivileged
user's private /run/user/$UID directory. This is done via the following
commit:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/3187d7fc75fe5833f903b342941eebc1a56e5979" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/3187d7fc75fe5833f903b342941eebc1a56e5979</a>

2.e) Input Events are Consumed For all Keyboard Input Devices in all Sessions (CVE-2022-27817)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The daemon listens for input events on uinput device level. This means
even other users in other Wayland sessions or on the text mode consoles
will be affected by this. In theory this fact could be used to log
passwords and other sensitive information from other users. However,
recognized hotkey events will be discarded by the daemon i.e. if regular
key presses are configured as hotkeys then the keys seem to work no
longer. Therefore it is more like a local DoS for other users.

### Bugfix

This issue has not been addressed by upstream yet. My suggested fix is
as follows:

Establish a systemd Session Context: I think it is possible to determine
the current session the unprivileged user is in via systemd. Then the
daemon should pause its operation as soon as the active session is
changed to another one, and reactivate operation once the original user
session becomes active again.

2.f) The Unprivileged Server Process Uses a Fixed Temporary File in /tmp/swhks.pid (CVE-2022-27816)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue is similar to 2.a). The consequences are:

- local application DoS: if an attacker places the PID of an existing
  process there (e.g. PID 1), other users cannot start the server any
  more.
- local user file corruption: if kernel symlink protection is off, then
  the PID file can be a symlink to a private file in the user's home
  directory which will then be overwritten with the PID information.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this issue by placing the PID file in the respective
user's private /run/user/$UID directory. This is done in the following
commit:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/4b8442fef512441c9155186956c767a120c12974" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/4b8442fef512441c9155186956c767a120c12974</a>

2.g) The Unprivileged Server Process Receives Commands via /tmp/swhkd.sock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The socket used by the daemon (see 2.d) is created by the unprivileged
server. The daemon sends commands to be executed to this socket and the
server will execute them.

The UNIX socket `bind()` call only succeeds if the target file does not
exist yet and it also doesn't follow symlinks. Therefore an attacker
cannot pre-create this socket, without the server process failing to
`bind()`. For `connect()`ing to the socket the caller needs to have
write permissions on the socket. Therefore arbitrary other users cannot
send commands to the server process if a _sane_ umask is configured.

Should the user starting the server process *not* have a sane umask,
however, then the socket could become writable for other users and
therefore other users could execute arbitrary code in the context of the
unprivileged user:

    $ umask 0
    $ swhks &amp;
    $ ls -lh /tmp/swhkd.sock
    srwxrwxrwx 1 mgerstner users 0 Mär 22 13:46 /tmp/swhkd.sock

Since an overly open umask is an issue in itself I did not request a CVE
for this issue.

### Bugfix

To protect against this scenario the socket file is now placed in the
respective user's private /run/user/$UID directory. Furthermore for
hardening purposes a sane umask is applied. The following upstream
commit contains this change:

<a href="https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/707ea9915c9cf3d68b4a6729ac212a46a486e3fd" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/707ea9915c9cf3d68b4a6729ac212a46a486e3fd</a>

3) Timeline
===========

- 2022-03-22: I reported these findings to upstream privately. I offered
  formal coordinated disclosure, no defined embargo and publication date
  have been established though.
- 2022-03-23: Upstream started quickly to work on bugfixes which have
  been published on GitHub right away. Therefore increasing parts of the
  information has become public over time.
- 2022-03-24: I received CVEs for the issues from Mitre and communicated
  them to upstream.
- 2022-04-13: I asked upstream for permission to publish the full
  report, since most CVEs have already public fixes, some of them still
  incomplete though.
