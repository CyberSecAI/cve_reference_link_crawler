{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient permission checks when calling `keyguardGoingAway`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper access control leading to elevation of privilege. An application with insufficient permissions was able to call the `keyguardGoingAway` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege. An attacker could bypass intended restrictions or gain access to protected functionalities by calling `keyguardGoingAway` without the necessary permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An application attempting to call the `keyguardGoingAway` function without having appropriate permissions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an application installed on the device that can attempt to call the vulnerable function. The application likely needs some level of permissions, but not the specific permission required to invoke this functionality."
