Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` in the pow-auth/pow library does not properly invalidate expired cache keys on startup. Specifically, when all instances of `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` are shut down for a period longer than the key's Time To Live (TTL), the expired key is not removed from the cache upon the next startup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incomplete Cache Invalidation:** The primary weakness is that the Mnesia cache fails to remove expired session keys during application startup.
- **Session Persistence:** Expired session IDs remain in the cache, although they cannot be used for authentication because `Pow.Store.CredentialsCache.get/1` returns `:not_found`. The presence of these stale session ids in the database table and invalidator map allows an attacker to potentially hijack these sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Although the vulnerability doesn't directly allow for immediate authentication with the stale sessions, the potential exists for an attacker to exploit this if they can manipulate the application logic and reuse the expired session IDs to gain unauthorized access.
- **Accumulation of Stale Data**: The cache grows with invalid entries, potentially leading to performance issues due to increased memory usage and table lookups.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Application Restart/Shutdown:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application is shut down and restarted after the session TTL has expired. An attacker would not be directly causing the restart but could exploit the issue once it happens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No direct access required:** The attacker doesn't need direct access to the application's server, database or files.
- **Knowledge of application usage:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the vulnerable version of Pow and uses MnesiaCache. Also, the attacker needs to know how a session ID is formed to try and re-use it.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability after the application restarts after an expired session.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue stems from the logic within the `init_invalidators` function, specifically how it handles keys with a TTL of 0 (already expired).
- The `delete_or_reschedule` function incorrectly checks for a key's existence using `fetch(key)` and only clears the invalidator if it returns `nil`. This leads to stale invalidators and table keys if the check fails.
- The vulnerability was confirmed through manual reproduction, revealing that the expired keys and invalidators were not being cleared upon restart.
- The fix included addressing the incorrect key handling and ensuring that invalidators are cleared, even when the key fetch returns `nil`.
- The issue was resolved in version 1.0.34 of the `pow` library.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `MnesiaCache` backend, and session identifiers in this cache are namespaced as "credentials" and "persistent_session"
- A workaround is provided by manually invalidating the expired keys via an erlang command.
