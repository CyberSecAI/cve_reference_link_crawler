Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46978:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from missing access control checks when editing notification filter preferences in XWiki. Specifically, the `NotificationPreferenceService` did not properly verify if a user had the rights to modify or delete another user's notification filter preferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the filter preference ID in the request without verifying if the user is authorized to access/modify the resource associated with that ID.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The `NotificationPreferenceService` lacks proper authorization checks before performing actions on notification filters, allowing users to manipulate preferences of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Notification Filters:** An attacker can enable, disable, or delete notification filters belonging to other users.
*   **Loss of Notifications:** By manipulating filter preferences, an attacker can cause the target user to miss important notifications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to the `NotificationPreferenceService` endpoint, modifying parameters such as `filterPreferenceId` and `user` to target another user's preferences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the XWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of Filter Preference ID:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the filter preference they want to manipulate. This ID can be obtained by inspecting the HTTP requests when a user manages their own filters.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the XWiki server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present since version 13.2-rc-1
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1 and 16.0-rc-1
*   The vulnerability was reported by floerer on intigriti.
*   The fix involves adding proper authorization checks in the `NotificationPreferenceService` to verify if the user has the right to perform operations on the target filter.
