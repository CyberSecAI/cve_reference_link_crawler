### @marten-seemann **[marten-seemann](/marten-seemann)** commented [Aug 2, 2023](#issue-1834027618)

This is a backport of the Go standard library fix that triggered the Go 1.20.7 release. It's only needed for the quic-go version built with Go 1.20, as Go 1.21 uses the standard library crypto/tls.

[@mholt](https://github.com/mholt) Just a heads-up, there will be a v0.37.2 patch release very soon.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks Marten. I really had to cut a Caddy release yesterday but we will likely cut another one soon-ish, so I'll be sure to include this then. |
