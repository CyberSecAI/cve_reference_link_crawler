| Clients and servers which request and verify client certificates can be forced to expend a large amount of time verifying certificate chains which contain very large RSA keys during TLS handshakes.

`[[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates…](/golang/go/commit/659f2a22076713bd2500adc82e026b6a746d8ba1 "[release-branch.go1.20] crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates to <= 8192 bits

Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server
to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. Limit this by
restricting the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes to <=
8192 bits.

Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only
three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all
three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It
is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target
the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the
default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.

Thanks to Mateusz Poliwczak for reporting this issue.

… to <= 8192 bits

Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server
to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. Limit this by
restricting the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes to <=
8192 bits.

Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only
three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all
three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It
is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target
the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the
default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.

Thanks to Mateusz Poliwczak for reporting this issue.

| The fix has now landed both to release-branch.go1.21 (for the upcoming go1.21.0 release, and already included in go1.21rc4) and to the main branch (for the eventual go1.22.0 release). Moving the milestone back to Go1.21 since that's the earlier of the two. (We don't have dedicated backport issues for Go1.21 during early thaw.)  The title and description of this issue still need to be updated though. (CC [@dr2chase](https://github.com/dr2chase).) |

Are you using RSA keys > 8192-bit, or do you know of any common use of keys that large? Thanks. |

| For us, we distribute software built with Golang that is intended to be run in our customers' private networks. It is unlikely that any of our customers use such large RSA keys, but it's difficult to prove that they don't.  Without an "escape hatch" for this change, we probably have to pass this on to our customers as a breaking change, which complicates our release/support process. |

| The CVE for this hasn't been published yet, so maybe there's information forthcomming that changes how this appears, but this change seems analogous to if a hard limit to reads on a TCP connection were implemented at some arbitrary value, in the interest of preventing clients from denying service by issuing infinite data streams.  Similar caps to protect servers from malicious client behavior exist, but they're all configurable by the server. This cap is arbitrary, and hardcoded in the language. For users wanting to use 16K RSA keys for a client or server (testing, research, extreme paranoia for highly sensitive material), golang is no longer an option. |

| The 8192 bit limit was picked as it was considered an upper reasonable limit for acceptable verification latency, and because it was the upper limit of observed deployed keys. Surveying the web PKI, we found only two publicly trusted certificates containing 8192 bit or larger keys (both being 8192 bits). Since we primarily target the web PKI, this was considered an acceptable limit, since there were no known deployed publicly trusted keys above the limit.  Clearly people using private PKIs may use extremely large RSA keys, but it was my assumption that it would be extremely rare for anyone to be using keys larger than 8K, since that is already 2x the largest keys you typically see.  We generally try to avoid introducing GODEBUG flags in security changes (and in minor releases in general), but if it is clear that there are people relying on this behavior in the wild, we can look into introducing a flag that configures this behavior in the next minor release. |

My point is that golang has allowed users to customize via code which ciphers and TLS versions to use (including less secure options to a point). It has allowed users to customers to customize via code timeouts and maximum request sizes. Why was this any different? |

| Some things in crypto/tls are configurable for legacy or compatibility reasons, but conversely there are a number of things that are *not* configurable in crypto/tls. In particular, we don't support testing and research use cases through the public API, encouraging instead forks like uTLS, zcrypto/ztls, and BoGo.  To put the "extreme paranoia" angle in perspective, the NSA Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite requires 3072-bit keys all the way to Top Secret. The WebPKI root CAs have 4096-bit keys. Using keys larger than 8192 bits has no security justification, even in "extreme paranoia" threat models. |

| Hi,  I would like to underline that 16k TLS keys is the standard upper limit in most OS for at least a decade. By making an arbitrary hardcoded limit to 8k keys breaks the standard compatibility. This should be a parameter and not hardcoded.  Also, limiting the RSA key size is a weird way to fix this issue. It's like "your car AC sometime leaks ? Well I'll fix this by removing the AC of all the cars of the same brand. Now there is no AC leak anymore, but you can't have fresh air when it's warm outside.". It's not a fix at all, it's limiting/removing a functionality because for a large minority of users, sometime, it takes a "long time" (whatever this means) to check the RSA key.  On a side note, qualifying 16k RSA keys of "extreme paranoia" is kind of condescendant with the users using them : you don't know the use cases, you can't make any kind of judgement.  Kind regards |

Will you rull out RSA 8k keys as well and states that you don't support light hardware ? And next, when the same issue will be reported to you with IOT devices and RSA 4k keys, will you state that you don't support IOT devices and you will drop RSA support as well ?  The way this issue is fixed is ridiculous and against good developpement and security pratices. |
