# libp2p nodes vulnerable to attack using large RSA keys

Moderate

[p-shahi](/p-shahi)
published
GHSA-876p-8259-xjgg
Aug 8, 2023

## Package

gomod

go-libp2p
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.27.8, < 0.28.2, and < 0.29.1

## Patched versions

>=v0.27.8, >=v0.28.2, and >=v0.29.1

## Description

### Impact

A malicious peer can use large RSA keys to run a resource exhaustion attack & force a node to spend time doing signature verification of the large key. This vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension verification step.

To prevent this attack, go-libp2p now restricts RSA keys to <= 8192 bits.

### Patches

Users should upgrade their go-libp2p versions to >=v0.27.8, >= v0.28.2, or >=v0.29.1

To protect your application, it's necessary to update to these patch releases **AND** to use the updated Go compiler (1.20.7 or 1.19.12, respectively)

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds

### References

The Golang crypto/tls package also had this vulnerability ("verifying certificate chains containing large RSA keys is slow” [golang/go#61460](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61460))

Fix in golang/go crypto/tls: [golang/go@2350afd](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2350afd2e8ab054390e284c95d5b089c142db017)

Fix in quic-go [quic-go/quic-go#4012](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4012)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-39533

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
