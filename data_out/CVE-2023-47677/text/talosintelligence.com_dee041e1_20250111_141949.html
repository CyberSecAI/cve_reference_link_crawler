# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1872

## Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK boa CSRF protection cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability

##### July 8, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-47677

##### SUMMARY

A cross-site request forgery (csrf) vulnerability exists in the boa CSRF protection functionality of Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11. A specially crafted network request can lead to CSRF. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623

Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11

##### PRODUCT URLS

rtl819x Jungle SDK - <https://www.realtek.com/en/>
WBR-6013 - <https://www.level1.com/level1_en/wbr-6013-n300-wireless-router-54069103>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

##### DETAILS

The rtl819x Jungle SDK is an SDK for routers. This SDK uses as web server boa.

This Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK vulnerability was found while researching the Levelone WBR-6013 router. We are going to explain this vulnerability from the perspective of the WBR-6013 router.

The WBR-6013 router has a web server called `boa`. This web server has a CSRF mechanism that will not allow any API call until an HTML page that contains a form with that endpoint API is loaded.

This mechanism does not actually prevent CSRF. Indeed, exploitation of a vulnerability can first perform a CSRF bypass attack to the HTML page that will enable the desired API, as well as perform the actual attack against the desired API.

```
<html>
    <body>
        <form id='csrf' action="http://<DEVICE_IP>/boafrm/formSysCmd" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="sysCmd" value="reboot" />
        </form>
        <iframe
            src="http://<DEVICE_IP>/syscmd.htm">
        </iframe>
        <script>
            setTimeout(() => document.getElementById("csrf").submit(), 2000)
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

```

Via the majority of browsers, visiting the HTML page above would result in the browser including the `Authorization` header. This will result in the victim first loading the `syscmd.htm` HTML page, which will enable the `/boafrm/formSysCmd`. After 2 seconds the victim will be redirected to execute the `/boafrm/formSysCmd` API, resulting in a router reboot.

##### VENDOR RESPONSE

Realtek has provided updates software to their customers.
LevelOne has declined to patch the issues in their software.
