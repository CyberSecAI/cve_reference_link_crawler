* Vulnerability type: Use of a Broken or Risky  cryptographic Algorithm [CWE-327]
* CVE-ID: [CVE-2021-22948](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22948)

### Description

A security researcher has reported a vulnerability in the generation of session IDs, based on the cryptographically insecure uniqid() PHP function. Under some circumstances, an attacker could theoretically be able to brute force session IDs in order to take over a specific account.

### Details

The uniqid() PHP function was used to generate session identifiers and CSRF tokens, albeit with “more\_entropy” enabled. Both have been switched to the CSPRNG  random\_bytes() function.
