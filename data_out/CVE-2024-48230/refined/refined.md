- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `parentField` parameter in the `index` method of `funadmin\app\backend\controller\auth\Auth.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection because it's not sanitized before being used in a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  SQL Injection. The `parentField` parameter is passed to the `field` method in `funadmin\vendor\topthink\think-orm\src\db\BaseQuery.php` without proper filtering, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data exfiltration, data manipulation, or other forms of database compromise, potentially including the ability to escalate privileges within the application. In this specific case the attacker extracts the user from the database.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is exposed via an HTTP GET request to `/backend/auth.Auth/index.html` by manipulating the `parentField` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the application's backend and must be able to send HTTP requests with a specially crafted `parentField` parameter. Based on the provided PoC, the attacker also needs to be authenticated as an administrator.
