- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Redmi RB03 router with firmware version 1.0.57 does not properly verify the source of ICMP redirect messages, allowing an attacker to send forged ICMP redirect messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper verification of the source of ICMP redirect messages (CWE-940). The router does not validate the authenticity of ICMP redirect messages, trusting any such message received.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can hijack the traffic between a victim on the same WLAN and a remote server by sending forged ICMP redirect messages. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where the attacker can intercept and potentially modify the victim's traffic.  The attacker can sniff packets sent by the victim to the remote server, which could include sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a forged ICMP redirect message sent by an attacker on the same WLAN as the victim, and is received by the victim via the vulnerable router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same WLAN as the victim. They must be able to send network packets to the victim via the vulnerable router (Redmi RB03). The attacker requires a tool like Scapy to forge the ICMP redirect messages. The victim machine must have `accept_redirects` enabled (which is the default setting on Linux).
