- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper control of a resource through its lifetime. Specifically, the FortiEDR CollectorWindows does not prevent privileged users from terminating its processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) is present which allows for a process termination.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged user can terminate the FortiEDR processes, effectively bypassing the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) protection, leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local access. A privileged user can use special tools to terminate the FortiEDR processes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have privileged access on the system where FortiEDR CollectorWindows is installed. They also need to be able to use special tools to terminate the process.
