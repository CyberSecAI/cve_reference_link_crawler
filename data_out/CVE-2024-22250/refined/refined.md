- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VMware Enhanced Authentication Plug-in (EAP) contains a Session Hijack vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session Hijack
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor with unprivileged local access to a Windows system can hijack a privileged EAP session initiated by a privileged domain user on the same system, potentially gaining elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a Windows operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unprivileged local access to the same system where a privileged user has an active EAP session.
