Previously, the error message that Dependabot generated was only visible in the "Dependabot Alerts" section of the <strong>Security</strong> tab.

<ul>
<li>
<p>When your pull request's topic branch is out of date with the base branch, you now have the option to update it by rebasing on the latest version of the base branch. Rebasing applies the changes from your branch onto the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a branch with a linear history since no merge commit is created. To update by rebasing, click the drop down menu next to the <strong>Update Branch</strong> button, click <strong>Update with rebase</strong>, and then click <strong>Rebase branch</strong>. Previously, <strong>Update branch</strong> performed a traditional merge that always resulted in a merge commit in your pull request branch. This option is still available, but now you have the choice.

</li>
<li>
<p>A new repository setting allows the <strong>Update branch</strong> button to always be available when a pull request's topic branch is not up to date with the base branch. Previously, this button was only available when the <strong>Require branches to be up to date before merging</strong> branch protection setting was enabled. People with admin or maintainer access can manage the <strong>Always suggest updating pull request branches</strong> setting from the <strong>Pull Requests</strong> section in repository settings.

Rebasing applies the changes from your branch onto the latest version of the base branch, resulting in a branch with a linear history since no merge commit is created. To update by rebasing, click the drop down menu next to the **Update Branch** button, click **Update with rebase**, and then click **Rebase branch**.

If an alert only has a single analysis origin, no information about analysis origins is displayed on the alert page. These improvements will make it easier to understand your alerts.
