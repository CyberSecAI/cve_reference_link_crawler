- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the web filter block override form in FortiOS and FortiProxy does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]. The application fails to properly neutralize user-controlled input when generating web pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform an XSS attack via crafted HTTP GET requests. Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted HTTP GET requests targeting the web filter block override form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable FortiOS or FortiProxy instance. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must also be able to trick a user to click a crafted URL.
