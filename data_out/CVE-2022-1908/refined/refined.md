Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1908:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer over-read that occurs due to missing or insufficient boundary checks while parsing markup within the libmobi library. Specifically, it relates to how the library searches for links and attributes within the markup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read):** The code reads data beyond the allocated buffer when parsing markup in `src/parse_rawml.c`.
- Missing or incorrect bounds checks in the code when handling self-closing tags (e.g., `/>`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** A successful exploit can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information due to the buffer over-read.
- **Availability:** The over-read can potentially cause a crash or denial-of-service by reading from invalid memory locations.
- There is no impact on Integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, suggesting it could be triggered by processing a malicious MOBI file received via network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs a user to interact with a malicious MOBI file in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `libmobi` handles self-closing tags like `/>` in functions like `mobi_search_links_kf7`, `mobi_find_attrvalue` and `mobi_get_attribute_value` in `src/parse_rawml.c`. When encountering `/>`, the code decrements pointers (`--data`, `value--`) without properly checking if the pointer is still within the bounds of the buffer. This causes an out-of-bounds read when processing corrupted or crafted MOBI files, potentially leading to information disclosure or a crash.

**Fix:**

The fix is included in the commit [1e0378e](https://github.com/bfabiszewski/libmobi/commit/1e0378e6f9e4ae415cedc9eb10850888897c5dba). This commit addresses the boundary check errors by adding an additional check  `if (data <= data_end && \*(data - 1) == '/' && \*data == '>')` and `if (length && \*(data - 1) == '/' && \*data == '>')` before decrementing data pointers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also mentions that this commit also addresses CVE-2022-1907, as they share the same commit hash that fixed the vulnerabilities.
- The affected versions are unknown, but the fix is included in libmobi version 0.11 or later.
- There are no Dependabot alerts for this vulnerability, because it lacks a package from a supported ecosystem.
