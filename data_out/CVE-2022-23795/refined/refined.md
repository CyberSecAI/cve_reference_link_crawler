- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** Under very specific circumstances, this could allow an attacker to take over a user account.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the lack of binding between a user row and a specific authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to exploit the lack of authentication mechanism binding under "very special circumstances," which are not further elaborated upon.
