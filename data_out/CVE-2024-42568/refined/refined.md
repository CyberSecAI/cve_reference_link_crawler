**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the `/vehicle.php` endpoint of the School Management System application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an escalation of privileges, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete control over the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `/vehicle.php` endpoint using an HTTP POST request. The vulnerable parameter is the 'transport' parameter, which is used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/vehicle.php` endpoint. There are no specific requirements on the network position.
