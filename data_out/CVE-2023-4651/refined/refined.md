Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2023-4651:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**
The commit message "Fix SSRF Blind in the image upload" directly indicates that the code changes are related to addressing a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, which can be related to CVE-2023-4651.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's ability to fetch and process content from user-supplied URLs, specifically during image uploads. The code was vulnerable to SSRF because it did not properly sanitize or restrict the URLs used in the `uploadFromLink` function and the `file_get_contents_from_url` and `file_save_from_url` functions. This allowed an attacker to potentially make the server perform requests to internal or external resources the attacker does not have direct access to.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and filtering of user-supplied URLs before making requests to them. This means the server could be tricked into requesting internal resources or performing actions on external systems as dictated by an attacker.
   - **Insufficient URL validation**: The initial validation attempted to block IP addresses but did not account for more sophisticated exploitation methods.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Blind SSRF:** The commit message specifies "Blind SSRF," which implies that the attacker might not receive direct feedback from the server's request. Still, it can be used to probe internal resources, potentially revealing sensitive information about the infrastructure.
    - **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker could use the server to scan the internal network for open ports, leading to further reconnaissance.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** If internal systems are vulnerable, an attacker might use SSRF to extract data.
    - **Resource access:** Potentially access internal resources that are not directly exposed.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Image upload feature:** The vulnerable code is in the image upload functionality, specifically when uploading from a URL.
   - **User-supplied URLs:** An attacker would need to provide a malicious URL to the affected upload functionality.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the image upload functionality using a URL.
   - Access to the application's interface is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **uploader.php:**
    *   The `uploadFromLink` function now includes a check to validate the provided URL.
    *   It uses `filter_var` with `FILTER_FLAG_PATH_REQUIRED` to ensure the URL has a path component.
    *   It uses a regex check `preg_match('#^(?:(?:https?):\/\/)([0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}).\*#ui', $link)` to block URLs that point directly to an IP address.
*   **files.helper.php:**
    *   `file_get_contents_from_url` function now includes a similar regex check to block IP addresses: `preg_match('#^(?:(?:https?):\/\/)([0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}).\*#ui', $url)`.
    *  The `file_save_from_url` function has been updated to include `CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, CURLPROTO_HTTPS | CURLPROTO_HTTP` to force the use of HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and it has added `curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0)` and `curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false)` which, while related to secure connections, do not fix the underlying SSRF vulnerability directly.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code changes in `files.helper.php` are relevant for other functions that fetch content from URLs.
- The code attempts to prevent SSRF by blocking IP addresses, but does not fully prevent all SSRF techniques (e.g. using DNS names).

In summary, the provided code changes aim to remediate a Blind SSRF vulnerability by attempting to filter out potentially dangerous URLs. The commit provides more details than the generic CVE description.
