- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Event Theme <= 1.2.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The specific location or method of the injection is not mentioned.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, classified under OWASP Top 10 A3: Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when guests visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious script injection, likely through a user-controlled input field that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable part of the WordPress Event Theme. The attacker requires "Contributor" privileges which suggests a low-level account with limited permissions could still be leveraged to execute this attack.
