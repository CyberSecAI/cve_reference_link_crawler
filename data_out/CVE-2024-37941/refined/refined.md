- Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress plugin "Internal Link Juicer: SEO Auto Linker for WordPress" lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSRF vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- Attack vectors: An attacker could craft a malicious link or website that, when visited by an authenticated user, triggers actions in the vulnerable plugin.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that contains an exploit. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target site.
