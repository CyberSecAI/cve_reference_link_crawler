The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36400.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nano-id` crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. The `nano_id::gen` macro was also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size was specified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reduced entropy due to an inadequate character set usage
- Predictable IDs
- Vulnerability to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The reduced entropy makes the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attacks are possible due to the predictability of the generated IDs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to generate or intercept the IDs and then use brute-force to guess them due to the reduced entropy. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.

**Additional notes:**
- The `nano_id::base64` function was not affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was corrected in commit [a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23](https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 9.4, which indicates a critical severity. The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
- The weakness is classified as CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy.
