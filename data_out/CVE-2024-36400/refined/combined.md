# Unable to generate the correct character set

Critical

[fundon](/fundon)
published
GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94
Jun 4, 2024

## Package

cargo

nano-id
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

# Reduced entropy due to inadequate character set usage

## Description

Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified.

It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Impact

This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers.

## Patches

The flaws were corrected in commit [a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23](https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23) by updating the the `nano_id::gen` macro to use all specified characters correctly.

## PoC

```
use std::collections::BTreeSet;

fn main() {
    test_base58();
    test_base62();
}

fn test_base58() {
    let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();

    for _ in 0..100_000 {
        let id = nano_id::base58::<10>();
        for c in id.chars() {
            produced_symbols.insert(c);
        }
    }

    println!(
        "{} symbols generated from nano_id::base58",
        produced_symbols.len()
    );
}

fn test_base62() {
    let mut produced_symbols = BTreeSet::new();

    for _ in 0..100_000 {
        let id = nano_id::base62::<10>();
        for c in id.chars() {
            produced_symbols.insert(c);
        }
    }

    println!(
        "{} symbols generated from nano_id::base62",
        produced_symbols.len()
    );
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
