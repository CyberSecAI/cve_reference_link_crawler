**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GamiPress plugin versions up to 6.9.0 are vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcode(s).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the plugin's shortcodes.
- Attackers inject malicious scripts through user-supplied attributes within these shortcodes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to WordPress.
- They need to be able to create or edit content that uses the vulnerable shortcodes.
