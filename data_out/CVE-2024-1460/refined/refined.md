Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `RTCore64.sys` driver of MSI Afterburner version 4.6.5.16370. Specifically, the `0x80002040` IOCTL code within this driver is the source of the issue.
- The driver maps a physical address range (0xC0000 to 0xE0000, often containing BIOS information) into non-paged kernel memory via `MmMapIoSpace`, without proper checks on the physical address offset. This address of this memory is then leaked back to user mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Kernel Memory Leak:** The core issue is that the driver leaks the kernel virtual address that maps the physical memory region. An attacker with elevated privileges can exploit this to leak kernel memory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** While the code checks if the requested physical address is within a certain range (0xC0000 to 0xE0000), it does not adequately validate the offset being added to the physical address. This lack of proper offset validation allows the attacker to map a specific range of physical memory into kernel memory and then leak the address of the mapped memory.
- **Direct Mapping of Physical Memory**: The driver directly maps a physical address range into kernel space without adequate sanitization or privilege checks, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the leakage of kernel memory addresses which can be used in exploit chains.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While this vulnerability alone does not directly grant higher privileges, the leaked kernel address can be utilized by an attacker in conjunction with other exploits to bypass security mechanisms and potentially escalate privileges.
- **System Instability:** While not a direct impact, mapping arbitrary regions of physical memory into kernel space could potentially lead to system instability if misused.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted IOCTL call to the `RTCore64.sys` driver.
- The attacker must send a specific input buffer with a specific `InputBufferLength` (0x30) to the IOCTL code 0x80002040.
- The input buffer must contain a physical address within the range of 0xC0000-0xE0000 and a valid offset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
- **Elevated Privileges:** The attacker requires administrative or high-privilege access on the machine to interact with device drivers (specifically, to send IOCTLs to the `RTCore64.sys` driver).

**Additional Information:**

- The advisory provides a detailed breakdown of the vulnerable code, including the relevant IOCTL code handling and the `sub_11388` and `sub_11044` functions.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is mentioned, and its input/output is explained, showing how the vulnerability can be triggered and the kernel address leaked.
- The leaked memory contains BIOS information (including VESA/VBE2 strings) which may be useful for reconnaissance in further attacks.
