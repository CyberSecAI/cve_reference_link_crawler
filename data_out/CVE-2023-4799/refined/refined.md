- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page/post, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the plugin's shortcode functionality by injecting malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role in the WordPress site to create/edit posts/pages with the malicious shortcode.
