Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure Jinja2 templates within several Haystack components. Specifically, the issue is that the templates were being rendered without proper sandboxing, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Jinja2 Templating:** The core weakness lies in the use of Jinja2 templates without a sandboxed environment. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the templates, which will then be executed during rendering.
*   **Affected Components:** The following components were found to be vulnerable:
    *   `PromptBuilder`
    *   `ChatPromptBuilder`
    *   `DynamicPromptBuilder`
    *   `DynamicChatPromptBuilder`
    *   `OutputAdapter`
    *   `ConditionalRouter`
    *   `PipelineTemplate` class

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client where the Haystack pipeline is being run. This could lead to a full compromise of the affected system, including data breaches, malware installation, and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Template Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious Jinja2 template code through user-controllable inputs that are then used by the vulnerable components. This could be through directly providing a malicious template or via influencing data that is used in the template rendering process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Controlled Templates:** The attacker needs the ability to create or control the Jinja2 templates used by the vulnerable Haystack components. This is a key requirement.
*   **Haystack Pipeline Usage:** The attacker would need to interact with a Haystack pipeline where one of the vulnerable components is used and is set up to render templates. This could be a client-side pipeline or server-side.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Sandboxed Jinja2 Environment:** The fix involves using a sandboxed Jinja2 environment when rendering templates to prevent the execution of arbitrary code.  The `SandboxedEnvironment` class from `jinja2.sandbox` is used to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Input Validation:** Input validation is implemented to ensure that template variables are provided, preventing template rendering errors that might expose underlying system details.
*   **Restricted Output Types:** The fix limits the output types of `OutputAdapter` and `ConditionalRouter` to Python literal structures such as strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, `None` and `Ellipsis`, preventing the return of arbitrary user defined types.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Haystack version 2.3.1.
*   The fix involved changes to the `dynamic_chat_prompt_builder.py`, `dynamic_prompt_builder.py`, `chat_prompt_builder.py`, `prompt_builder.py`, `output_adapter.py`, `conditional_router.py` and `template.py` files.
*   The pull requests [#8095](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/8095) and [#8096](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/8096) specifically address this vulnerability.
*   The release notes for v2.3.1 provide a list of the components affected.
