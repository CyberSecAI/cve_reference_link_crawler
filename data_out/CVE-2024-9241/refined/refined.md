- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of `add_query_arg` without appropriate escaping on the URL in the PDF Image Generator plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user is tricked into performing an action like clicking a malicious link, the script will execute within the user's browser session. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code. Attackers would need to entice victims into clicking the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability and needs to lure a user into clicking a malicious link.
