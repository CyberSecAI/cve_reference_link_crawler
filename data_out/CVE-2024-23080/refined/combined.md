## Joda-Time

Joda-Time provides a quality replacement for the Java date and time classes.
The design allows for multiple calendar systems, while still providing a simple API.
The 'default' calendar is the ISO8601 standard which is used by XML.
The Gregorian, Julian, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopic and Islamic systems are also included.
Supporting classes include time zone, duration, format and parsing.

**Joda-time is no longer in active development except to keep timezone data up to date.**
From Java SE 8 onwards, users are asked to migrate to `java.time` (JSR-310) - a core part of the JDK which replaces this project.
For Android users, `java.time` is [added in API 26+](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/package-summary).
Projects needing to support lower API levels can use [the ThreeTenABP library](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP).

As a flavour of Joda-Time, here's some example code:

```
public boolean isAfterPayDay(DateTime datetime) {
  if (datetime.getMonthOfYear() == 2) {   // February is month 2!!
    return datetime.getDayOfMonth() > 26;
  }
  return datetime.getDayOfMonth() > 28;
}

public Days daysToNewYear(LocalDate fromDate) {
  LocalDate newYear = fromDate.plusYears(1).withDayOfYear(1);
  return Days.daysBetween(fromDate, newYear);
}

public boolean isRentalOverdue(DateTime datetimeRented) {
  Period rentalPeriod = new Period().withDays(2).withHours(12);
  return datetimeRented.plus(rentalPeriod).isBeforeNow();
}

public String getBirthMonthText(LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
  return dateOfBirth.monthOfYear().getAsText(Locale.ENGLISH);
}
```

### Development and Contributions

Joda-Time is developed using standard [GitHub tools](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time).
A [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) file is available, and PRs must comply with it.
The project can be built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), such as `mvn clean install`.
Continuous Integration takes place using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/actions).
Units tests are written in [JUnit](https://junit.org/) and run as part of the build and continuous integration.
Changes via PR must include appropiate test coverage.

Note that Joda-Time is considered to be a largely “finished” project. No major enhancements are planned. If using Java SE 8, please migrate to java.time (JSR-310).

### Release process

* Update version (pom.xml, README.md, index.md, MANIFEST.MF, changes.xml)
* Commit and push
* Ensure on Java SE 8
* `mvn clean deploy -Doss.repo -Dgpg.passphrase=""`
* Website will be built and released by GitHub Actions
