- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` binary. The `FUN_0041309c` function retrieves the `File` parameter from a JSON input and copies it directly to a local stack buffer without checking the length of the input, allowing an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By overflowing the stack, an attacker could overwrite return addresses, control the program flow, and potentially achieve remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted JSON POST request to the `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a large value for the `File` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means being on the same network as the device, or having access through a port-forward.
