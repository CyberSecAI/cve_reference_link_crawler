| Affected Products | * Confluence    + Confluence Server   + Confluence Data Center |

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels "https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels"). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Description

Atlassian has been made aware of current active exploitation of a critical severity unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server. The OGNL injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a Confluence Server or Data Center instance.

All versions of Confluence Server and Data Center prior to the fixed versions listed above are affected by this vulnerability.

This issue can be tracked here:

[CONFSERVER-79016](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-79016)

Getting issue details...
STATUS

Atlassian Cloud sites are protected

If your Confluence site is accessed via an [atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net) domain, it is hosted by Atlassian and is not vulnerable. Our investigations have not found any evidence of exploitation of Atlassian Cloud.

### Fix

We have taken the following steps to address this issue:

* Released versions 7.4.17, 7.13.7, 7.14.3, 7.15.2, 7.16.4, 7.17.4 and 7.18.1 which contain a fix for this issue.

**What You Need to Do**

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest Long Term Support release. For a full description of the latest version, see the [Confluence Server and Data Center Release Notes](/doc/confluence-release-notes-327.html). You can download the latest version from the [download centre](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives).

Note: If you run Confluence in a cluster, you will not be able to upgrade to the fixed versions without downtime, also known as a rolling upgrade. Follow the steps in [Upgrading Confluence Data Center](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/upgrading-confluence-data-center-1507377.html).

#### **Mitigation**

If you are unable to upgrade Confluence immediately, then as a **temporary** workaround, you can mitigate the CVE-2022-26134 issue by updating the following files for the specific version of the product.

#### For Confluence 7.15.0 - 7.18.0

If you run Confluence in a cluster, you will need to repeat this process on each node. You don't need to shut down the whole cluster to apply this mitigation.

1. Shut down Confluence.
2. Download the following 1 file to the Confluence server:

   * [xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar](https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-internal/opensymphony/xwork/1.0.3-atlassian-10/xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar)
3. **Delete** (or **move** the following JAR outside of the Confluence install directory):

   ```
   <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-8.jar
   ```

   ![(warning)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) Do not leave a copy of this old JAR in the directory.
4. Copy the downloaded **xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar** into `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/`
5. Check the permissions and ownership on the new **xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar** file matches the existing files in the same directory.
6. Start Confluence.

**Remember**, If you run Confluence in a cluster, make sure you apply the above update on all of your nodes.

#### For Confluence 6.0.0 - Confluence 7.14.2

If you run Confluence in a cluster, you will need to repeat this process on each node. You don't need to shut down the whole cluster to apply this mitigation.

1. Shut down Confluence.
2. Download the following 3 files to the Confluence server:

   * [xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar](https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-internal/opensymphony/xwork/1.0.3-atlassian-10/xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar)
   * [webwork-2.1.5-atlassian-4.jar](https://packages.atlassian.com/maven-internal/opensymphony/webwork/2.1.5-atlassian-4/webwork-2.1.5-atlassian-4.jar)
   * [CachedConfigurationProvider.class](/doc/files/1130377146/1137639562/3/1654274890463/CachedConfigurationProvider.class)
3. **Delete** (or **move** the following JARs outside of the Confluence install directory):

   ```
   <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/xwork-1.0.3.6.jar
   <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/webwork-2.1.5-atlassian-3.jar
   ```

   ![(warning)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/warning.svg) Do not leave a copy of the old JARs in the directory.
4. Copy the downloaded **xwork-1.0.3-atlassian-10.jar** into `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/`
5. Copy the downloaded **webwork-2.1.5-atlassian-4.jar** into `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib/`
6. Check the permissions and ownership on **both new files** matches the existing files in the same directory.
7. Change to directory `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup`

   1. Create a new directory called `webwork`
   2. Copy **CachedConfigurationProvider.class** into `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup/webwork`
   3. Ensure the permissions and ownership are correct for:

      ```
      <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup/webwork
      ```
      ```
      <confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/com/atlassian/confluence/setup/webwork/CachedConfigurationProvider.class
      ```
8. Start Confluence.

Remember, If you run Confluence in a cluster, make sure you apply the above update on all of your nodes.

**Note**: Confluence [End Of Life](/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html) versions are not fully tested with the workaround.

We **strongly recommend** upgrading to a fixed version of Confluence as there are several other security fixes included in the fixed versions of Confluence.
