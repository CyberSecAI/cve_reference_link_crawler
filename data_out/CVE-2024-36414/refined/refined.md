Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how SuiteCRM handles file verification within its connectors, allowing for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application can be tricked into making HTTP requests to arbitrary domains controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing access controls: Attackers can bypass firewalls, IP-based access controls, and the same-origin policy.
- Unauthorized actions: Attackers can make requests as if they originated from the vulnerable server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- Access to sensitive data: Attackers can gain access to sensitive data from internal services that the server can communicate with but are not directly accessible from the outside.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attacker can be remote (logically and physically) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable SuiteCRM instance.
