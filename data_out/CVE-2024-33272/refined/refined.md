Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `AutosuggestSearchModuleFrontController::initContent()` and `AutosuggestSearchModuleFrontController::getKbProducts()` methods of the "Search Auto Suggest" module. These methods make direct SQL calls using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization, which allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when building SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve various malicious outcomes by exploiting this vulnerability:
- Obtain admin access
- Remove data from the PrestaShop database
- Copy sensitive data from database tables, potentially exposing tokens and unlocking admin Ajax scripts.
- Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- Deploy webskimmers to steal credit card information

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP Call:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by making a crafted HTTP call to the vulnerable front controller. The vulnerability can be exploited via the `fc=module&module=autosuggest&controller=search` parameters with a malicious `keyword` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Anonymous Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited by any user that can access the PrestaShop frontend.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is actively exploited to deploy webskimmers to steal credit card data.
- The exploit may not appear in conventional frontend logs as "POST /" requests, making it difficult to detect using standard logging techniques.
- Using the AuditEngine of mod\_security (or similar) is the only way to confirm this exploit.
- The exploit may be concealed by changing the path of the module controller.
-  Updating PrestaShop can help prevent multiquery executions but does not completely mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities using UNION clauses.
