VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-38876

The affected application regularly executes user modifiable code as a privileged user. This could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:T/RC:C |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 8.5 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-38877

The affected devices stores initial system credentials without sufficient protection. An attacker with remote shell access or physical access could retrieve the credentials leading to confidentiality loss allowing the attacker to laterally move within the affected network.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 8.2 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |

| CWE | CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-38878

Affected devices allow authenticated users to export diagnostics data. The corresponding API endpoint is susceptible to path traversal and could allow an authenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the file system.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.2 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score | 6.9 |
| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-38879

The affected system exposes the port of an internal application on the public network interface allowing an attacker to circumvent authentication and directly access the exposed application.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
