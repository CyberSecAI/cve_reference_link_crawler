The provided content relates to a fix for a TX FIFO corruption issue in the `sc16is7xx` serial driver in the Linux kernel. This issue is a regression introduced by commit `4409df5866b7`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The EFR lock, intended to protect EFR register access, was also used to protect the shared data buffer used by both Tx and Rx handlers across multiple channels.
- When a packet was received on one channel (e.g., A) at the same time as a packet was being transmitted on another channel (e.g., B), the received data from channel A could overwrite the data in the Tx buffer for channel B.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Shared buffer between Tx and Rx handlers for multiple channels without proper protection.
- Incorrect assumption that EFR lock was sufficient to protect the data buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Corruption of data being transmitted on one channel with received data from another channel.
- In the described case, this resulted in a transmitted packet containing data that was intended for another channel's receive buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending data to one channel at the same time as data is being transmitted from another channel.
- Precise timing might be required to trigger the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send and receive data to/from multiple serial channels on an affected system.
- No specific user or system privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, as it lies within the driver's logic.

**Fix:**
The fix involves two steps:
1.  Use `kfifo_out_linear_ptr()` in `sc16is7xx_handle_tx()` to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer. This obtains a linear pointer to the transmit data in the FIFO, thus avoiding the buffer.
2.  Replace the chip-wise Rx buffer with a separate Rx buffer for each channel. Each `sc16is7xx_one` structure now has its own `buf` for receiving data.
