Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `/inc/root.php` file of the File Manager WordPress plugin. Specifically, the code lacked proper verification to ensure only authorized users could access certain functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a capability check, which allowed unauthenticated users to execute sensitive functions. This includes uploading and downloading arbitrary files.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers could upload malicious files to the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers could download any file from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script), an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Data Theft/Exposure:** The ability to download arbitrary files could lead to the theft of sensitive information.
*   **Full System Compromise:** A successful attack can allow an attacker to take complete control of the WordPress site and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP requests:** The vulnerability could be exploited by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoint (`/inc/root.php`) without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need any valid user account on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site's server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects File Manager plugin versions up to and including 3.0.
*   The fix includes adding a nonce check (`wp_verify_nonce`) before processing POST requests. This check ensures that the request originated from a legitimate source.
*   The plugin was patched in version 3.1, released on September 17, 2018
