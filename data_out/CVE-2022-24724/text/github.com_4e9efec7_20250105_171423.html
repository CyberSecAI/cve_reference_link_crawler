# Integer overflow in table parsing extension leads to heap memory corruption

High

[phillmv](/phillmv)
published
GHSA-mc3g-88wq-6f4x
Mar 3, 2022

## Package

cmark-gfm
(None)

## Affected versions

> 0.28.3.gfm.21, < 0.29.0.gfm.3
< 0.28.3.gfm.21

## Patched versions

0.29.0.gfm.3
0.28.3.gfm.21

## Description

### Impact

An integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing ([`table.c:row_from_string`](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/blob/766f161ef6d61019acf3a69f5099489e7d14cd49/extensions/table.c#L114)) may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables whose marker rows contain more than UINT16\_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used.

If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm releases:

* 0.29.0.gfm.3
* 0.28.3.gfm.21

### Workarounds

The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of `cmark-gfm`. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Felix Wilhelm of Google's Project Zero for reporting this vulnerability
