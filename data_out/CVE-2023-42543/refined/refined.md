- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper verification of intent by broadcast receiver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Bixby Voice application does not properly verify intents received by its broadcast receiver.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can access arbitrary data with Bixby Voice privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted intent to the broadcast receiver of Bixby Voice.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send intents to the Bixby Voice application. This likely means a local attacker with the ability to send broadcasts on the device.
