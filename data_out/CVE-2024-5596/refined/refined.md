**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5596

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Incorrectly implemented nonce validation on multiple functions within the ARMember Premium plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin fails to properly validate the nonce, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Unauthenticated attackers can modify or delete user meta and plugin options.
*   This can lead to limited privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   CSRF attacks are carried out by tricking an authenticated user into making unintended requests.
*   An attacker could craft malicious links or HTML that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute actions within the ARMember plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, the vulnerability exists for unauthenticated users.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to click a malicious link or trigger malicious HTML, typically through social engineering or malicious websites.
