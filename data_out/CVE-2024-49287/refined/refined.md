**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress PDF-Rechnungsverwaltung plugin, in versions <= 0.0.1, is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This means that the plugin does not properly sanitize user input when including local files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability of an attacker to include local files on the server. This occurs due to insufficient input sanitization in the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can include local files, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as database credentials or configuration files.
- **Potential Database Takeover:** If database credentials are exposed, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database.
- **Website Compromise:** In some scenarios, this vulnerability could allow a complete takeover of the website, depending on the exposed data and server configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, specifically by manipulating input to include arbitrary files on the server.
- The specific method of manipulation is not specified in the provided text.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
