- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the `schedule_exit()` function being called multiple times for the same peer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a logic error where the server can be tricked into not disconnecting a client.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated client can keep a session alive even after the server has been instructed to terminate the connection. This can potentially lead to resource exhaustion or other denial of service scenarios, although this is not explicitly stated.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious OpenVPN client can exploit this issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated client.
