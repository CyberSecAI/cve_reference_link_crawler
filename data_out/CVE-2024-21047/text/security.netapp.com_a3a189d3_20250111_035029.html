Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Oracle MySQL Server. MySQL Server versions through 8.0.36 and 8.3.0 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker with network access via multiple protocols or TLS to compromise MySQL Server. Refer to âOracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2024â for additional details.

#### Impact

Successful attacks of these vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) or a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of MySQL Server, or unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data.
