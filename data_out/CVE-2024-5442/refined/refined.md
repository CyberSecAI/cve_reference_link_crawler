Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of settings within the NextGEN Gallery plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding or managing albums, which allows for the storage of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the admin.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the 'Manage Albums' settings with a crafted payload in the album name.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have administrative level privileges (or similar high privileges that allows access to the 'Manage Albums' setting) on the WordPress site.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the "Manage Albums" section and be able to create or edit albums.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to navigate to a page/post where the NextGEN Gallery block has been used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the NextGEN Gallery plugin prior to 3.59.3.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   The CVSS score is 3.5 (Low), however, successful exploitation can have significant impact on the website and its users.
*   The attack is "Stored", meaning the malicious script is stored in the database and is executed when the affected page is visited.
*   The researcher who discovered the vulnerability is Krugov Artyom.
