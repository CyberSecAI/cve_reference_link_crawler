- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure parsing of XML-based RAIL documents within Guardrails AI. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing RAIL documents, which are XML-based. This allows for the injection of malicious XML entities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform XXE attacks, leading to the leakage of sensitive internal file data by exploiting the ability to read arbitrary files. In the provided example, the attacker is able to read the content of `/etc/passwd`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious RAIL document with a defined external entity that refers to a local file. When the vulnerable application processes the malicious RAIL document, it parses and attempts to resolve the external entity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted RAIL document to be processed by a vulnerable version of Guardrails AI.
