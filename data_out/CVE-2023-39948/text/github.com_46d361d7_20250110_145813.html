| Is there an already existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Expected behavior FastDDS should gracefully handle an unknown encapsulation kind. Current behavior FastDDS crashes (abort) - **Unexpected CDR type received**:  ``` $ ./DDSSecureHelloWorldExample subscriber Starting Waiting for Data, press Enter to stop the DataReader. Subscriber matched. terminate called after throwing an instance of 'eprosima::fastcdr::exception::BadParamException'   what():  Unexpected CDR type received in Cdr::read_encapsulation [1]    1931236 abort      ./DDSSecureHelloWorldExample subscriber  ``` Steps to reproduce  1. Run a subscriber process 2. My endpoint goes through PDP and EDP with the subscriber 3. When writers/readers and topic are matched, my endpoint sends the following DATA submessage to the matched subscriber:  ``` submessageId: DATA (0x15)     Flags: 0x05, Data present, Endianness bit     octetsToNextHeader: 48     0000 0000 0000 0000 = Extra flags: 0x0000     Octets to inline QoS: 16     readerEntityId: 0x00000104 (Application-defined reader (no key): 0x000001)     writerEntityId: 0x00000103 (Application-defined writer (no key): 0x000001)     [Topic Information (from Discovery)]     writerSeqNumber: 1     serializedData         encapsulation kind: Unknown (0x00ff)         encapsulation options: 0x0000         serializedData: 000000000d0000004d65737361676520697320310000000  ```  Note: encapsulation kind is 0xff (should have been 0x01).  Please refer to the attached tcpdump [fastdds-assert.pcap.zip](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/files/11117197/fastdds-assert.pcap.zip) for further details. Packet 358 triggers this.

### **[JLBuenoLopez](/JLBuenoLopez)** commented [Apr 11, 2023](#issuecomment-1502749839)

| Hi [@squizz617](https://github.com/squizz617),  [Fast CDR `read_encapsulation` method](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR/blob/master/include/fastcdr/Cdr.h#L147) is documented to throw besides `NotEnoughMemoryException`, also `BadParamException`. The code generated by Fast DDS-Gen only captures the first exception so I am opening a ticket also in that repository. But Fast DDS also calls this method without capturing every exception ([here](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/blob/master/src/cpp/fastdds/topic/DDSSQLFilter/DDSFilterExpression.cpp#L62) for instace). Instead of capturing a specific Fast CDR exception, any exception should be captured as it is done [here](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/blob/master/src/cpp/fastdds/core/policy/QosPoliciesSerializer.hpp#L942). |
