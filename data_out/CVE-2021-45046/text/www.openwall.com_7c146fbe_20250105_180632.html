Updating that for completeness: a bypass of that hostname restriction
was found by Alvaro Munoz, exploiting different URI interpretations by
the standard Uri class and JNDI.
Therefore 2.15 can be vulnerable again for RCE, if a layout
with attacker-controlled input outside the message is used or the
expression lookup has been re-enabled.

This also requires resolving a DNS name like 127.0.0.1#x.y.z or
localhost#x.y.z, which some resolvers and likely recursors will directly
reject.
