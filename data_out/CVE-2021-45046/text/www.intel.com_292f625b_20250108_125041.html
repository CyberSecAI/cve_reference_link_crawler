### Summary:

Security vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j2 for some Intel® products may allow escalation of privilege or denial of service. Intel is releasing product updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2021-44228](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) (Non-Intel issued)

Description: JNDI features in Apache Log4j2 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via network access.

CVSS Base Score: 10.0 Critical

CVSS Vector:  [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

CVEID: [CVE-2021-45046](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046) (Non-Intel issued)

Description: It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations

CVSS Base Score: 9.0 Critical

CVSS Vector:  [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

### Product Matrix:

Intel’s top priority remains the security of our clients and products. Product teams are releasing remediations for Log4j 2.x as quickly as possible, moving to the latest version available when developing mitigations.

The Intel product portfolio is under investigation to determine if the products are affected by CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 which are mitigated by Apache Log4j version 2.16, or higher. The vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j identified by CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 involve Java-based logging software. As such, Intel hardware products and graphic driver products are not affected.

While Intel has completed our initial scanning efforts, with so much active industry research on Log4j, mitigation and remediation, recommendations will continue to evolve. We are actively assessing the latest Log4j developments and will share updates accordingly. Please continue to check this advisory for updates.

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends updating the Intel® products listed above to the latest mitigated version (see provided tables).

Intel recommends using the Apache Log4j mitigations or workarounds for any affected products that cannot be updated or that do not have an updated product version:

[https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html "https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html")

### Acknowledgements:

These issues were found externally and were publicly disclosed as CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046 in December 2021. Intel learned of these issues at that time.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
