SSA-397453: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities (Log4Shell, CVE-2021-44228,
CVE-2021-45046) - Impact to Siemens Energy TraceAlertServerPLUS

Current Version:
V1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging library used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution.

Siemens Energy is preparing updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for TraceAlertServer-
PLUS.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Review the status of the defense in depth recommendations that apply to your speciﬁc deployment
and align as needed. Especially the measures on the network layer to prevent accessibility from
other network segments

• Restrict physical access to the local networks of the solution

• Ensure that TraceAlertServerPLUS does not run with elevated privileges

• Check ﬁle system permissions

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is

therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

TraceAlertServerPLUS is a software component installed in SVC PLUS energy transmission solutions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Apache Log4j V2, versions < 2.15.0 do not protect JNDI features (as used in conﬁguration, log
messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.
