The Frontend Registration â€“ Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 5.1 due to insufficient restriction on the '_cf7frr_' post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to modify the default user role in the registration form settings.
