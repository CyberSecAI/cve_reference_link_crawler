- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The affected products lack proper limitations on the number of authentication attempts, allowing an attacker to send numerous HTTP requests to the login form. This lack of restriction is identified as CWE-307.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can partially exhaust CPU and memory resources by sending numerous HTTP requests to the login form, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending numerous HTTP requests to the login form of the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
