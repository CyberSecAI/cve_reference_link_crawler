- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in FortiWeb's error controllers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the response webpage, potentially leading to execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Crafting malicious requests to the device's error handlers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the FortiWeb device. They do not require authentication.
