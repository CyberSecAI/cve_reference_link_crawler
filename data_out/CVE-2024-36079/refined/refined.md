Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper filename filtering during file uploads in Vaultize DRM v.21.07.27.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application allows uploading files with names that include parts of absolute file paths. This enables an attacker to control where the temporary file is created on the file system.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Because the application creates a temporary file in the path specified in the uploaded filename before download, attackers can write files to any directory where the application has write permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write arbitrary files to the server's file system with the privileges of the application, which could potentially overwrite existing files or create new ones in arbitrary locations.
- **Remote Code Execution:**  As demonstrated, this can be used to upload SSH keys to a user's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file and enable remote access to the system, achieving code execution on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Potentially, an attacker could overwrite application files to disclose sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the location and content of the written file, a local privilege escalation can be possible in some circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file with a specially crafted filename. The filename includes portions of the desired absolute path on the server's filesystem.
- **File Download:** Once uploaded, when the user attempts to download the file, the application creates a temporary file at the specified location using the provided name, writing its content into this temporary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the capability to upload files to the Vaultize DRM application.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the system, and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as long as the attacker can upload files.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was discovered on 05/05/2022, and a patch that fully resolves the issue was released on 05/15/2023.
- The exploit is demonstrated by uploading an SSH public key to the server, allowing the attacker to gain remote access via SSH, but the vulnerability is more general than that and could be used for different types of attacks.
