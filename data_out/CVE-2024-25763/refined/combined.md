Affected Version:
openNDS 10.2.0 c392cb41a4c470fd3be0e86c0de088c60262daf6

Vulnerability Description:
This vulnerability is a UAF (Use-After-Free) vulnerability discovered in the file /openNDS/src/auth.c. It could be maliciously exploited, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

openNDS WebServer download address:
<https://github.com/openNDS/openNDS.git>

Vulnerability details:

1.The function client\_list\_delete is called at line 222 in the file /openNDS/src/auth.c, passing a pointer named client, as shown below:

2.The client\_list\_delete function is located in /openNDS/src/client\_list.c. When the if condition on line 467 of the client\_list\_delete function evaluates to true, the pointer client is passed to the \_client\_list\_free\_node function on line 471, as shown below:

3.The \_client\_list\_free\_node function is located in the /openNDS/src/client\_list.c file. At line 448 of this function, the memory area pointed to by the pointer named client is freed, as shown below:

4.After the pointer named client is freed, the program accesses client->fw\_connection\_state at line 223 in the file /openNDS/src/auth.c, resulting in a null pointer dereference vulnerability, as shown below:
