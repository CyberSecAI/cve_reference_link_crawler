* **Labels:**
  None

* **CVE-ID:**
  CVE-2023-37272, GHSA-qr44-gm3x-7hfc

#### Description

**Vulnerability**

* Users specify file names when uploading files holding user-generated documentation for JOC Cockpit. Specifically crafted file names allow an XSS attack to inject code that is executed with the browser.
* Risk Mitigation: Risk of the vulnerability is considered high for branch 1.13 of JobScheduler (JS1). The vulnerability does not affect branch 2.x of JobScheduler (JS7) for releases after 2.1.0.

**Remediation**

* To prevent the vulnerability users can apply the following change to their JOC Cockpit installation:
  + The security header value for Content-Security-Policy configured with JETTY\_HOME/etc/jetty-rewrite.xml includes:
    ```

          <Call name="addRule">
            <Arg>
              <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.HeaderRegexRule">
                <Set name="regex">^((?!/joc/api/).)*$</Set>
                <Set name="name">Content-Security-Policy</Set>
                <Set name="value">script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'</Set>
              </New>
            </Arg>
          </Call>

    ```

* + The security header value for Content-Security-Policy should include:
    ```

    <Call name="addRule">
            <Arg>
              <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.HeaderRegexRule">
                <Set name="regex">^((?!/joc/api/).)*$</Set>
                <Set name="name">Content-Security-Policy</Set>
                <Set name="value">script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; frame-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'</Set>
              </New>
            </Arg>
          </Call>

    ```

* + JOC Cockpit has to be restarted to apply the change.
  + The change is applicable to JOC Cockpit release 1.13.11 throughout 1.13.18.
  + The new header prevents the execution of inline JavaScript. Until 1.13.18 inline JavaScript is used in a few places which will no longer work after the change is applied. These are
    - Upload button during import to the *Documentation* view.

      As an alternative the drag/drop functionality works. So an upload is possible!
    - Drag/drop functionality to configure a Job Chain or a Job Stream.

      The forms can be used for configuration instead of drag/drop.

      Configuring a Job Chain or a Job Stream is possible!

* The Content-Security-Policy header as implemented with [~~SET-204~~](https://change.sos-berlin.com/browse/SET-204 "Update security header for Content-Security-Policy") is made available starting from LTS maintenance release 1.13.19 of JobScheduler.
* Users without access to LTS maintenance releases can apply the above change to the JOC Cockpit configuration of earlier releases such as 1.13.11 (last public maintenance release) or later.
