## Description

Using crafted public RSA keys which are not compliant with SP 800-56B can cause a small memory leak when encrypting and verifying payloads.

An attacker can leverage this flaw to gradually erode available memory to the point where the host crashes for lack of resources. Upon restart the attacker would have to begin again, but nevertheless there is the potential to deny service.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
