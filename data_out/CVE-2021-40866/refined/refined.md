Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Name:** Demon's Cries

**CVE:** CVE-2021-40866

**Affected Devices:** Multiple NETGEAR smart switches (GC108P, GC108PP, GS108Tv3, GS110TPP, GS110TPv3, GS110TUP, GS308T, GS310TP, GS710TUP, GS716TP, GS716TPP, GS724TPP, GS724TPv2, GS728TPPv2, GS728TPv2, GS750E, GS752TPP, GS752TPv2, MS510TXM, MS510TXUP)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the NETGEAR Smart Control Center (SCC) implementation within the `sccd` daemon, which handles the Netgear Switch Discovery Protocol (NSDP). Specifically, the `sccd` daemon does not properly enforce authentication for "set" commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The sccd daemon does not require the type 10 "password authentication" TLV to be present in the NSDP datagram before processing "set" commands. This allows an attacker to execute privileged operations, like changing the administrator password without prior authentication.
2.  **Password Obfuscation Logic Bug:** The password is XORed with "NtgrSmartSwitchRock", but `strlen()` is used on the obfuscated password in the TLV type 10 handler. This causes incorrect password deobfuscation if the actual password has a character that is the same as the obfuscating string in the same position (resulting in a null byte after XOR).
3.  **Buffer Overflow:** In the TLV type 10 handler (even when SCC is disabled), the entire password from the TLV is copied to a 65-byte buffer without any bounds check. Sending a larger password can cause a stack buffer overflow, crashing the `sccd` daemon.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Device Compromise:** By exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability, an attacker can change the administrator password, leading to full control of the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow vulnerability can cause the `sccd` daemon to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is over the network using the Netgear Switch Discovery Protocol (NSDP) on UDP port 63324.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be on the same local network (intranet) as the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker needs to send specifically crafted UDP packets containing NSDP commands.
*   The SCC Control feature must be enabled for the authentication bypass to lead to a full compromise. However, the buffer overflow is triggerable even if SCC Control is disabled.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is similar to one found in 2012 in GS108E and GS105E devices.
*   The advisory from Netgear states the CVSS score is 8.8, while the blog post argues for a 9.8 score, as the attack vector should be "Network" instead of "Adjacent".
*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is provided, which can change the administrator password to "AlaMaKota1234".
*   The issue is present in firmware version V7.0.6.3 (and likely other versions) of affected devices.

**Proposed Fixes (as per the blog post):**
*   Require TLV type 10 (authentication) to be present and succeed before processing "set" commands. This needs to be verified on each UDP datagram.
*   Do not use `strlen()` on obfuscated passwords, instead rely on the known password size.
*   Reject authentication attempts where the password size exceeds the buffer size and limit the number of copied bytes in the memcpy operation.
