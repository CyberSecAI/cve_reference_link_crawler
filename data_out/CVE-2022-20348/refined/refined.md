Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient policy enforcement regarding location settings, specifically related to Wi-Fi scanning. The core issue lies in the fact that the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` restriction wasn't effectively preventing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning settings from being toggled within location services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate policy enforcement: The system failed to enforce the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` restriction, allowing users to potentially bypass intended restrictions on location settings.
- Bypass of intended restrictions: The vulnerability allows users to modify Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning settings related to location services even when they should be disallowed by policy, potentially leading to unwanted location data gathering or privacy violations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): While not explicitly stated as privilege escalation in the traditional sense, this bypass allows an entity to enable location services that should be disabled by policy, granting unintended access to location-related data. The vulnerability is categorized as a "High" severity EoP vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the user interface of the Android Settings application.
- An attacker with physical access to a device or an attacker who has remote control over the settings application could exploit this vulnerability by changing location settings to bypass the intention of the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the Android settings application or have a way to modify these settings on the device, either physically or remotely.
- The attacker needs to have a scenario where the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` is in effect but they are still able to change settings related to location scanning for Wi-Fi.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed by enforcing the `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` restriction on the Settings app.
- The fix is present in AOSP versions 10, 11, 12, and 12L.
- The provided commit message indicates that the issue was fixed by enforcing policy on location wifi scanning, preventing users from enabling wifi and bluetooth scanning for location services when `DISALLOW_CONFIG_LOCATION` policy is set.
