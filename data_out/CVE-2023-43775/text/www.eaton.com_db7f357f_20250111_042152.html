Overview

Eaton has been made aware of security vulnerability in the Web Server of its SMP Gateway
automation platform. The platform provides data concentration, protocol translation and logic
processing, a built-in HMI and secure remote maintenance access to substation and field devices,
reducing operating costs and increasing productivity for a large variety of applications.

Vulnerability Details

CVE-2023-43775

CVSS v3.1 Base Score – CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L

Successful exploitation of the issue can potentially lead to an unexpected restart of the SMP Gateway
automation platform, impacting the availability of the product. In rare situations, the issue could cause
the SMP device to restart in Safe Mode or Max Safe Mode. When in Max Safe Mode, the product is
not vulnerable anymore.

In all scenarios, the remote access to the SMP device is not lost. It is possible to connect to the SMP
device using the maintenance tools to apply the remediation and/or the mitigation measures (see
below).

Versions 6.3, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, all 8.0 versions before 8.0R9, all 8.1 versions before 8.1R5 and all 8.2
versions before 8.2R4 are not patched.

Eaton highly recommends that customers and or end-users implement these patches as soon as
possible.

Mitigation

Eaton recommends implementing the below mitigation measures only in the case where the users are
unable to apply the above patches.

The users can leverage the SMP Gateway’s firewall to significantly reduce the attack surface by
allowing connections only from specific IP addresses and subnets to the Web Server.

SMP Gateway automation platform users are advised to install the SMP device on a private network
or inside an ESP (Electronic Security Perimeter) or completely disable the Web Server in the
configuration file to mitigate this vulnerability.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external network for all control system devices and/or systems and ensure

that they are not directly accessible from open internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g., firewall), and

isolate them from the business network.

•  Remote access to control system network shall be made available only on need to use basis.
Remote access shall use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), updated to
the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.

•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.

v1.1

•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g., SNMP)

on the devices.

•  Create  security  zones  for  devices  with  common  security  requirements  using  barrier  devices

(e.g., firewall).

•  Use complex secure passwords.

Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of your control systems. For more information
