Denial-of-service vulnerability in the web server of the Eaton SMP Gateway allows 

attacker to potentially force an unexpected restart of the automation platform, impacting the availability of the product. In rare situations, the issue could cause
the SMP device to restart in Safe Mode or Max Safe Mode. When in Max Safe Mode, the product is
not vulnerable anymore.
