```
Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly validate user IDs when updating user information, leading to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- IDOR vulnerability: Lack of proper authorization checks when accessing user profiles.
- Ability to modify other user's data without proper authentication.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can modify the profile information (e.g., name, potentially other fields) of other users by manipulating the user ID in the request.

Attack vectors:
- Attacker needs to have a valid account on the vulnerable application.
- The attacker manipulates the `customer_id` parameter in the HTTP request to target another user's profile.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests using a tool like Burp Suite.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the `customer_id` of the target user.
