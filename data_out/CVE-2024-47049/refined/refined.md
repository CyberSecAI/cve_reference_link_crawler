The provided content is a security advisory for the `czim/file-handling` package, specifically addressing vulnerabilities present in versions prior to `1.5.0` and `2.3.0`. It does not directly correspond to a specific CVE but outlines vulnerabilities that could lead to security issues.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the functionality within the `StorableFileFactory` that allows loading content from local and remote URIs when using `makeFromUrl()` or `makeFromAny()`. This behavior, when not explicitly controlled, can lead to unintended access to local files or SSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Local Data Exposure:** The application would load contents from local file URIs (e.g. `file://../../.secrets`) when the `makeFromUrl` or `makeFromAny` functions are used. This allows attackers to read sensitive local files if they can control or influence the provided URI.
2.  **Remote Data Access (SSRF):** The application would load contents from remote URIs (e.g. `https://...`) when the `makeFromUrl` or `makeFromAny` functions are used. If the URI can be controlled by an attacker, this could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks where the application makes requests to attacker-controlled servers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

1.  **Local Data Exposure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive files on the server's file system, potentially containing secrets, configuration details, or other confidential information.
2.  **Remote Data Access (SSRF):** Attackers could potentially use the server to make requests to other internal or external servers. This could be used to scan internal networks, exfiltrate data, or launch attacks on other services.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is the ability to control or influence the URI passed to the `makeFromUrl()` or `makeFromAny()` methods of the `StorableFileFactory`. This could happen if:

*   An application directly uses user-supplied data as input to these functions.
*   An application constructs the URL from a combination of user-controlled data and internal configurations
*   An attacker influences the provided URI through a vulnerable component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker would need to be able to influence the URI that is passed to the vulnerable functions. This could be achieved through a variety of means, depending on the specific implementation of the application. Common scenarios include:

*   Controlling input parameters to a web application
*   Influencing data stored in a database or configuration file
*   Manipulating data sent to the application through an API or other interface.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is addressed in newer versions of the library by changing the behavior of the `makeFromUrl()` and `makeFromAny()` functions so that they no longer process local or remote URLs by default. The old behavior can be re-enabled by using the `allowLocalUri()` and `allowRemoteUri()` methods on the `UriValidator` class.
