| **Important notices**  Before you add a new report, we ask you kindly to acknowledge the following:   * I have read the contributing guide lines at <https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md> * I am convinced that my issue is new after having checked both open and closed issues at <https://github.com/opnsense/core/issues?q=is%3Aissue>   **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  This is a tracking ticket to explain some existing ideas which also relate to our basic strategy as described in <https://docs.opnsense.org/development/guidelines/basics.html#strategy> (long term goals).  When at some point in time we are able to ditch root access for the at least the webui, we can start thinking about adding a trust model on top of `configd` as well. Since we are using a unix domain socket to detach sensitive parts, we are also able to utilize extended socket information to further safeguard the system commands being executed.  **Describe the solution you like**  Implement the use of `LOCAL_PEERCRED` as explained in <https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=unix&sektion=4> after which we could also extend the configuration attributes with a list of users or groups which should be able to execute specific methods.  When we do know who called us, we could also add this information in the logging stream.  **Additional context**  Implementation wise in `configd` we can hook into the connect here <https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/1c05a19d9d52c7bfa4ac52114935d9fe76d5d181/src/opnsense/service/modules/processhandler.py#L93C48-L93C48>  And extract the peercreds using a construct like:  ``` import struct # xucred structure defined in : https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=unix&sektion=4 # XU_NGROUPS is 16 xucred_fmt = '2ih16iP' tmp = connection.getsockopt(0, socket.LOCAL_PEERCRED, struct.calcsize(xucred_fmt)) tmp = tuple(struct.unpack(xucred_fmt, tmp)) print( {     'cr_version': tmp[0],     'cr_uid': tmp[1],     'cr_ngroups': tmp[2],     'cr_groups': tmp[3:18],     'cr_pid': tmp[19] })  ``` |

Use socket.LOCAL_PEERCRED to fetch the callers credentials so we are able to log system (shell) users calling our configuration engine.
Messages are send to our Audit log using severity informational (action succeeded) or error (not allowed or unknown action), this needs a small change in our syslog template to exclude the audit messages (included in this commit).

While here, also add a general overwrite for settings that should apply for all actions, as this would ease applying future default restrictions for all actions.
Action defaults can be set in configd.conf using the following construct:

[action_defaults]
allowed_groups = wheel

To require group membership, the `allowed_groups` option is added to the action, when set, the connected user should be a member to at least one of the mentioned groups. For example, to require wheel membership for a call \"echo\", the configuration might look like this:

[echo]
command:echo
parameters:%s
type:script_output
allowed_groups = wheel

Finally, remove the simulation mode for the configd service as this is less useful nowadays.")`
