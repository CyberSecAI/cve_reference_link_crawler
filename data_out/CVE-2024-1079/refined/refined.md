Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ays_show_results()` function within the Quiz Maker plugin. Specifically, the function did not verify if the user was authorized to access quiz results data, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core weakness is the lack of a capability check before allowing access to quiz results. This means that the function doesn't verify if the user has the necessary permissions to view the data, leading to a direct object reference vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Unauthenticated attackers could fetch arbitrary quiz results, potentially exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contained within those results.
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation leads to the disclosure of quiz data to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network/Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network, as the function is accessible via an AJAX call.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The lack of authorization means that the attacker does not need to be logged in or have any user account on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special capabilities needed:**  The attacker only needs to be able to send a network request to the WordPress site, and be able to determine the correct parameters to send.
- **No authenticated access needed:**  The attacker doesn't need to have any user account on the target WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is present in all versions of the Quiz Maker plugin up to and including 6.5.2.4.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 6.5.2.5, which added security checks to address the missing authorization in the affected functions.
- The fix includes adding calls to `check_ajax_referer` and `current_user_can('manage_options')` in the affected functions to verify the request and ensure the user is authorized to perform the action.
