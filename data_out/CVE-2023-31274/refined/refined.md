The provided content is related to CVE-2023-31274.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing release of resources after their effective lifetime (CWE-772).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a missing release of resource after effective lifetime vulnerability. Specifically, the AVEVA PI Server does not properly release memory resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause the PI Message Subsystem of a PI Server to consume available memory, resulting in throttled processing of new PI Data Archive events and a partial denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based and exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to have network access to the PI Server and does not require any prior authentication. The attacker requires low attack complexity to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
