## Description

This is a simple parallax image plugin that uses the parallax.js script by pixelcog – http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/

To insert your full width parallax image, simply use the [dd-parallax] shortcode. Include text to be overlaid on the parallax between the open and close [/dd-parallax] code. This plugin has been tested with WordPress 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 themes as well as a few themes that use Bootstrap. I can’t guarantee that it will work with all themes, but it’s worth a shot.

\*\* Please note for WP 5.0 \*\*

Currently this plugin works, but the TinyMCE button only works with the classic editor. A Gutenberg widget is in the works.

For example:

```
[dd-parallax img="imagename.jpg" height="600" speed="3" z-index="-100" mobile="mobile-image.jpg" offset="true"]

Text to be overlaid on the paralllax window

[/dd-parallax]

```

Available parameters for use:

* img – use the filename from the media library for this, not the full path. Just use imagename.jpg or image.png. (You can also use a fully qualified URL)
* height – This is the height of the parallax window. The unit is in pixels. Just enter a number
* speed [optional] (default = 2) An integer between 0 and 10. The speed at which the parallax effect runs. 0 means the image will appear fixed in place, and 10 the image will flow at the same speed as the page content.
* z-index [optional] (default = 0) – The z-index value of the fixed-position elements. By default these will be behind everything else on the page.
* mobile [optional] – If you want a mobile fixed image for mobile display, choose a different image, otherwise it will select the full sized image from the parallax and make it a responsive image.
* offset [default = false] (options: “true” or “false”) – This will pull the parallax content all the way to the left of your screen. You can put the contents into a “container” class if you’re using bootstrap or just center the contents for horizontal centering. On testing with the WordPress 2016 Theme, keep offset at False. With Bootstrap Themes, I recommend using the “offset=’true’” parameter.
* position [optional] – (defaults to ‘Left’) This is analogous to the background-position-x css property. Specify coordinates as right, left, center, or pixel values (e.g. -10px 0px). The parallax image will be positioned as close to these values as possible while still covering the target element.
* text-pos [optional] – Default is ‘top’ (to maintain compatibility with ver 1.6). Available options are “top”, “center”, “bottom”.

Admin-Settings page enables or disables the TinyMCE icon (if you don’t want it in your WP-Editor)

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/parallax-image` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.

## FAQ

### I’m not seeing the image on the screen, what did I do wrong?

For this – there are 2 probable reasons that you’re not seeing the parallax.

\* First – Check to make sure that your img is only the file name, and not the full path. If you view the media library in “list” mode yourdomain.com/wp-admin/upload.php?mode=list – there you’ll see the filename with the .jpg or .png extension.

\* Second – If not the first answer. Check your z-index. Changing the z-index will adjust the layering of your screen with CSS, and may need to be changed depending on how your theme displays the backgrounds and colors. For more about z-index – [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp)

### Can I have multiple parallax images on each page.

Yes

### Will this work on mobile devices

For mobile devices, you can either have a totally separate mobile image by using the ‘mobile’ parameter in the shortcode, or you can just have the main parallax image resize itself and be responsive.

### While I’m debugging, the mobile test doesn’t look right

If you’re resizing your browser window to check for responsiveness, the plugin uses mobile\_detect, so you must either spoof your user agent, or test on a real mobile device. You might have to refresh for it to work right.

Hard to find a full image scroll shortcode that works in a <div>, and this one does. Simple shortcode, good variables, just works.
Thank you for this. Please keep it updated!
