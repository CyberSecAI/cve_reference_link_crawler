{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's `dd-parallax` shortcode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This allows for malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `dd-parallax` shortcode, where malicious scripts can be embedded within the shortcode attributes.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit content and insert the malicious shortcode."
