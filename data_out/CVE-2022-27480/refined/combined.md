SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20220413-0 >
=======================================================================
               title: Missing Authentication at File Download & Denial of Service
             product: Siemens A8000 CP-8050/CP-8031 SICAM WEB
  vulnerable version: < SICAM WEB Version 05.80 / < Firmware Package 04.80
       fixed version: SICAM WEB V05.80 / Firmware Package 04.80
          CVE number: CVE-2022-27480
              impact: Medium
            homepage: <https://www.siemens.com>
               found: 2021-11-10
                  by: SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab
                      This vulnerability was discovered during the research
                      cooperation initiative "OT Cyber Security Lab" between
                      Verbund AG and SEC Consult Group.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Update to the current firmware in order to fix the missing authentication vulnerability.
Siemens will not fix the denial of service vulnerability.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve
potential further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Missing Authentication at File Download (CVE-2022-27480)
Several files that can be created by an authorized user are placed in the
web server's root directory. The user can then download these files with a
press on a UI button. However, the files are not deleted automatically after
the user downloads them. The filenames are static and the download does not
require any authentication. Therefore, they can be retrieved by anybody later.

2) Denial of Service Condition
The PLC will stop responding to any connection attempts as soon as a light
network load is placed on it. This effectively shuts down the management
interfaces.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Missing Authentication at File Download (CVE-2022-27480)
First, a file has to be created. This is possible by logging into SICAM Web.
As an example, a network traffic capture can be created by navigating to
"Monitoring & Simulation" -> "Ethernet Packet Capture".

The following request shows how another client downloads the resulting
wireshark.zip file without sending any authentication headers.

-----------------------------
GET /wireshark.zip HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]
-----------------------------

The server responds with the created capture file:
-----------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/zip
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private
Content-Length: 370
Server: A8000
[...]

PKÃV\S!ÃM>wireshark0.pcap
[...]
------------------------------

2) Denial of Service Condition
Putting a light network load on the PLC's interfaces causes a denial of
service condition. In the tests it was enough to run a directory bruteforce
with 5 threads in order to shut down all management interfaces. After the
scan stopped, it took several minutes for the PLC to come back online.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following product has been tested:
* Siemens A8000 CP-8050 SICAM Web 05.50

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2022-02-07: Contacting vendor through productcert () siemens com
2022-02-07: Siemens opened ticket, Issue 1 is already known for another product (CVE-2021-45034)
2022-02-09: Provided further information about the PLC version to Siemens
2022-02-10: Information forwarded to developers
2022-02-15: Siemens identified the right model, does not consider DoS as
             valid finding, as it does not stop the control loop from running and it is
             not an edge device
2022-03-22: Siemens asks to move disclosure date to their patch day on April 12th.
             SEC Consult agrees. Siemens now recognizes the DoS condition, but is
             accepting the risk and won't patch.
2022-03-28: Informing Siemens that our advisory will be coordinated with their patch
             day.
2022-04-12: Siemens patch day and Siemens advisory release.
2022-04-13: SEC Consult advisory release.

Solution:
---------
For issue 1: Update to the current firmware, for further information see the advisory from
the vendor:

<https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-316850.html>

For issue 2: Siemens marked this vulnerability as wont-fix.
The issue will/can not be patched by software. Siemens accepts the risk, as
the control loop keeps running and the device is not an edge device.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the A8000 and make sure, that your use-case does
not send traffic exceeding the DoS limitation.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines can be found at:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) series is a modular device range for telecontrol and
automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-27480

Affected devices do not require an user to be authenticated to access certain ﬁles. This could allow
unauthenticated attackers to download these ﬁles.
