Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of authentication for accessing certain files stored on the web server of the affected Siemens SICAM A8000 devices. These files are created by authorized users but can be downloaded by anyone without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication requirements for downloading specific files, such as those generated by the "Ethernet Packet Capture" feature.
*   **Static Filenames:** The files are saved with static filenames, making it easy for attackers to predict and access them.
*   **No Automatic Deletion:** The files are not automatically deleted after being downloaded, allowing for continued access by unauthorized parties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download files created by authorized users, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as network traffic captures (wireshark.zip).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Any individual can gain access to the files without needing credentials, leading to a potential data leak.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only needs network access to the device hosting the webserver.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the webserver with the known static filename of the target file (e.g., `/wireshark.zip`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   **Knowledge of the static filename:** The attacker needs to know or guess the filename of the file they wish to download.
*   **No prior authorization:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication or authorization credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vendor will not fix the denial-of-service vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-862: Missing Authorization.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)
