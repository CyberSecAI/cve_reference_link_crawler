  execution in Dart, the `callback`, that receives events from platform codes,
  now must be a static or top-level function. There's also an additional native
  configuration required on both of iOS and Android. See README for detail.
* Android: upgrade `WorkManager` to v2.2.0.
* Fix bug `SecurityException` when saving image/videos to internal storage in
  Android

## 1.2.0 [#](#120)

* Android: support `FlutterFragmentActivity`, fix bug downloaded image/video
  files not shown in Gallery application, improved HTTP redirection
  implementation, fix bug cannot open apk file in some cases

## 1.1.9 [#](#119)

* Android: support HTTP redirection
* iOS: correct getting file name from HTTP response

## 1.1.8 [#](#118)

* Fix bug in iOS: from iOS 8, absolute path to app's sandbox changes every time
  you relaunch the app, hence `savedDir` path is needed to truncate the changing
  part before saving it to DB and recreate the absolute path every time it
  loaded from DB. Currently, the plugin only supports save files in
  `NSDocumentDirectory`.
* Fix bug is iOS: setting wrong status of task in case that the application is
  terminated
* Android: upgrade dependencies

## 1.1.7 [#](#117)

* Android: upgrade `WorkManager` to version 2.0.0 (AndroidX)

## 1.1.1 [#](#111)

* correct `README` instruction

## 1.1.0 [#](#110)

* Android: upgrade `WorkManager` library to version v1.0.0-alpha11
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `initialize()` is removed (to deal with the change of the
  initialization of `WorkManager` in v1.0.0-alpha11). The plugin initializes
  itself with default configurations. If you would like to change the default
  configuration, you can follows the instruction in `README.md`

## 1.0.6 [#](#106)

* fix bug related to `filename`

## 1.0.5 [#](#105)

* Android: re-config dependencies

## 1.0.4 [#](#104)

* Android: upgrade WorkManager to v1.0.0-alpha10

## 1.0.3 [#](#103)

* Android: upgrade compile sdk version to 28

## 1.0.2 [#](#102)

* Fixed Flutter Community badge.

## 1.0.1 [#](#101)

* Moved package to [Flutter Community](https://github.com/fluttercommunity)

## 1.0.0 [#](#100)

* **NEW** features: initialize, loadTasksWithRawQuery, pause, resume, retry,
  open
* **IMPORTANT**: the plugin must be initialized by `initialize()` at first
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `clickToOpenDownloadedFile` now renames to
  `openFileFromNotification` (to prevent confusing from `open` feature). Static
  property `maximumConcurrentTask` has been removed, this configuration now
  moves into `initialize()` method.
* full support SQLite on both Android and iOS side, the plugin now itself
  manages its states persistently and exposes `loadTasksWithRawQuery` api that
  helps developers to load tasks from SQLite database with customized conditions
* support localizing Android notification messages with `messages` parameter of
  `initialize()` method
* full support opening and previewing downloaded file with `open()` method
* (iOS integration) no need to override
  `application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:` manually
  anymore, the plugin now itself takes responsibility for handling it

## 0.1.1 [#](#011)

* fix bugs: SQLite leak
* new feature: support configuration of the maximum of concurrent download tasks
* upgrade WorkManager to v1.0.0-alpha08

## 0.1.0 [#](#010)
