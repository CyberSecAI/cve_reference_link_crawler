{
  "cveId": "CVE-2021-28714",
  "description": "Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in denial of service.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The Linux kernel's netback driver buffers incoming data packets for a guest until the guest is ready to process them. The timeout mechanism for stalled clients can be bypassed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The timeout for a client not consuming packets is too long, allowing excessive data accumulation.",
      "The timeout might not trigger if the guest only has one free slot in its RX queue ring page, and the next packet requires more than one, especially with GSO, XDP or software hashing."
    ],
    "impact": "A Xen guest can force the Linux netback driver to queue excessive network data, leading to an out-of-memory condition in the domain where the backend runs (usually dom0), causing a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious Xen guest sending network traffic.",
       "Exploiting the netback driver's buffering mechanism to accumulate excessive amounts of data."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "A malicious Xen guest capable of sending network traffic and manipulating its RX queue."
