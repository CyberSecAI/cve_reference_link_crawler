Advisory ID:       | SQUID-2022:1
Date:              | September 23, 2022

<<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41317>>
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

  Due to inconsistent handling of internal URIs Squid is
  vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information about clients
  using the proxy.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

  This problem allows a trusted client to directly access cache
  manager information bypassing the manager ACL protection.

  The available cache manager information contains records of
  internal network structure, client credentials, client identity
  and client traffic behaviour.

CVSS Score of 6.4

Updated Packages:

This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.7.

  In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
  releases can be found in our patch archives:

Squid 4:
  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/SQUID-2022_1.patch>>

Squid 5:
  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/SQUID-2022_1.patch>>

  If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
  to the package vendor for availability information on updated
  packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

  Squid older than 4.9 are not vulnerable.

  All Squid-4.9 up to and including 4.14 have not been tested, but
  should be assumed to be vulnerable.

  All Squid-4.15 up to and including 4.17 are vulnerable.

  All Squid-5.0.6 up to and including 5.6 are vulnerable.

__________________________________________________________________

Workaround:

   Add the following to squid.conf:

     acl manager url_regex +i ^[^:]+://[^/]+/squid-internal-mgr/
