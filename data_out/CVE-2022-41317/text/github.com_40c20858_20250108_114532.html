# SQUID-2022:1 Exposure of Sensitive Information in Cache Manager

Moderate

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-rcg9-7fqm-83mq
Sep 23, 2022

## Package

squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

4.9-4.17, 5.0.6-5.6

## Patched versions

5.7

## Description

Due to inconsistent handling of internal URIs Squid is

vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information about clients

using the proxy.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a trusted client to directly access cache

manager information bypassing the manager ACL protection.

The available cache manager information contains records of

internal network structure, client credentials, client identity

and client traffic behaviour.

CVSS Score of 6.4

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:H/MI:X/MA:X&version=3.1>

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.7.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 4:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/SQUID-2022_1.patch>

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2022_1.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer

to the package vendor for availability information on updated

packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

Squid older than 4.9 are not vulnerable.

All Squid-4.9 up to and including 4.14 have not been tested, but

should be assumed to be vulnerable.

All Squid-4.15 up to and including 4.17 are vulnerable.

All Squid-5.0.6 up to and including 5.6 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

Add the following to squid.conf:

```
acl manager url_regex +i ^[^:]+://[^/]+/squid-internal-mgr/

```

---

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your

primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<http://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
