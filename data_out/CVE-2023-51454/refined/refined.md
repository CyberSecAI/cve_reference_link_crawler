- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `my_tcp_receive` function within the `libv2_sdk.so` library, which is used by the `dji_vtwo_sdk` binary implementing the `v2_sdk_service`. This is triggered by a crafted payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `my_tcp_receive` function in `libv2_sdk.so` performs an unsafe memory write operation, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This allows an attacker to overwrite a pointer in the process memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to a memory information leak or arbitrary code execution on the `v2_sdk_service` running on the drone.
- **Attack vectors:** An adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted payload to the affected service on port 10000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device and needs to send a crafted payload to trigger the vulnerability. The CVSS score indicates that user interaction is required and that the attacker needs to have low privileges.
