|  | In OPC UA, the address space refers to the data made available by the server to the client. |
| --- | --- |
|  | There are two levels of security involved. |
|  | The first level is the secure channel, which encompasses encryption, signature, and application authentication. |
|  | Howerver, Asyncua did not implement it for version concerned by this vulnerability. |
|  | The second layer of security is related to user authentication and authorization. However, |
|  | utilizing this second layer was found to be unnecessary since all services reserved for authenticated |
|  | clients could be accessed without employing the second layer of security. |
|  |  |
|  | To sum up, anyone who knows the ip address of the server is able to access all data (if the server is running a vulnerable version). |
|  |  |
|  | #How was the vulnerability discovered ? |
|  | During my experiments for my Ph.D., I identified this vulnerability and promptly alerted the maintainers |
|  | by creating an issue on Git, as their request. |
|  |  |
|  | #Reproduce: |
|  | To reproduce this vulnerability: |
|  | 0/send hello message |
|  | 1/create a secure channel (without encryption and without signature), |
|  | 2/create session (no authentication required, activating a session is the operation that is used for authentication). |
|  | 3/use services provided by the server |
|  |  |
|  | All of this is described in the issue |
|  | https://github.com/FreeOpcUa/opcua-asyncio/issues/1014 |
