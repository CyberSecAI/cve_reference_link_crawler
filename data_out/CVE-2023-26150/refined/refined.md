Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks for services that require an active session in the `asyncua` library. This allows access to the address space without proper authentication. Specifically, the second layer of security (user authentication and authorization) was not enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks for services that should require an active session. This bypasses the intended security mechanisms and grants unauthorized access.
-   **Missing Session Checks:** The code did not verify if a session was activated before allowing access to certain services, meaning any client could interact with the server if it knew its IP address and bypassed the intended authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers could gain complete access to all data made available by the server, potentially including sensitive information.
-  **Data Modification**: Attackers could potentially modify data, although the attacker doesn't have control over what or how much is modified.
-   **Lack of Confidentiality:** The vulnerability leads to some loss of confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access to restricted information.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. An attacker needs to know the IP address of the vulnerable server.
-   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability does not require any user interaction for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the vulnerable server.
-   **Knowledge of Server IP Address:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the OPC UA server using the vulnerable `asyncua` library.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability as they can bypass the authentication layer

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during experiments for a Ph.D.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.9.96 of the `asyncua` library.
- The fix involves implementing checks for services that require an active session.
- The vulnerability was reported to the maintainers of the library through a GitHub issue.
- The Snyk vulnerability database entry provides a CVSS score of 6.5, while NVD gives it a score of 7.5 (High).
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-287 (Improper Authentication).
- The exploit is considered to have a low attack complexity and requires no privileges.
- The vulnerability was fixed by pull request #1015, which checks if a session is activated before granting access to services.

In summary, CVE-2023-26150 in the `asyncua` library is due to missing authentication checks, allowing unauthorized network access to server data, which is fixed in version 0.9.96.
