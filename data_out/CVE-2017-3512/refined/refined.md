Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) component of Java SE. Specifically, it's triggered during the processing of untrusted data, likely related to graphics or UI elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The AWT component fails to properly validate the data it receives when handling graphics or UI operations. This lack of validation leads to a vulnerability.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system, potentially gaining complete control. The attacker can gain the same privileges as the user running the Java application.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact is rated high for all three aspects. A successful attack can expose sensitive information, modify critical data, and/or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be initiated over a network.
- **Multiple Protocols:** The vulnerability can be exploited via multiple protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring user credentials.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required for exploitation when using sandboxed applications (applets, web start). No interaction is required when APIs of the component are used directly, such as through web services.
- **Untrusted code:** The vulnerability applies to systems that load and run untrusted code.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Java SE versions 7u131 and 8u121.
*   The risk matrix entry has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.3
*   The provided oracle document states, "This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security." It also mentions that "This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator)."
*   Gentoo also mentions that IcedTea is affected by this issue.
