- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation that can lead to arbitrary code execution in System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local authenticated malicious user can gain arbitrary code execution in SMRAM, potentially leading to system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a local authenticated user to send a specially crafted System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be local and have authentication privileges on the affected system.
