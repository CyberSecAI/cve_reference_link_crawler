- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Floating Action Button Plugin <= 1.2.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is achieved by tricking a logged-in user to perform actions they did not intend to, via a crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to perform the unwanted actions. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
