Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-31847:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-31847

**Vulnerability Description:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') - CWE-79

**Software Version:** Italtel Embrace 1.6.4

**Root Cause:** The Italtel Embrace web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in HTTP pages. Specifically, it lacks proper input validation, allowing injection of arbitrary Javascript code, which is then stored and reflected in the Activity Log page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the application's data, leading to its execution when a user views the affected page. This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation and output encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to critical data or achieve complete account takeover by injecting malicious code that executes within the user's session.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to malicious code execution in a user's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP/GET Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific URL with malicious JavaScript code within parameters that are subsequently logged. The injection can occur both pre- and post-authentication, suggesting that both authenticated and unauthenticated users can be impacted by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in the following URL: `https://[HOST]/[NODE-NAME]/supervoip/api/v1/logTrace/buttonViewLogTrace/[ANY-STRING]/<img%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.cookie"))>/it`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the Italtel Embrace application.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of web security vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious JavaScript payloads.
*   No authentication is required.

**Technical Details**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a JavaScript payload, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie")>`, within a URL parameter.
*   The injected script gets stored and executed when the Activity Log page is loaded.
*   The vulnerability affects every functionality that generates log entries in the Activity Log.
