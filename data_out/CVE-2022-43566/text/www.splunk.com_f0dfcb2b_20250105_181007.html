# Risky command safeguards bypass via Search ID query in Analytics Workspace in Splunk Enterprise

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2022-1106

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2022-43566](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43566)

**Published:** 2022-11-02

**Last Update:** 2022-11-02

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

**Bug ID:** SPL-223730

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.2.9, 8.1.12, and 9.0.2, an authenticated user can run risky commands using a more privileged user’s permissions to bypass [SPL safeguards for risky commands](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards) in the Analytics Workspace. The vulnerability requires the attacker to phish the victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The attacker cannot exploit the vulnerability at will.

## Solution

For Splunk Enterprise, upgrade versions to 8.1.12, 8.2.9, 9.0.2, or higher.

For Splunk Cloud Platform, Splunk is actively patching and monitoring the Splunk Cloud instances.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.1 | Splunk Web | 8.1.11 and lower | 8.1.12 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.2 | Splunk Web | 8.2.0 to 8.2.8 | 8.2.9 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.1 | 9.0.2 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform |  | Splunk Web | 9.0.2205 and lower | 9.0.2208 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

The vulnerability affects instances with the Analytics Workspace enabled. Disabling the Analytics Workplace application is a possible workaround. For more information on managing apps, see [Manage app and add-on objects](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Managingappobjects).

The vulnerability affects instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) enabled, disabling Splunk Web is a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on disabling Splunk Web.

## Detections

* [Splunk Data exfiltration from Analytics Workspace using sid query](https://research.splunk.com/application/b6d77c6c-f011-4b03-8650-8f10edb7c4a8/)

This detection search lets operators discover attempts to exfiltrate data by bypassing search ID queries in Analytics Workspace in Splunk Enterprise versions 8.2.9, 8.1.12, and 9.0.2.

## Severity

Splunk rates the vulnerability as High, 7.3, with CVSS Vectors of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N.

The vulnerability requires both the compromise of a user’s account and user interaction within a browser of a higher privileged user. The vulnerability lets an attacker run risky commands with permissions of a highly privileged user. For more information on risky commands and potential impacts, see [SPL safeguards for risky commands](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards).

If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there is no impact and the severity is Informational.
