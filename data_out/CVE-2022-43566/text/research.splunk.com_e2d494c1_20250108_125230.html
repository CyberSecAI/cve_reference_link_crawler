# Detection: Splunk Data exfiltration from Analytics Workspace using sid query

### Description

The following analytic identifies attempts to exfiltrate data by executing a prepositioned malicious search ID in Splunk's Analytic Workspace. It leverages the `audit_searches` data source to detect suspicious `mstats` commands indicative of injection attempts. This activity is significant as it may indicate a phishing-based attack where an attacker compels a victim to initiate a malicious request, potentially leading to unauthorized data access. If confirmed malicious, this could result in significant data exfiltration, compromising sensitive information and impacting the organization's security posture.

### Search

```
1`audit_searches` info=granted search NOT ("audit_searches") search NOT ("security_content_summariesonly") AND ((search="*mstats*[*]*" AND provenance="N/A") OR (search="*mstats*\\\"*[*]*\\\"*"))
2| eval warning=if(match(search,"\\\\\""), "POTENTIAL INJECTION STAGING", "POTENTIAL INJECTION EXECUTION")
3| table search, user, warning, timestamp
4| `splunk_data_exfiltration_from_analytics_workspace_using_sid_query_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [audit\_searches](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/audit_searches.yml) | `index=_audit sourcetype=audittrail action=search` |
| splunk\_data\_exfiltration\_from\_analytics\_workspace\_using\_sid\_query\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_data_exfiltration_from_analytics_workspace_using_sid_query_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

The vulnerability affects only instances with Splunk Web Enabled. After running this search, please run "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky SPL MLTK" to gain more insight into potentially risky commands which could lead to data exfiltration.

### Known False Positives

This search may produce false positives. This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the \_audit index. Special attention must be paid to "/en-US/app/search/analytics\_workspace?sid=[sid]" which is where the malicious code will be inserted to trigger attack at victim.

### Associated Analytic Story

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential data exfiltration attack using SID query by $user$ | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
