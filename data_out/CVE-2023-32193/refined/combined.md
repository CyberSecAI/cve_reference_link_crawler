# XSS Vulnerability in Norman API

>= 7b2b467 (release/v2.7.s3)
>= bd13c65 (release/v2.6)

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been identified in which unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) in Norman's public API endpoint can be exploited. This can lead to an attacker exploiting the vulnerability to trigger JavaScript code and execute commands remotely.

The attack vector was identified as a Reflected XSS.

Norman API propagates malicious payloads from user input to the UI, which renders the output. For example, a malicious URL gets rendered into a script that is executed on a page.

The changes addressed by this fix are:

* Encode input that comes from the request URL before adding it to the response.
* The request input is escaped by changing the URL construction that is used for links to use `url.URL`.
* The request input is escaped by escaping the JavaScript and CSS variables with attribute encoding as defined by [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#output-encoding-rules-summary).

### Workarounds

There is no direct mitigation besides updating Norman API to a patched version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
