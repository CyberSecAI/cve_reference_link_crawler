- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Analytify Plugin versions 5.2.3 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on their behalf, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, forces them to unknowingly perform an action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a higher privileged user to trigger a crafted request while they are authenticated on the vulnerable website.
