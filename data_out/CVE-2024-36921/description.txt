In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: guard against invalid STA ID on removal

Guard against invalid station IDs in iwl_mvm_mld_rm_sta_id as that would
result in out-of-bounds array accesses. This prevents issues should the
driver get into a bad state during error handling.
