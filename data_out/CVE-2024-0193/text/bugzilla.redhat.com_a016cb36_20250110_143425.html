| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2255653#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-12-22 18:42:28 UTC  ``` A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered within the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. If the catchall element is garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice. This causes a use-after-free on an NFT_CHAIN object or NFT_OBJECT object. A local unprivileged user could use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges on the system.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2255653#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-02 11:00:19 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2256447](show_bug.cgi?id=2256447 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-0193 kernel: netfilter: use-after-free in nft_trans_gc_catchall_sync leads to privilege escalation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2255653#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-01-02 11:00:46 UTC  ``` Upstream patch (Netfilter tree): <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netfilter/nf.git/commit/?id=7315dc1e122c85ffdfc8defffbb8f8b616c2eb1a>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2255653#c13)  Justin M.
