Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability CVE-2017-3289:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure class construction within the Hotspot component of OpenJDK, which allows bypassing Java sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure class construction
- Bypass of Java sandbox restrictions

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker could use this flaw to completely bypass Java sandbox restrictions, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution, unauthorized access to data, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the insecure class construction within the Hotspot component. Specifically, an untrusted Java application or applet could leverage this flaw. It's indicated in the Red Hat Security Advisory that the issues exposed via Java applets could have been exploited without user interaction if a user visited a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Java application or applet that leverages the insecure class construction. They may use a malicious website or a compromised system to deliver this payload. The user is required to execute a malicious java application or a java applet that uses the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects multiple products, as can be seen from the Red Hat security advisories. Both IBM and OpenJDK implementations are impacted.
-  The vulnerability is classified as critical due to the high potential impact.
- The Red Hat advisory indicates that whitelists for deserialization were introduced as part of the fixes to prevent untrusted classes from being deserialized by RMI registry or DCG.

The Debian security advisory also mentions the vulnerability as part of a batch of flaws in OpenJDK that could lead to sandbox bypass and arbitrary code execution.
