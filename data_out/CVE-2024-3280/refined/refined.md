Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `wpsite_follow_us_badges` shortcode within the Follow Us Badges plugin lacks proper input sanitization and output escaping for user-supplied attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-provided shortcode attributes, allowing malicious code to be injected.
*   **Missing Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of these attributes when rendering the HTML, leading to the execution of the injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to various attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing, and defacement.
*   **Compromised User Data:** The injected scripts could steal user information, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can insert malicious JavaScript via shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Requires an account with Contributor-level access or higher, which can create or edit posts.
*   **Content Creation/Editing Access:** Ability to create or edit posts or pages where the vulnerable shortcode can be injected.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability is present due to the following reasons:

1.  The plugin doesn't sanitize user-supplied attribute values in the `wpsite_follow_us_badges` shortcode.
2.  The plugin does not properly escape these attribute values when rendering them in the HTML.
3. The injected code can be stored in the database and executed whenever the page containing the shortcode is accessed by any site visitor.

The provided files primarily show the changes introduced in version 3.1.11, which addresses the security vulnerability mentioned. These include changes to the plugin's admin settings and the core plugin file. However, the specific sanitization and escaping changes are not clearly outlined within the changeset itself. The changelog mentions "Security Enhancements" and "important security fixes". The Wordfence article provides details of the stored XSS vulnerability but doesn't go into technical specifics of the exploited code.

The Wordfence article is more specific in describing the vulnerability type as stored XSS and specifies that this is caused by improper sanitization and output escaping. It specifies that any authenticated user with contributor access or higher can exploit this.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
