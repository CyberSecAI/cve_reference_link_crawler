```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ajaxGetFileByPath.php` script in rConfig 3.9.4 does not perform adequate validation or sanitization on the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Insufficient input validation",
     "Lack of proper checksumming"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests, potentially to internal resources not exposed to the public network, read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, and potentially probe internal web services. This allows for information disclosure and may enable further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted GET request with a malicious URL in the `path` parameter to the vulnerable `ajaxGetFileByPath.php` script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated to the rConfig application. They must also have network access to the server running the application. An attacker can send a GET request with a malicious `path` parameter value to the vulnerable `ajaxGetFileByPath.php` endpoint."
