#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. As a user without script or programming right, put a Groovy macro with content

```
{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger("attacker").error("Hello from Groovy!"){{/groovy}}
```

in the about section of the user profile.

2. As admin, notice the malicious code and disable the user profile to prevent further actions by the user. Reload the user profile.

**Expected result:**

No Groovy code is executed.

**Actual result:**

A log message Hello from Groovy! is displayed, showing that the Groovy macro has been executed.

This seems to be a regression introduced by [~~XWIKI-17591~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17591 "Wrong author in history when disabling a user account"), there considered as a feature.

CVSS 9.0 (Critical): <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H> (but not that trivially exploitable)
