{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The firmware upload process lacks proper authentication, allowing attackers to send arbitrary firmware fragments without verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Access Control",
      "Lack of authentication for firmware upload"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload modified firmware containing malicious code, leading to a fully compromised device. Legitimate firmware updates may also be rendered impossible.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Sending malicious firmware fragments via POST requests to the `/maintenance/fwupgrade.cgi` endpoint."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send HTTP POST requests."
