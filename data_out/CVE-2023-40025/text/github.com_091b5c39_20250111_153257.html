# Web terminal session doesn't expire

Moderate

[crenshaw-dev](/crenshaw-dev)
published
GHSA-c8xw-vjgf-94hr
Aug 23, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

2.6.0 through 2.6.13, 2.7.11, 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.6.14, 2.7.12, 2.8.1

## Description

### Impact

All versions of Argo CD starting from v2.6.0 have a bug where open web terminal sessions do not expire. This bug allows users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the terminal view and leaves it open for an extended period. This allows the user to view sensitive information even when they should have been logged out already.

### Patches

A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD version:

* v2.6.14
* v2.7.12
* v2.8.1

### Workarounds

The only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.

#### Mitigations

Disable web-based terminal or define RBAC rules to it

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
