- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the installer of the Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer does not properly validate input, allowing for a denial-of-service attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user with local access can trigger a denial of service on the affected system by exploiting the input validation vulnerability in the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An authenticated user must be able to interact with the installer on the local machine. The user needs to trigger the installer with a specially crafted input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the targeted Windows machine and must be able to run the Zoom Workplace Desktop application installer. The user also needs to be able to trigger the vulnerability with the required input.
