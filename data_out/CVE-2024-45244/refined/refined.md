Based on the provided content, this commit introduces a new authentication filter called `TimeWindowCheck`. This filter validates the timestamp of a proposal against a configurable time window.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is not present in this commit, rather this commit is a fix. The commit addresses a potential issue where proposals with timestamps outside of a valid time window could be processed. This commit adds a check to ensure that the timestamp in a proposal is within a configured time window, preventing the processing of proposals with invalid timestamps.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Absence of timestamp validation before this commit, which could lead to processing of old or future proposals.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Before the fix, an attacker could potentially submit proposals with manipulated timestamps.
*  With the fix in place, proposals outside the allowed time window will be rejected, preventing the processing of invalid transactions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker would need to submit a crafted proposal with a timestamp outside of the configured `authenticationTimeWindow`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and submit proposals to the peer. This typically requires some level of access to the network and understanding of the proposal structure.

**Technical Details**
*   A new filter `TimeWindowCheck` is added, which is configured using `peer.authentication.timewindow` (default 15 minutes).
*   The filter validates the proposal timestamp, using UTC time, against the current time, ensuring the timestamp falls within the specified `timeWindow`.
*   If validation fails, the proposal processing is stopped and an error is returned.
*   The filter is integrated into the peer's authentication process.

**Additional Notes**
*   The commit also modifies configuration loading and adds test cases.
*   The primary focus is on preventing the processing of proposals with invalid timestamps.
*  This commit prevents replay attacks where previously valid proposals are submitted after their window of validity has expired.
