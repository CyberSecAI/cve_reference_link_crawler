- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cleartext storage of sensitive passwords within firmware update packages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Passwords for operating system and web application users are stored in cleartext within the firmware update package (APS zip archive).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can access various appliance services using hardcoded credentials extracted from the firmware package. This can lead to full compromise of the device including Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the firmware update package can extract the cleartext passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to obtain a copy of the firmware update package (APS zip archive). This may be done by intercepting an update, or by internal access to a storage point.
