Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28345:

**1. Verification:**

The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-28345" and describes an "RTLO Injection URI Spoofing" vulnerability in the Signal iOS client, which aligns with the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Signal iOS client's incorrect rendering of RTLO (Right-to-Left Override) encoded URLs. Specifically, the client fails to properly sanitize URLs that:
    *   Begin with a non-breaking space.
    *   Contain a hash (#) character.
    *   Lack the `http` or `https` scheme.

This allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that, when rendered by the Signal client, display a completely different (and often legitimate-looking) URL to the user.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **RTLO Injection:** The core vulnerability is the misuse of the RTLO control character which causes a reversal in the display of text, this can be leveraged to create deceptive URLs.
*   **Inadequate URL Parsing/Sanitization:** The Signal iOS client doesn't properly parse and sanitize URLs containing RTLO characters and specific formatting (non-breaking space, # character and lack of schema) before rendering them, leading to a spoofed display of the URL.
*  **Bypass Previous Fixes:** The inclusion of the `#` character caused the Signal client to hyperlink the entire URL which bypasses previous fixes for similar vulnerabilities.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **URI Spoofing/Phishing:** Attackers can create links that appear to point to legitimate websites but actually direct users to malicious sites.
*   **Social Engineering Attacks:** The spoofed URLs can be used to trick users into divulging sensitive information, downloading malware, or performing other unwanted actions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Messages:** The primary attack vector is through malicious messages sent via the Signal application.
*   **Any client:** The malicious messages can be sent via any other client that is able to send messages to Signal iOS clients.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not require any authentication to send the malicious messages.
*   **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker only needs the ability to send messages to Signal users.
*   **Crafted URLs:** The attacker must be able to generate URLs using the specific RTLO character, non-breaking space, a `#` character and remove `http` or `https`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit leverages the fact that the Signal client renders URLs beginning with a non-breaking space and a hash character automatically as hyperlinks and automatically uses the top level domain after the last forward slash for display purposes.
* The exploit only affects the iOS Signal client, but can be sent from any other client.
*  The vulnerability was fixed in Signal iOS client version 5.34.
* The exploit makes use of common top-level domains (TLD) such as .com to disguise the attack.
