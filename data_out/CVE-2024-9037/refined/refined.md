Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `index.php` file of the "Internal Marks Calculation In PHP With Source Code" application.
- The root cause is the insufficient validation of the 'tid' parameter, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the 'tid' parameter of index.php.
- Lack of input sanitization or validation before incorporating the 'tid' parameter into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering (modification or deletion).
- Potential for complete system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the 'tid' parameter within the HTTP POST request.
- The application directly uses the untrusted data from the 'tid' parameter in SQL queries, leading to the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests with a malicious 'tid' parameter.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using different techniques: boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided payloads showcase these techniques:
    - Boolean-based blind injection uses a conditional statement to infer if the injection is working.
    - Error-based injection triggers database errors to reveal information.
    - Time-based blind injection uses time delays (using SLEEP) to confirm SQL execution.
- SQLmap tool can be used for automated exploitation.

**Suggested Repair:**
- Use parameterized queries and prepared statements.
- Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
- Grant minimal database privileges.
- Regularly perform security audits.
