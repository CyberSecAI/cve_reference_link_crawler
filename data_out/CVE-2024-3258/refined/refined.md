Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `add_activity.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System. Specifically, the `title`, `description`, `start`, and `end` parameters received via POST requests are directly incorporated into an SQL query without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input for the vulnerable parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can bypass normal access controls and perform unauthorized queries to access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Database Manipulation:** By injecting SQL commands, attackers could gain complete control of the database server itself, which includes administrative tasks such as schema modification or even operating system level commands in certain configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `add_activity.php` file. Specifically, by modifying the parameters in POST requests, an attacker can inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `add_activity.php` page of the application.
*   The attacker needs to know the application is vulnerable and how to formulate malicious SQL queries.
*   The attacker would typically need to be authenticated with administrative privileges to access this functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet in `add_activity.php` is:
    ```php
    if(ISSET($_POST['save_activity'])){
        $title = $_POST['title'];
        $description = $_POST['description'];
        $start = $_POST['start'];
        $end = $_POST['end'];
        $month = date("M", strtotime($_POST['start']));
        $year = date("Y", strtotime($_POST['start']));
        $conn->query("INSERT INTO `activity` VALUES('', '$title', '$description', '$start', '$end', '$month', '$year')") or die($conn->error);
        header('location: activity.php');
    }
    ```
*   The provided SQLMap output demonstrates that the `title`, `description`, `start`, and `end` parameters are all vulnerable to SQL injection using both boolean-based blind and error-based techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable application is "Internship Portal Management System" version 1.0
*   The identified vulnerability is in the `admin/add_activity.php` file.
