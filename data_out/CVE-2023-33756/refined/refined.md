- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SpreadSheetPlugin's EVAL feature allows the evaluation of formulas using the Perl `eval` function. Insufficient filtering of input to the `eval` function allows for execution of file globbing and path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insufficient input sanitization of the formula passed to the `eval` function, allowing for execution of Perl code (specifically file globbing).
    - Path traversal vulnerability due to the ability to use `../` sequences in the formula.
    - Regex substitution of "ee" with "e" that allows disclosure of files starting with "e".
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain information about the server, including paths and file names on the server's file system.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific formula using the EVAL feature, an attacker can trigger the execution of file globbing, allowing listing of files and directories on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the SpreadSheetPlugin's EVAL feature, which is accessible without authentication on the demo page.
