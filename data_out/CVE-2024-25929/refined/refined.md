- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to have any special capabilities or be in a specific position to exploit the vulnerability. They just need to be an unauthenticated user of the website using the vulnerable plugin.
