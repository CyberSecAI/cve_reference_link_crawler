Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45178:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper user input validation in the C-MOR Video Surveillance software. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize user-provided file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The application is vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient validation of user input, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the C-MOR system as the Linux user "www-data". This could lead to the exposure of sensitive system files, configuration data, or potentially other user data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to specific scripts within the C-MOR web interface:
    - The `download-bkf.pml` script is vulnerable through the `bkf` parameter.
    - The `show-movies.pml` script is also vulnerable through the `cam` parameter.
- By supplying relative paths such as `../../../../etc/passwd` as the value for these parameters, an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the C-MOR system, i.e., they need valid credentials to log in to the web interface.
- Network access to the C-MOR web interface is necessary to send the malicious requests.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in C-MOR Video Surveillance version 5.2401.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.00PL1.
- The advisory provides a proof of concept using `curl` to demonstrate the attack by downloading `/etc/passwd`.
- The vulnerability is classified as a high risk.
