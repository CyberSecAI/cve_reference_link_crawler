The provided content describes CVE-2020-17360, as well as CVE-2020-25021, CVE-2020-25022 and CVE-2020-25023 which are related vulnerabilities.

**CVE-2020-17360**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflows in the `vm::arrayCopy` method within the Avian JVM.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   The code performs boundary checks using `srcOffset + length <= sl` and `dstOffset + length <= dl`, where `sl` and `dl` are the source and destination array lengths respectively.
    *   Integer overflow in the addition of `offset + length` can bypass these checks, as a large positive integer added to another can result in a small positive or even negative number that would pass the length checks.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Out-of-bounds read or write in JVM memory.
    *   Potential for denial of service, memory disclosure, or arbitrary code execution in the context of the JVM.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Calling `System.arraycopy` with a large `dstOffset` value such as `0x7fffffff`, along with a length value, that will cause an integer overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Ability to execute Java code within the Avian JVM.

**CVE-2020-25022**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient boundary checks in `AESGCMFallbackCipherState.encryptWithAd()` method in Noise-Java.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing or incomplete checks on `plaintextOffset`, `ciphertextOffset`, and `length` parameters when copying data.
    *   The check `if (ciphertextOffset > ciphertext.length)` is bypassed with negative `ciphertextOffset`.
    *   A negative `ciphertextOffset` would increase the available space instead of decreasing it, thus bypassing length checks.
    *   `plaintextOffset` is never checked, leading to potential OOB reads.
    *   Negative length values are not handled correctly, potentially leading to OOB read/write or silent returns.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Out-of-bounds read/write, silent return, or JVM exceptions.
    *   Potential for memory disclosure, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data loss.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Calling `encryptWithAd` with invalid `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Ability to call the vulnerable method within Noise-Java.

**CVE-2020-25021**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient boundary checks in `ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd()` method in Noise-Java.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Similar to CVE-2020-25022, this vulnerability involves missing or incomplete checks on `plaintextOffset`, `ciphertextOffset`, and `length` during data copying.
    *   The check `if (ciphertextOffset > ciphertext.length)` is bypassed with negative `ciphertextOffset`.
    *    A negative `ciphertextOffset` would increase the available space instead of decreasing it, thus bypassing length checks.
    *   `plaintextOffset` is not checked, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads.
    *   Negative length values are not correctly handled, leading to potential OOB read/write or silent returns.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Same impact as CVE-2020-25022: Out-of-bounds read/write, silent return, or JVM exceptions.
    *   Potential for memory disclosure, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data loss.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Same as CVE-2020-25022: Calling `encryptWithAd` with invalid `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Ability to call the vulnerable method within Noise-Java.

**CVE-2020-25023**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient boundary checks in `AESGCMOnCtrCipherState.encryptWithAd()` method in Noise-Java.
*    **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *    Same as CVE-2020-25022 and CVE-2020-25021, this vulnerability involves missing or incomplete checks on `plaintextOffset`, `ciphertextOffset`, and `length` during data copying.
    *   The check `if (ciphertextOffset > ciphertext.length)` is bypassed with negative `ciphertextOffset`.
     *   A negative `ciphertextOffset` would increase the available space instead of decreasing it, thus bypassing length checks.
    *   `plaintextOffset` is never checked, which could lead to out-of-bounds reads.
    *   Negative length values are not handled correctly, which could lead to OOB read/write or silent returns.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *  Same as CVE-2020-25022 and CVE-2020-25021: Out-of-bounds read/write, silent return, or JVM exceptions.
    *   Potential for memory disclosure, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data loss.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Same as CVE-2020-25022 and CVE-2020-25021: Calling `encryptWithAd` with invalid `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Ability to call the vulnerable method within Noise-Java.
