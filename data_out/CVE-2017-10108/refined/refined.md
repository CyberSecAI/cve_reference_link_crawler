{
  "CVE-2017-10108": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization of a BasicAttribute object.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `BasicAttribute` class in the Serialization component of OpenJDK does not limit the amount of memory allocated during deserialization, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious serialized input stream to trigger excessive memory consumption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a partial denial of service by triggering excessive memory allocation in the target Java application, which may lead to application instability or crashes.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network by sending a specially crafted serialized input stream to a Java application that processes `BasicAttribute` objects, through methods like web services or RMI.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious serialized input stream to a Java application, which doesn't require any privileges or user interaction."
