```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check after calling `findKey` in `Exiv2::Internal::resolveLens0x319`. If `findKey` does not find a matching key, it returns `end()`, which if dereferenced, leads to a null pointer dereference.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Null pointer dereference (CWE-476)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit leads to a denial of service due to the null pointer dereference.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring the user to run Exiv2 on a crafted image file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted image file to the user, tricking them into running `exiv2` with the `-p t` or `-P t` option on that file."
