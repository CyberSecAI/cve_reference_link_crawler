### @kevinbackhouse **[kevinbackhouse](/kevinbackhouse)** commented [Jul 3, 2021](#issue-936333829)

Fixes [GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w "GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w")

The bug is that [this call to `findKey`](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/blob/8120ff7784100e1c4c07ce203d7a6c6aebe5fb2d/src/pentaxmn_int.cpp#L1340) might not find anything, but the iterator still gets dereferenced. Every call to `findKey` should always be followed by a check that the iterator doesn't equal `end()`.

I used a CodeQL query to find other instances of the same bug and fixed them too.

Sorry, something went wrong.
