- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data when exporting to CSV or SLK files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Formula injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Client-side Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks by leveraging spreadsheet features like DDE.
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks (depending on spreadsheet software).
    - Cross-spreadsheet data exfiltration.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Creation of a malicious asset with a crafted title containing an injection payload.
    - Exporting the asset data to a spreadsheet (CSV or SLK).
    - Opening the exported file in a spreadsheet application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - A technician level account in GLPI, which allows creation or editing of assets.
    - Ability to input a malicious payload into a title field.
