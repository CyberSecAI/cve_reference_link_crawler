- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `webPrivateDecrypt` function in the HTTPD binary of multiple ZTE routers does not validate the length of the decrypted data before storing it on the stack. The function decrypts RSA encrypted ciphertext provided in base64 encoded format.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to insufficient bounds checking when writing decrypted data to a stack buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root by sending crafted data to trigger the overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the HTTP server of the router. An attacker needs to send a crafted base64 encoded ciphertext to the `webPrivateDecrypt` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the router's HTTP server. No authentication is needed.
