| SUMMARY Kasma Technologies Inc’s KasmaVNC component is affected by a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to browse the underlaying filesystem files (more commonly known as Directory Traversal). AFFECTED PRODUCTS KasmaVNC. Confirmed in version 1.3.1.230e50f7b89663316c70de7b0e3db6f6b9340489. Other previous versions might also be affected.

This could potentially allow an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system, including application source code, configuration, and critical system files. Follow these guided steps to replicate the vulnerability:   1.

A CVE ID has been requested to MITRE and will update this thread once it has been assigned. IMPACT This behavior allows remote authenticated attackers able to reach the KasmaVNC server, to browse and read files on the remote filesystem. This also include the kasmpasswd file which includes all other user’s hashed passwords. |

### **[mmcclaskey](/mmcclaskey)** commented [Jun 13, 2024](#issuecomment-2165813229)

| Internal ticket KASM-6090 has been opened. It should be noted that, if confirmed, the bug requires authentication and since KasmVNC is running as the user that is authenticated, they would only be able to access files that they already have access to anyway. So it certainly would be a vulnerability, but the CVSS scoring should be adjusted to reflect those limitations. |

## A modern open source VNC server.

Enhanced security, higher compression, smoother encodingâ¦ all in a web-based client. Connect to your Linux server's desktop from any web browser. No client software install required.

 Launch Demo ![](/assets/images/arw.svg) [![](/assets/images/github.webp) ![](/assets/images/arw.svg)](https://github.com/kasmtech/KasmVNC) [Try out Cloud Personal for Individuals](/cloud-personal) ![](/assets/images/vasmvncBanner.webp)
## Web-Native, Secure and High-Performance

KasmVNC is the next generation open-source VNC Server.

 [Documentation ![](/assets/images/arw.svg)](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/index.html) [Release ![](/assets/images/arw.svg)](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/release_notes.html)Data Loss PreventionBetter CompressionSeamless ClipboardRobust AuthenticationClient Configurable
### Data Loss Prevention

### Data Loss Prevention

Rate limit and log both keystrokes and clipboard usage.

### Better Compression

### Better Compression

KasmVNC implements several new enhancements to decrease bandwidth. KasmVNC has added support for the webp image format, for up to 30% better compression. The addition of dynamic image quality provides for up to 20% better compression. Other features include scroll detection, multi-threaded encoding, and full screen video detection for optimizing the image when watching full screen video.

### Seamless Clipboard

### Seamless Clipboard

Seamlessly copy and paste between your local and remote system, on supported browsers.

### Robust Authentication

### Robust Authentication

KasmVNC uses username and password with unrestricted size and complexity. The VNC protocol by standard only supports a maximum of an 8 character password, which is insufficient for an internet facing server.

### Client Configurable

### Client Configurable

KasmVNC exposes more settings to the user, allowing the client to configure more aspects of the session.
