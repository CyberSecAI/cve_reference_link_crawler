 [Documentation ![](/assets/images/arw.svg)](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/index.html) [Release ![](/assets/images/arw.svg)](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc/docs/latest/release_notes.html)Data Loss PreventionBetter CompressionSeamless ClipboardRobust AuthenticationClient Configurable
### Data Loss Prevention

### Data Loss Prevention

Rate limit and log both keystrokes and clipboard usage.

### Better Compression

### Better Compression

KasmVNC implements several new enhancements to decrease bandwidth. KasmVNC has added support for the webp image format, for up to 30% better compression. The addition of dynamic image quality provides for up to 20% better compression. Other features include scroll detection, multi-threaded encoding, and full screen video detection for optimizing the image when watching full screen video.

### Seamless Clipboard

### Seamless Clipboard

Seamlessly copy and paste between your local and remote system, on supported browsers.

### Robust Authentication

### Robust Authentication

KasmVNC uses username and password with unrestricted size and complexity. The VNC protocol by standard only supports a maximum of an 8 character password, which is insufficient for an internet facing server.

### Client Configurable

### Client Configurable

KasmVNC exposes more settings to the user, allowing the client to configure more aspects of the session.
