Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `DB::raw()` in the `getFansLists()` function within `DistributionMemberLogic.php`. This function directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$user_id` derived from the `id` parameter of a GET request) into a raw SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. The ThinkPHP framework's ORM is bypassed by using `DB::raw()`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter of the `/admin/distribution_member/fans.html` endpoint.
    *   **Unvalidated Input:**  The application fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied data before incorporating it into the SQL query.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to:
        *   **Data Breaches:** Accessing sensitive data from the database, including user information, etc.
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Overloading the database server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/admin/distribution_member/fans.html` endpoint.
    *   **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter within the GET request is the vulnerable entry point.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   **Knowledge of the Endpoint:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/distribution_member/fans.html`).
    *   **Admin Access**: It seems like the attacker needs to be logged in as an admin since the vulnerable endpoint is under the `/admin` path.
    *   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
    * **AJAX Request**: The attacker needs to send the request using AJAX (X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest).

*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The application uses the ThinkPHP framework.
    *   The `DistributionMemberLogic.php` file is where the vulnerable code is located.
    *   The exploit can be performed with SQLmap using time-based blind injection.
    *   The provided CVSS score is 7.2/10 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
    *   The vulnerability exists in LikeShop versions prior to 2.5.7.
