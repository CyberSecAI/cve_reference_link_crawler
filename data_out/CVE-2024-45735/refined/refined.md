Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper Access Control: Low-privileged users, without "admin" or "power" roles in Splunk, can access sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Checks:** The Splunk Secure Gateway App lacks proper access controls, allowing low-privileged users to view sensitive data.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability exposes App Key Value Store (KV Store) deployment configurations and public/private keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive configuration data and cryptographic keys, leading to further attacks.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:**  Exposure of private keys and configuration information can compromise the security of the Splunk environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **Low-Privileged User Access:** Exploitation requires only a low-privileged user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Splunk User Account:** The attacker needs a valid, low-privileged user account on the affected Splunk instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Splunk instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Components:** Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Secure Gateway App.
*   **Specific Information Exposed:** The vulnerability exposes "App Key Value Store (KV Store) deployment configuration and public/private keys".
*   **Detection:** Splunk provides a detection query that can be used to identify potential exploitation attempts.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to the fixed versions, or if the functionality is not used, the app can be removed or disabled.
