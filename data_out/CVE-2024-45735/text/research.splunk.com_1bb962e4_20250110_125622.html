# Detection: Splunk SG Information Disclosure for Low Privs User

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 0a3d6035-7bef-4dfa-b01e-84349edac3b4
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.3.0, 9.2.1 and 9.1.6, and Splunk Secure Gateway versions on Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 3.4.259, 3.6.17, and 3.7.0, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles can see App Key Value Store (KV Store) deployment configuration and public/private keys in the Splunk Secure Gateway App.

### Search

```

### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [splunkd\_ui](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_ui.yml) | `index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd_ui_access` |
| splunk\_sg\_information\_disclosure\_for\_low\_privs\_user\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_sg_information_disclosure_for_low_privs_user_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and will produce false positives, the focus of this search must be on unusual requests towards the Splunk Secure Gateway from a non administrator user.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential exposure of Splunk Security Gateway sensitive information by $user$ | 40 | 80 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
