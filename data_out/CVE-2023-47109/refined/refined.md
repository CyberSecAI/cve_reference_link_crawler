Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2023-47109:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of file paths when adding and deleting blocks in the `blockreassurance` module. Specifically, when adding a block, a back-office (BO) user can manipulate the HTTP request to provide the path of any file on the server, instead of a path to an image. Subsequently, when deleting the block, the file at the specified path is deleted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal/Insecure File Handling:** The module doesn't properly validate or sanitize the file paths provided by the user, allowing them to specify arbitrary locations within the server's file system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of input validation, particularly on the file path provided when creating a new block.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker with back-office access can delete any file on the server that the webserver user has access to, including critical system files.
*   **Denial of Service:** By deleting essential files like `index.php`, the attacker can render the website completely unavailable.
*   **Potential Data Loss:** Deletion of other sensitive files can also result in data loss.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Back-Office Access:** The attacker must have legitimate access to the back-office of the PrestaShop application with sufficient permissions to modify the blockreassurance module.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests sent to the server. This can typically be done using browser developer tools or specialized tools.
