In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are 
stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete 
decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to 
decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on broadcast keys 
stored on the device.
