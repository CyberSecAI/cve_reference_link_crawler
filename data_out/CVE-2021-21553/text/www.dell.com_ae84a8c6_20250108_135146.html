#### Details

| **Proprietary Code CVEs** | **Description** | **CVSS Base Score** | **CVSS Vector String** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2021-21565 | Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 9.1.0.3 and earlier contain a denial of service vulnerability. SmartConnect had an error condition that may be triggered to loop, using CPU and potentially preventing other SmartConnect DNS responses. | 5.3 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L |
| CVE-2021-21553 | Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.0-9.1.0 contain an Incorrect User Management vulnerability. Under some specific conditions, this may allow the CompAdmin user to elevate privileges and break out of Compliance mode. This is a critical vulnerability and Dell recommends upgrading at the earliest. | 7.3 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
| CVE-2021-21562 | Dell PowerScale OneFS contains an untrusted search path vulnerability. This vulnerability may potentially allow a user with (ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_SSH or ISI\_PRIV\_LOGIN\_CONSOLE) and (ISI\_PRIV\_SYS\_UPGRADE or ISI\_PRIV\_AUDIT) to provide an untrusted path. This untrusted path can lead to run resources that are not under the application’s direct control. This vulnerability may also impacts clusters in Compliance mode. Dell recommends upgrading at the earliest opportunity. | 4.4 | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2021-21563 | Dell PowerScale OneFS versions 8.1.2-9.1.0.x contain an Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions in its auditing component. This may potentially allow an authenticated user with low-privileges to trigger a denial of service event. | 6.5 | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |
