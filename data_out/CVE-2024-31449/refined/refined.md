The provided content is related to CVE-2024-31449.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `bit.tohex` function of the Lua bit library used in Redis. The function does not properly handle the `INT_MIN` value when converting it to a hexadecimal string, leading to incorrect behavior and a potential overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- Improper handling of edge cases leading to unexpected behavior (CWE-20)
- Specifically, integer negation of `INT_MIN` results in the same value, causing issues in subsequent logic within the `bit.tohex` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated user can execute arbitrary code on the server through crafted Lua script.
- Potential for remote code execution (RCE).
- Could lead to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs to be an authenticated user to execute arbitrary Lua scripts.
- The vulnerable component is the Lua bit library within Redis.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be an authenticated user with the ability to execute Lua scripts within the Redis environment.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious Lua script.
