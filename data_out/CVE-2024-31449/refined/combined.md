# Lua library commands may lead to stack overflow and potential RCE

High

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-whxg-wx83-85p5
Oct 6, 2024

## Package

redis-server
(N/A)

## Affected versions

>= 2.8.18

## Patched versions

6.2.16, 7.2.6, 7.4.1

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user may use a specially crafted Lua script to trigger a stack buffer overflow in the bit library, which may potentially lead to remote code execution.

The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.16, 7.2.6, 7.4.1.

### Credit

The problem was reported by ankki-zsyang, Shenzhen Ankki Technologies Co.Ltd.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
