Root cause of vulnerability: The client secret, a critical credential, is exposed in the response of a network request within the "THE_B_members card" mini-app on Line.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Exposure of sensitive information (client secret) on the client-side.
- Insecure handling of API keys/secrets.

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can use the exposed client secret to obtain a channel access token.
- With the channel access token, attackers can send malicious broadcast messages (e.g., website links, fraud information) to users of the affected mini-app.
- Compromise of communication channel security within Line.

Attack vectors:
- Network request interception/inspection.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by simply opening the ‘THE_B_members card’ mini-app within the Line application.
- The client secret is exposed within the response of a specific network request to <https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry>.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to observe network traffic or have access to the client-side code of the Line mini-app.
- No special privileges are needed. The attacker only needs a Line app installation and to open the vulnerable mini-app.
