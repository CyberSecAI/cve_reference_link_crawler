Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47803:

**CVE-2024-47803:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of redaction of multi-line secret values within error messages generated by Jenkins when processing form submissions using the `secretTextarea` field.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the failure to sanitize or redact sensitive data (multi-line secrets) in error messages. The `secretTextarea` field is intended for handling secrets, but the system's error reporting mechanism inadvertently exposes these secrets.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive multi-line secrets by observing error messages, which might appear in system logs. This could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities, depending on the nature of the exposed secrets.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves submitting form data that includes multi-line secrets via the `secretTextarea` field and then triggering an error condition. The error message then reveals the secret.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to submit forms to Jenkins and cause an error to occur related to the secret field. The attacker needs to be a user with at least the ability to trigger form submissions with multi-line secrets. This is indicated by the CVSS vector `PR:L` (Low Privileges)
