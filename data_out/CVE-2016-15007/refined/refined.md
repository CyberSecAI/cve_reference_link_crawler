- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code was vulnerable to SOQL injection through the `orderDirection` parameter. Specifically, the `orderDirection` was being directly concatenated into the SOQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SOQL injection. The `orderDirection` parameter, coming from an external input, was not properly escaped.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could manipulate the SOQL query to extract sensitive data, modify data, or even cause denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `orderDirection` parameter sent to the `SObjectService.BuildSoqlString` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to control the value of the `orderDirection` parameter which is used to build the SOQL query string.

The provided content gives details about the vulnerability and the fix applied. The original code was vulnerable to SOQL injection because it did not properly escape the `orderDirection` parameter. The fix adds a `String.escapeSingleQuotes()` to escape the value before concatenating it into the SOQL query.
