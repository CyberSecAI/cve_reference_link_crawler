Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an enumeration issue on the password reset page of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The password reset page allows an attacker to determine if a given username is valid by observing differences in the response. This is a username enumeration vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can discover valid usernames on the Jira instance. This information can then be used for further attacks, such as brute-force login attempts or social engineering.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote and anonymous. An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability. They interact with the password reset page over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires network access to the Jira instance and no prior authentication is needed.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Versions before 8.5.10
*   Versions from 8.6.0 up to but not including 8.13.1

**Fixed Versions:**
* 8.5.10
* 8.13.1
