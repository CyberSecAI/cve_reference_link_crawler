Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-6040:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the `Data` parameter of MW6 Technologies' ActiveX controls for MaxiCode, Aztec, and DataMatrix barcode processing.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The ActiveX controls fail to properly validate the length of the input provided to the `Data` parameter, leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically:
    *   The `MW6Aztec` control overflows with a string larger than 9000 characters.
    *   The `MW6DataMatrix` control overflows with a string larger than 10000 characters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email) an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash of the web browser due to a read from address 41414141 after overflow in `MW6Aztec`.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is client-side, via malicious HTML documents.
    *   The attacker would need to convince a user to open/view a crafted HTML document. This could be via a website, HTML email, or attachment.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires the ability to create a malicious HTML document that includes the vulnerable ActiveX controls.
    *   The attacker needs to lure the victim into viewing the malicious document in a browser with the vulnerable ActiveX controls installed and enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `MW6Aztec` ActiveX control is associated with the CLSID `{F359732D-D020-40ED-83FF-F381EFE36B54}`. The `Aztec.dll` file is located in `C:\WINDOWS\system32\`.
*   The `MW6DataMatrix` ActiveX control is associated with the CLSID `{DE7DA0B5-7D7B-4CEA-8739-65CF600D511E}`. The `DATAMA~1.DLL` file is located in `C:\WINDOWS\system32\`.
*   The exploit for `MW6Aztec` shows the vulnerability crashes when trying to read from address `41414141`, indicating a controlled overwrite.
*   The `MW6DataMatrix` exploit results in an exploitable user-mode write access violation, but the exploitability of it was not fully confirmed.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 4, 0, 0, 1 of the controls.

**Additional Information:**

*   The CERT vulnerability note provides the CLSIDs and recommends disabling these controls via the kill bit in Internet Explorer or disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.3 (Base), which shows high severity due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2013-6040 is a high-severity vulnerability stemming from buffer overflows in MW6 Technologies' ActiveX controls, which could lead to remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted malicious HTML document.
