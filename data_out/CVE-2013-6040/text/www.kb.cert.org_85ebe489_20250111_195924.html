## MW6 Technologies ActiveX controls contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#219470

Original Release Date: 2014-01-20 | Last Revised: 2014-01-20

---

### Overview

MW6 Technologies' MaxiCode, Aztec, and DataMatrix ActiveX controls contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| MW6 Technologies' MaxiCode, Aztec, and DataMatrix ActiveX controls are used for processing barcodes. The ActiveX controls contain multiple vulnerabilities that may lead to remote code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, an HTML email message, or an HTML email attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause the web browser to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Disable the ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**  The vulnerable ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:     + {2355C601-37D1-42B4-BEB1-03C773298DC8} + {F359732D-D020-40ED-83FF-F381EFE36B54} + {DE7DA0B5-7D7B-4CEA-8739-65CF600D511E}  More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/publications/securing-your-web-browser#Internet_Explorer) document. |
