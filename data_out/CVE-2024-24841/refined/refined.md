    - Other harmful HTML payloads execution when guests visit the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's vulnerable code.
- An attacker would inject malicious scripts via a user input field or other means.
- When the website displays this unsanitized input, the attacker's script would execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into an input field or other exploitable area within the plugin's functionality.
- The user will need to be logged into the WordPress site as an administrator to be able to trigger the vulnerability.
