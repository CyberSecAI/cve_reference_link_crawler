- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory space. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations and can lead to critical impacts like arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, which allows the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including installing malware, stealing data, or taking control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed. The user interface interaction is required (UI:R), meaning user interaction is needed for exploitation
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable machine and the ability to make the user interact with the malicious input. The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N) for successful exploitation.
