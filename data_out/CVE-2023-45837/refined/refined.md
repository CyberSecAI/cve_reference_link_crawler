- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Ultimate Taxonomy Manager plugin (versions <= 2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts are executed when visitors access the compromised pages.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication. They simply need to be able to interact with the vulnerable input on the website.
