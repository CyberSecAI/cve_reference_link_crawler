- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF protection in the FrogCMS application when adding a layout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application does not validate the origin of the request when adding a layout via the `/admin/?/layout/add` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests to the application, in this case, adding a new layout with specified parameters. This could lead to various impacts depending on how the layout is used, potentially allowing arbitrary content injection or modification.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTML page containing a form that is automatically submitted to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/?/layout/add`). When a logged-in victim visits this attacker-controlled HTML page, their browser automatically makes the request without the victim's knowledge, creating a new layout on their FrogCMS instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page and induce a logged-in victim to visit it. The victim needs to have an active session with the vulnerable FrogCMS instance.
