In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Do not return negative stream id for array

[WHY]
resource_stream_to_stream_idx returns an array index and it return -1
when not found; however, -1 is not a valid array index number.

[HOW]
When this happens, call ASSERT(), and return a zero instead.

This fixes an OVERRUN and an NEGATIVE_RETURNS issues reported by Coverity.
