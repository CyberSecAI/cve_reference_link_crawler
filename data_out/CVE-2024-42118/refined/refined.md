The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the Linux kernel's AMD display driver, specifically within the `dc_resource.c` file. This issue is directly related to the description of the vulnerability where `resource_stream_to_stream_idx` can return -1.

**Root Cause:**

The function `resource_stream_to_stream_idx` could return -1 when a matching stream is not found. This return value is then used as an array index, which is invalid and can lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Negative Array Index:** The function `resource_stream_to_stream_idx` was returning -1, which when used as array index results in out of bounds access.
- **Potential Overrun:** The usage of a negative index could result in a read/write outside the bounds of the array if not handled correctly, potentially causing a crash or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash or Undefined Behavior:** The primary impact is a potential crash or undefined behavior of the system due to the memory corruption from accessing out of bounds of an array. 

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the `resource_stream_to_stream_idx` function fails to find a matching stream, resulting in a return value of -1. This can happen if the driver receives a display configuration request that is invalid or unexpected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker does not have direct control over the -1 return. This vulnerability occurs when the code is unable to map resources and there is no direct user input that results in the -1. However, this code can be reached by misconfigured display settings and could be triggered by an attacker that has control of the display configurations.
