- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "I Recommend This" versions <= 3.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the vulnerable website while authenticated. The specific impact can vary depending on the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that is then unknowingly executed by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing a crafted request. This does not require prior authentication as long as the targeted user is authenticated.
