Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a signed integer overflow in the `blkpg_do_ioctl` function within the Linux kernel's block layer. Specifically, the code was performing a sum of `p.start` and `p.length` without proper checks, and if this sum overflowed, it would become negative, potentially leading to other issues. The overflow occurred during a check that was intended to ensure that a partition's start and length were valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Signed Integer Overflow:** The core issue was the potential for a signed integer overflow when calculating `p.start + p.length`. This occurs because the kernel was using a signed long long integer and the values of `p.start` and `p.length` could combine such that they resulted in a negative value due to the overflow, bypassing the check.
- **Incorrect Validation Logic:**  The check `p.start + p.length < 0` was intended to detect an invalid partition range, but it was flawed because it relied on the overflow behavior to trigger, while the overflow was a bug.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/Crash:** The integer overflow was caught by the UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer), which is used for detecting undefined behaviors, indicating the original code would have resulted in a kernel panic.
- **Incorrect Partition Handling:** In a non-debug kernel build without UBSAN, this flaw could have led to incorrect handling of disk partitions due to the bypassed check, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior, data corruption, or other issues.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While this specific overflow was caught, such bugs are generally considered exploitable by an attacker with control over the input values and can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`BLKPG_ADD_PARTITION` ioctl:** This issue is triggered by the `BLKPG_ADD_PARTITION` ioctl call which takes a start and length of a partition in its arguments, which become the `p.start` and `p.length` variables.
- **User-Space Interaction:** An attacker with the ability to make ioctl calls on a block device can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific `p.start` and `p.length` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute ioctl calls on block devices on the system, which typically requires administrative privileges or a specific capability.
- The attacker also needs to know the required input arguments to trigger this vulnerability.

**Fix:**
The fix replaces the overflow-prone sum check with an equivalent check that doesn't cause an overflow:

```c
-if (p.start < 0 || p.length <= 0 || p.start + p.length < 0)
+if (p.start < 0 || p.length <= 0 || LLONG_MAX - p.length < p.start)
```
The new check `LLONG_MAX - p.length < p.start` achieves the same purpose without relying on overflow behavior which was triggering the UBSAN.
