Mattermost versions 9.8.x <= 9.8.0, 9.7.x <= 9.7.4, 9.6.x <= 9.6.2 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.5, when shared channels are enabled, fail to use constant time comparison for remote cluster tokens which allows an attacker to retrieve the remote cluster token via a timing attack during remote cluster token comparison.
