Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `type` parameter in the `admin/mod_settings/controller.php` file when the `action` is set to `add`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could modify or delete data, potentially compromising the integrity of the application and its data.
- **Potential for Complete System Takeover:** In some cases, SQL injection could be used to gain further control over the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `admin/mod_settings/controller.php?action=add`.
- **`type` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `type` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The GitHub content provides a detailed description of how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
- The SQL injection can be triggered by injecting SQL code into the `type` parameter.
- The vulnerability is present in the Aplaya Beach Resort Online Reservation System version 1.0.

**Payload Examples (from Github Content):**

*   **Boolean-based blind:**
    `DESCRIPTION= 1&save=&type=About' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (3535=3535) THEN 0x41626f7574 ELSE 0x28 END))-- Iuco`
*   **Error-based:**
    `DESCRIPTION= 1&save=&type=About' AND (SELECT 1555 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7162787171,(SELECT (ELT(1555=1555,1))),0x71717a7071,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- HiNC`
*   **Time-based blind:**
     `DESCRIPTION= 1&save=&type=About' AND (SELECT 8504 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))GfWx)-- BIPV`

These payloads demonstrate how an attacker can use different SQL injection techniques (boolean, error-based and time based) to exploit the vulnerability and extract information, using `sqlmap` tool, from the database.

The `vuldb.com` content confirms the information from the github content, adding that it is a critical vulnerability.
