Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-34583:

**Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs when the CODESYS V2 web server copies data from a 0x100-byte stack-based buffer to a heap-based communication buffer. The size of the copy operation is controlled by the attacker.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper bounds checking on the attacker-controlled copy size.
    *   Usage of `memcpy` without validating the size argument.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large copy size can cause a buffer over-read on the stack or a buffer over-write on the heap which can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** When configured with an external CODESYS Control runtime, a large copy size can leak stack contents over the network.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure, including an oversized `copy_size`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 2: Heap-based Buffer Over-read/Over-write**

*   **Root Cause:** The CODESYS V2 web server performs an in-place XOR-based encoding of user-supplied data. The length of the data to be encoded is controlled by the attacker and can exceed the actual size of the input data.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing validation of the attacker controlled encode length.
    *   In-place XOR encoding with insufficient bounds checking, leading to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Heap corruption due to out-of-bounds write can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific message structure containing a base64 encoded string to be decoded and an overly large encode length.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 3: Message |9 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|9'. The web server does not check the return value of `strchr` which may lead to a NULL pointer.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|9".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 4: Message |10 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|10'. Similar to the previous vulnerability, the web server does not check the result of `strchr`.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    * Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|10".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 5: Message |b or |e NULL Pointer Dereference**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message starting with '|b' or '|e'. Like before, the return value of `strchr` is not validated.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure starting with "|b" or "|e".
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 6: Message Parsing State 4 NULL Pointer Dereference**

*  **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference can occur when the web server processes a malformed message in parsing state 4, specifically when the `psHexNum` pointer is not initialized.
*   **Weaknesses:**
     *   Missing validation that the pointer `psHexNum` is not NULL.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference crashes the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a message that triggers the parsing state 4 and causes the `psHexNum` pointer to remain NULL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.

**Vulnerability 7: Message |6 Invalid Memory Access DoS**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory read access violation occurs when the web server processes a message starting with '|6', due to unchecked return value of `strchr` and path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Missing NULL check on the returned pointer from `strchr`.
    *   Path traversal vulnerability via file extension field.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory access violation due to the NULL pointer dereference can crash the web server or the CODESYS Control runtime system. Arbitrary file read when combined with path traversal.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Path Traversal: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the CODESYS V2 web server with a specific message structure that includes a path traversal sequence in the file extension field, causing it to read arbitrary files.
    *   Uploaded File: Uploading a file with message type 3 and then force the server to process the file content with a message of type 6.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send the crafted HTTP request.
