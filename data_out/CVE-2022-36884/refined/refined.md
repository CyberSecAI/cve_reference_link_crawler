Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36884:

**CVE-2022-36884**

*   **Root Cause:** The Git Plugin's webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` can be accessed without authentication using GET requests. Additionally, it discloses information about jobs, including those the user has no permission to access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authentication:** The webhook endpoint lacks authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to access it.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint's output reveals information about triggered or scheduled jobs, regardless of the user's permissions.
    *   **CSRF:** The endpoint accepts GET requests, which leads to a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can trigger builds of jobs configured with a specified Git repository, including forcing the build to use an attacker specified commit.
    *   An attacker can gain information about the existence of jobs configured with a given Git repository.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of a Git repository URL used in a Jenkins job.
    *   The attacker can send an unauthenticated GET request to the `/git/notifyCommit` endpoint.
    *   By using the `sha1` parameter, the attacker can force a specific commit checkout during the build.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any privileges, but requires knowledge of the Git repository URL used in Jenkins jobs.

**Additional Details:**

*   This vulnerability is associated with **SECURITY-284**, which also includes CVE-2022-36882 (CSRF) and CVE-2022-36883 (permission check).
*   The Git Plugin versions affected are 4.11.3 and earlier.
*   Version 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter that authorizes requests to the webhook endpoint.
