{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improperly sanitized input to the `id` parameter within the MailDecryptApplication interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This could result in a compromise of the application's data and possibly the underlying system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `MailDecryptApplication` interface, specifically the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the `MailDecryptApplication` interface, manipulating the `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads."
