## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CSSable Countdown <= 1.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/widgets.php
2. Add the "CSSable Countdown" widget
3. Under "Add Text" add the payload `</script><script>alert(1)</script>` to the "Event Description"
4. View the frontend and see the XSS
