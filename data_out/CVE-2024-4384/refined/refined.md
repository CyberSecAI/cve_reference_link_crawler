- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Event Description" field in the CSSable Countdown widget. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable widget. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker, with administrator privileges, injects the malicious JavaScript into the "Event Description" field of the "CSSable Countdown" widget via the WordPress admin panel, and this stored payload is then executed on the front end of the site by visitors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or other high privilege) on the WordPress site to add and configure widgets. The user does not need the unfiltered_html capability.
