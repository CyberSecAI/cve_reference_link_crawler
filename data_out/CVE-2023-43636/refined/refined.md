Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The "measured boot" mechanism in EVE OS does not validate the entire root file system (rootfs). It only verifies components like the BIOS configuration, GRUB, kernel command line, and initrd, but not the contents of the rootfs partition.
- The rootfs is not protected during the measured boot process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345):** The system fails to verify the integrity of the rootfs, which is critical for system security.
- The measured boot process fails to include rootfs verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can modify the rootfs, gaining full control over the system.
- This allows the attacker to introduce malicious software, change configurations, or otherwise compromise the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker can modify the squashfs root filesystem by:
    1. Repackaging the squashfs image with their modifications and replacing the original partition.
    2. Using the “mksquashfs” and “unsquashfs” binaries (and related libraries), present within the “003-storage-init” container, to modify the rootfs directly on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to modify the rootfs partition, either by directly replacing it with a modified version, or using tools to alter it.
- Physical access or pre-existing system access to modify the rootfs or the squashfs partition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The default filesystem used by EVE OS is squashfs, which is harder to modify directly than an ext4 file system, but the provided tools and approach will allow for modification.
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 9.0.0 when the config partition measurement was moved to PCR14 without being included in the measured boot process.
- The issue was partially fixed in later commits by adding the config partition measurement to PCR13.
