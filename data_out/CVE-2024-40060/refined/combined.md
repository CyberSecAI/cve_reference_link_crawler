|  | [Description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | go-chart v2.1.1 was discovered to contain an infinite loop via the drawCanvas() function. |
|  | When using the stacked bar chart component of go chart, if the name of the stacked bar is too long, it will cause the program to fail to run properly, which is reflected in the infinite loop when executing drawCanvas() during rendering. |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Product Code Base] |
|  | go-chart - <=2.1.1 |
