{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An infinite loop occurs within the `drawCanvas()` function when rendering a stacked bar chart with a bar name that is excessively long.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of long bar names within the `drawCanvas()` function when rendering a stacked bar chart. This lack of proper validation or size limits leads to an infinite loop during the rendering process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The program will enter an infinite loop when attempting to render a stacked bar chart with a very long bar name. This causes the program to become unresponsive and fail to complete its intended function. The system may also suffer from resource exhaustion if this infinite loop is not handled properly.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a stacked bar chart component with an excessively long name for one or more of the stacked bars.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to control the parameters of the chart creation, particularly the names of the stacked bars. No specific position or access is required, but the attacker must have the ability to specify the chart data."
