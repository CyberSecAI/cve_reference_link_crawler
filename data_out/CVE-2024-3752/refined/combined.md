## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Crelly Slider <= 1.4.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Crelly Slider"
2. Add a slider
3. In the "callback" field add the payload `</textarea><script>alert(1)</script>`
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Navigate away and then back and "edit" the slider to see the XSS
