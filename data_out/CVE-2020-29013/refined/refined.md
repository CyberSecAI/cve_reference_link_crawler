- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in FortiSandbox's sniffer interface regarding maximum file size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can halt the sniffer, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Network requests to the sniffer interface with crafted file size parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires an authenticated attacker.
