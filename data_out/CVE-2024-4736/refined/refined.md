**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Potential impacts include session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the `name/per` argument in the URL when accessing the `/admin/tax` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and somehow get a user to access it.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated since it is an XSS vulnerability.
