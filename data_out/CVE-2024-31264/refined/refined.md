- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Post Views Counter plugin, versions 1.4.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users (such as administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would depend on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, could perform actions within the vulnerable plugin without the administrator's knowledge or consent. This is typically achieved through social engineering or by embedding malicious code on a website visited by the targeted user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in privileged user to trigger a crafted malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress application.
