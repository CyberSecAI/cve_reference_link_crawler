{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the deserialization of untrusted data from the `recently_viewed_products` cookie, which allows an attacker to inject a PHP object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "PHP Object Injection due to insecure deserialization of user-controlled data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject a PHP object. If a suitable POP chain exists in other plugins or the theme, this can lead to arbitrary file deletion, sensitive data retrieval, or remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted `recently_viewed_products` cookie sent to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any authentication and can send the malicious cookie remotely."
