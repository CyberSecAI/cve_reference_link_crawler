# Form validation can be skipped

Low

[bwaidelich](/bwaidelich)
published
GHSA-m5vx-8chx-qvmm
Jun 21, 2021

## Package

composer

neos/form
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 1.2.0

## Patched versions

4.3.3, 5.0.9, 5.1.3

## Description

### Impact

By crafting a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be submitted without invoking any validators.

We consider the severity *low* because it is not possible to *change* any form values since the form state is secured with an HMAC that is still verified.

That means that this issue can only be exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values have been sent.

### Patches

[69de421](https://github.com/neos/form/commit/69de4219b1f58157e2be6b05811463875d75c246)

### Workarounds

Form Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data.

Alternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher.

### References
