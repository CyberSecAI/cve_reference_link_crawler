This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the "rpcecho" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv\_echo\_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-03 07:34:37 UTC  ``` Calls to the rpcecho server on the AD DC can request that the server block for a user-defined amount of time, denying service. One RPC function provided by "rpcecho" can block, essentially indefinitely, and because the "rpcecho" service is provided from the main RPC task, which has only one worker, this denies essentially all service on the AD DC.  <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15474>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c2)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-11 10:43:33 UTC  ``` This CVE is now Public: <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-42669.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c3)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-11 10:46:02 UTC  ``` Created samba tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2243229](show_bug.cgi?id=2243229 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-42669 samba: \"rpcecho\" development server allows denial of service via sleep() call on AD DC [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-10-31 10:05:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:6209 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6209](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A6209)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-07 10:08:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:6744 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6744](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A6744)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-21 11:17:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:7371 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7371](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7371)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-21 11:42:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:7408 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7408](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7408)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-22 17:27:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:7464 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7464](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7464)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2241884#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-11-22 17:29:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:7467 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7467](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A7467)   ``` |  |
