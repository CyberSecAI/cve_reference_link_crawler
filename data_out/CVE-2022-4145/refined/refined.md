The provided content relates to CVE-2022-4145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a content spoofing flaw in the OpenShift OAuth endpoint. Specifically, the `error_description` query parameter in the OAuth endpoint can be manipulated to inject arbitrary text into the error message displayed in the OpenShift response JSON.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Content spoofing: The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input provided via the `error_description` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the error message displayed to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: An attacker can inject text into the error message that can mislead users into believing they are interacting with a legitimate service, thereby enabling phishing attacks. For instance, the attacker could inject a link to a malicious website disguised as a legitimate link or display a phone number that redirects to an attacker.
- Obfuscation: The injected content can be used to obfuscate malicious activity or hide the true nature of the error message from the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating the `error_description` parameter in the URL of the OpenShift OAuth endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated, as the vulnerability lies in manipulating a query parameter in the OAuth endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The injected content is directly displayed in the OpenShift response JSON.
- The provided example URL demonstrates how an attacker injects text such as  "An error occurred, to correct please visit http://dr.evil.com or call the number 081337" into the error message.
