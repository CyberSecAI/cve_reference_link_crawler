I get an error with this slug ;slug/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=download-plugins-dashboard
⚪ Clicking the settings link on the plugin page leads to a permission error page.
slug/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download-plugins-dashboard-> This slug is functioning effectively for me.If this is indeed an error, kindly update the link in a future release. Thank you! 🙂
