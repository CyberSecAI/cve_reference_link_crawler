The Bulk Edit Post Titles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the bulkUpdatePostTitles function in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to modify the titles of arbitrary posts.
