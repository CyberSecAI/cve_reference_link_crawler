- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Crafted data within an FBX file triggers a read past the end of an allocated buffer during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious FBX file or visits a malicious page containing such file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious FBX file to the victim. User interaction is required to open the file.
