# Heap out-of-bounds write in uams\_dhx\_pam.c

High

[rdmark](/rdmark)
published
GHSA-mxx4-9fhm-r3w5
Jun 29, 2024

## Package

netatalk

## Affected versions

< 3.2.1

## Patched versions

3.2.1

## Description

### Impact

The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a lack of validation for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled.

### Patches

Users should upgrade their systems to Netatalk 3.2.1 as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

Disable the `uams_dhx.so` authentication module in your afp.conf file.

### References

<https://netatalk.io/support>

### Original bug report

The body of the issue ticket filed by [@flysoar](https://github.com/flysoar) follows below.

**Describe the bug**

The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a lack of validation for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled.

The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN\_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams\_dhx\_pam.c.

`uams_dhx_pam.c`

`if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) {`

**To Reproduce**

Compile the Netatalk with ASAN enabled.

The afp.conf file content is thefolloing.

```
[ Global ]
uam list = uams_guest.so,uams_dhx2.so,uams_pam.so
save password = no
set password = yes
unix charset = UTF8
use sendfile = yes
zeroconf = no
guest account = nobody
server quantum = 33000

```

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment**

* Server OS: Ubuntu2204
* Netatalk 3.2.0

**Logs**

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
