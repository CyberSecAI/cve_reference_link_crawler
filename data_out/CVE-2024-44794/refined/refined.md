Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `OnedriveRedirect.php` script. The script directly echoes the value of the `error_description` parameter from the GET request without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-controlled input from the `error_description` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- This could lead to various impacts such as:
    - **Session hijacking**: Stealing user cookies/tokens.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the webpage
    - **Redirecting** users to malicious sites.
    - **Information theft:**  Accessing sensitive information within the browser context.
    - **Malware delivery:** Redirecting users to download malware.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a crafted URL, specifically the `error_description` parameter in a GET request to `auth/OnedriveRedirect.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `error_description` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL (e.g., via phishing or a malicious link).
- The attacker does not need prior access to the web server itself.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `auth/OnedriveRedirect.php`
```php
if(isset($_GET['code'])){
    // ...
}else if(isset($_GET['error']) && isset($_GET['error_description'])){
    echo $_GET['error_description']; // Sink in Line 39
}
```
- The attacker provides a malicious script in the `error_description` parameter, e.g.:
`GET /auth/OnedriveRedirect.php?error=&error_description=<script>alert('xss')</script>`

This is a classic reflected XSS vulnerability caused by lack of sanitization of the `$_GET['error_description']` input before it is displayed to the user, potentially allowing malicious code execution on the victim's browser.
