- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of frames with VLAN tag information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from the way Cisco IOS XE Software handles frames with VLAN tag information. This improper handling can be exploited by sending crafted frames. The specific weakness is related to integer overflow (CWE-190)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the control plane of an affected device, rendering it unresponsive. The device becomes inaccessible via console or CLI, does not respond to ping, SNMP or other control plane protocol requests. Data plane traffic is not affected. A device reload is required to restore control plane services.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send crafted frames to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker with adjacent network access is required.
