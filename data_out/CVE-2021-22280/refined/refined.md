- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper DLL loading algorithms in B&R Automation Studio.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking vulnerability. The application loads DLLs in an insecure manner, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded instead of the intended one.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of another user's account, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data integrity and confidentiality compromise, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required, the attacker must place a malicious DLL file on the target system. When B&R Automation Studio is executed, it loads the malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with valid credentials and access to the system.
