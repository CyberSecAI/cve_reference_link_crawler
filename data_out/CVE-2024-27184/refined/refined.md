- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate validation of URLs when determining if a redirect URL is internal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Open redirect vulnerability due to insufficient validation of URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary external website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL that bypasses the internal URL validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft or manipulate URLs that the Joomla application processes. This typically involves user interaction (clicking a crafted link) or injection into a field where URLs are processed by the application.
