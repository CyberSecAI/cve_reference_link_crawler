- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `alluxio.util.CommonUtils.getUnixGroups(java.lang.String)` method in Alluxio does not properly sanitize user-provided input, leading to command injection. Specifically, the method passes a username string to a shell command (`id -gn` and `id -Gn`) without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization in `alluxio.util.CommonUtils.getUnixGroups`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system hosting the Alluxio instance with the privileges of the user running the Alluxio process.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious commands by providing a crafted username string containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `|`, `;`, `&`) as an argument to the `alluxio.util.CommonUtils.getUnixGroups` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to control the username string passed to the vulnerable `getUnixGroups` method. This implies the attacker may need to have some level of access/control over the Alluxio environment or the user input feeding into the function call.
