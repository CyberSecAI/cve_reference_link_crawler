For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-multiple-kTQkGU3>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco DNA Center Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2023-20182: Cisco DNA Center Software API Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands in a restricted container as the *root* user.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in API request parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with *root* privileges.  **Note:**    + In Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.4 and earlier, low privileges are sufficient for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.   + In Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.5 and later, only users with NETWORK-ADMIN-ROLE or SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE can exploit this vulnerability. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd58359](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd58359)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20182Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.4CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  **CVE-2023-20183: Cisco DNA Center Software API User Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to enumerate limited user information.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization of API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate limited information of users configured on the device. This information does not include passwords or password hashes.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd59863](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd59863)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20183Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2023-20184: Cisco DNA Center Software API Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to read information from a restricted container.  This vulnerability is due to improper authorization of API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read information from a restricted container that would normally be accessible only to high-privileged users.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd58450](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd58450)CVE ID: CVE-2023-20184Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 4.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
