- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in API request parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with *root* privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted API request to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated, remote attacker
    - In Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.4 and earlier, low privileges are sufficient.
    - In Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.5 and later, only users with NETWORK-ADMIN-ROLE or SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE can exploit this vulnerability.
