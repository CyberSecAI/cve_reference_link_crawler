# MSI package installation permits local users to change Agent configuration

High

[g-bougard](/g-bougard)
published
GHSA-hx3x-mmqg-h3jp
Apr 25, 2024

## Package

GLPI-Agent-1.\*.msi
(windows)

## Affected versions

< 1.7.2

## Patched versions

1.7.2

## Description

### Impact

This only affects GLPI-Agent installed on windows via MSI packaging.

A local user can use this feature to:

* denial of agent service by replacing GLPI server url with a wrong url or disabling the service
* a local user can gain privilege escalation configuring a private server providing a malicious deploy task as a payload

### Patches

Upgrade to GLPI-Agent 1.7.2

### Workarounds

Disable MSI support by setting per-machine `DisableMSI` policy to `2`: see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/disablemsi>

Locally you can add/edit `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\DisableMSI` as a DWORD value and set it to `2`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
