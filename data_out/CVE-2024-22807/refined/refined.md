{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect access control",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Allows attackers to erase a critical sector of the flash memory.",
    "Lack of proper access control allows unauthorized memory modification.",
     "Insecure communication protocol allows crafted commands to cause denial of service"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The machine loses network connectivity and suffers from firmware corruption, leading to denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Executing commands to erase a vital flash memory sector.",
    "Remote network access"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote network access to the vulnerable CNC router."
}
