- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization in the `boxAdd` function of the `vagrant.js` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful attack can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `boxAdd` function by injecting malicious commands via the input string argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable function.
