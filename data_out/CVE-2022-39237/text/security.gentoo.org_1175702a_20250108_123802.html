# Apptainer: Lack of Digital Signature Hash Verification — GLSA **202210-19**

A vulnerability has been found in Apptainer which could result in the usage of an unexpected of a container.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-containers/apptainer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.2** |

### Background

Apptainer is the container system for secure high-performance computing.

### Description

The Go module "sif" version 2.8.0 and older, which is a statically linked dependency of Apptainer, does not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures.

### Impact

An image whose verification relies on a cryptographically insecure hash algorithm could be replaced, resulting in users using an image other than the one that was expected.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apptainer users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-containers/apptainer-1.1.2"

```
