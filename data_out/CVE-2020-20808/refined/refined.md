{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `eindtijd` and `starttijd` parameters in `/do/search.php` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed by the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `eindtijd` and `starttijd` parameters in the `/do/search.php` URL. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and convince the victim to access it. This could be done through social engineering, phishing, or other means."
