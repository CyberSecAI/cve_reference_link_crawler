- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Type confusion occurs when the `fields` property of a `Lock` object is accessed after a call to `deletePages` which frees objects and resets the `fields` property to a different object. Later, when the `fields` property is accessed without type validation, a type confusion occurs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion due to lack of type validation when accessing the `fields` property of a `Lock` object after a `deletePages` call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Opening a malicious PDF document containing specially crafted JavaScript code.
  - Visiting a malicious site with the browser plugin extension enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious PDF or visiting a malicious site.
