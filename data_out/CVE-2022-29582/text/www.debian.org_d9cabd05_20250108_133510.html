Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-4197

    Eric Biederman reported that incorrect permission checks in the
    cgroup process migration implementation can allow a local attacker
    to escalate privileges.

CVE-2022-0168

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the CIFS client
    implementation which can allow a local attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    privileges to crash the system. The security impact is negligible as
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN inherently gives the ability to deny service.

CVE-2022-1016

    David Bouman discovered a flaw in the netfilter subsystem where the
    nft_do_chain function did not initialize register data that
    nf_tables expressions can read from and write to. A local attacker
    can take advantage of this to read sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1048

    Hu Jiahui discovered a race condition in the sound subsystem that
    can result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access a
    PCM sound device can take advantage of this flaw to crash the
    system or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1158

    Qiuhao Li, Gaoning Pan, and Yongkang Jia discovered a bug in the
    KVM implementation for x86 processors. A local user with access to
    /dev/kvm could cause the MMU emulator to update page table entry
    flags at the wrong address. They could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1195

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the 6pack and mkiss hamradio
    drivers, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1198

    Duoming Zhou discovered a race condition in the 6pack hamradio
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free. A local user could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-1199, CVE-2022-1204, CVE-2022-1205

    Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 hamradio
    protocol, which could lead to a use-after-free or null pointer
    dereference. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-1353

    The TCS Robot tool found an information leak in the PF_KEY
    subsystem. A local user can receive a netlink message when an
    IPsec daemon reegisters with the kernel, and this could include
    sensitive information.

CVE-2022-1516

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw in the implementation of the X.25
    set of standardized network protocols, which can result in denial
    of service.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-26490

    Buffer overflows in the STMicroelectronics ST21NFCA core driver can
    result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-27666

    "valis" reported a possible buffer overflow in the IPsec ESP
    transformation code. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-28356

    Beraphin discovered that the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 driver did
    not properly perform reference counting on some error paths. A
    local attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-28388

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the 8 devices USB2CAN
    interface driver.

CVE-2022-28389

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the Microchip CAN BUS
    Analyzer interface driver.

CVE-2022-28390

    A double free vulnerability was discovered in the EMS CPC-USB/ARM7
    CAN/USB interface driver.

CVE-2022-29582

    Jayden Rivers and David Bouman discovered a user-after-free
    vulnerability in the io_uring subystem due to a race condition in
    io_uring timeouts. A local unprivileged user can take advantage of
    this flaw for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.113-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
