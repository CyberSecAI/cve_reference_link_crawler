    io_uring: drop the old style inflight file tracking

    commit d5361233e9ab920e135819f73dd8466355f1fddd upstream.

    io_uring tracks requests that are referencing an io_uring descriptor to
    be able to cancel without worrying about loops in the references. Since
    we now assign the file at execution time, the easier approach is to drop
    a potentially problematic reference before we punt the request. This
    eliminates the need to special case these types of files beyond just
    marking them as such, and simplifies cancelation quite a bit.

    This also fixes a recent issue where an async punted tee operation would
    with the io_uring descriptor as the output file would crash when
    attempting to get a reference to the file from the io-wq worker. We
    could have worked around that, but this is the much cleaner fix.

    io_uring: defer file assignment

    commit 6bf9c47a398911e0ab920e362115153596c80432 upstream.

    If an application uses direct open or accept, it knows in advance what
    direct descriptor value it will get as it picks it itself. This allows
    combined requests such as:

    sqe = io_uring_get_sqe(ring);
    io_uring_prep_openat_direct(sqe, ..., file_slot);
    sqe->flags |= IOSQE_IO_LINK | IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS;

    sqe = io_uring_get_sqe(ring);
    io_uring_prep_read(sqe,file_slot, buf, buf_size, 0);
    sqe->flags |= IOSQE_FIXED_FILE;

    io_uring_submit(ring);

    where we prepare both a file open and read, and only get a completion
    event for the read when both have completed successfully.

    Currently links are fully prepared before the head is issued, but that
    fails if the dependent link needs a file assigned that isn't valid until
    the head has completed.

    Conversely, if the same chain is performed but the fixed file slot is
    already valid, then we would be unexpectedly returning data from the
    old file slot rather than the newly opened one. Make sure we're
    consistent here.

    Allow deferral of file setup, which makes this documented case work.

    static_call: Don't make __static_call_return0 static

    commit 8fd4ddda2f49a66bf5dd3d0c01966c4b1971308b upstream.

    System.map shows that vmlinux contains several instances of
    __static_call_return0():

            c0004fc0 t __static_call_return0
            c0011518 t __static_call_return0
            c00d8160 t __static_call_return0

    arch_static_call_transform() uses the middle one to check whether we are
    setting a call to __static_call_return0 or not:

            c0011520 <arch_static_call_transform>:
            c0011520:       3d 20 c0 01     lis     r9,-16383       <== r9 =  0xc001 << 16
            c0011524:       39 29 15 18     addi    r9,r9,5400      <== r9 += 0x1518
            c0011528:       7c 05 48 00     cmpw    r5,r9           <== r9 has value 0xc0011518 here

    So if static_call_update() is called with one of the other instances of
    __static_call_return0(), arch_static_call_transform() won't recognise it.

    In order to work properly, global single instance of __static_call_return0() is required.

    mm/sparsemem: fix 'mem_section' will never be NULL gcc 12 warning

    commit a431dbbc540532b7465eae4fc8b56a85a9fc7d17 upstream.

    The gcc 12 compiler reports a "'mem_section' will never be NULL" warning
    on the following code:

        static inline struct mem_section *__nr_to_section(unsigned long nr)
        {
        #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
            if (!mem_section)
                    return NULL;
        #endif
            if (!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)])
                    return NULL;
           :

    It happens with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME off.  The mem_section definition
    is

        #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
        extern struct mem_section **mem_section;
        #else
        extern struct mem_section mem_section[NR_SECTION_ROOTS][SECTIONS_PER_ROOT];
        #endif

    In the !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME case, mem_section is a static
    2-dimensional array and so the check "!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)]"
    doesn't make sense.

    Fix this warning by moving the "!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)]"
    check up inside the CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME block and adding an
    explicit NR_SECTION_ROOTS check to make sure that there is no
    out-of-bound array access.

    irqchip/gic, gic-v3: Prevent GSI to SGI translations

    commit 544808f7e21cb9ccdb8f3aa7de594c05b1419061 upstream.

    At the moment the GIC IRQ domain translation routine happily converts
    ACPI table GSI numbers below 16 to GIC SGIs (Software Generated
    Interrupts aka IPIs). On the Devicetree side we explicitly forbid this
    translation, actually the function will never return HWIRQs below 16 when
    using a DT based domain translation.

    We expect SGIs to be handled in the first part of the function, and any
    further occurrence should be treated as a firmware bug, so add a check
    and print to report this explicitly and avoid lengthy debug sessions.

    irqchip/gic-v4: Wait for GICR_VPENDBASER.Dirty to clear before descheduling

    commit af27e41612ec7e5b4783f589b753a7c31a37aac8 upstream.

    The way KVM drives GICv4.{0,1} is as follows:
    - vcpu_load() makes the VPE resident, instructing the RD to start
      scanning for interrupts
    - just before entering the guest, we check that the RD has finished
      scanning and that we can start running the vcpu
    - on preemption, we deschedule the VPE by making it invalid on
      the RD

    However, we are preemptible between the first two steps. If it so
    happens *and* that the RD was still scanning, we nonetheless write
    to the GICR_VPENDBASER register while Dirty is set, and bad things
    happen (we're in UNPRED land).

    This affects both the 4.0 and 4.1 implementations.

    Make sure Dirty is cleared before performing the deschedule,
    meaning that its_clear_vpend_valid() becomes a sort of full VPE
    residency barrier.

    x86/extable: Prefer local labels in .set directives

    commit 334865b2915c33080624e0d06f1c3e917036472c upstream.

    Bernardo reported an error that Nathan bisected down to
    (x86_64) defconfig+LTO_CLANG_FULL+X86_PMEM_LEGACY.

        LTO     vmlinux.o
      ld.lld: error: <instantiation>:1:13: redefinition of 'found'
      .set found, 0
                  ^

      <inline asm>:29:1: while in macro instantiation
      extable_type_reg reg=%eax, type=(17 | ((0) << 16))
      ^

    This appears to be another LTO specific issue similar to what was folded
    into commit 4b5305decc84 ("x86/extable: Extend extable functionality"),
    where the `.set found, 0` in DEFINE_EXTABLE_TYPE_REG in
    arch/x86/include/asm/asm.h conflicts with the symbol for the static
    function `found` in arch/x86/kernel/pmem.c.

    Assembler .set directive declare symbols with global visibility, so the
    assembler may not rename such symbols in the event of a conflict. LTO
    could rename static functions if there was a conflict in C sources, but
    it cannot see into symbols defined in inline asm.

    The symbols are also retained in the symbol table, regardless of LTO.

    Give the symbols .L prefixes making them locally visible, so that they
    may be renamed for LTO to avoid conflicts, and to drop them from the
    symbol table regardless of LTO.

    x86,static_call: Fix __static_call_return0 for i386

    commit 1cd5f059d956e6f614ba6666ecdbcf95db05d5f5 upstream.

    Paolo reported that the instruction sequence that is used to replace:

        call __static_call_return0

    namely:

        66 66 48 31 c0      data16 data16 xor %rax,%rax

    decodes to something else on i386, namely:

        66 66 48            data16 dec %ax
        31 c0               xor    %eax,%eax

    Which is a nonsensical sequence that happens to have the same outcome.
    *However* an important distinction is that it consists of 2
    instructions which is a problem when the thing needs to be overwriten
    with a regular call instruction again.

    As such, replace the instruction with something that decodes the same
    on both i386 and x86_64.

    sched/core: Fix forceidle balancing

    commit 5b6547ed97f4f5dfc23f8e3970af6d11d7b7ed7e upstream.

    Steve reported that ChromeOS encounters the forceidle balancer being
    ran from rt_mutex_setprio()'s balance_callback() invocation and
    explodes.

    Now, the forceidle balancer gets queued every time the idle task gets
    selected, set_next_task(), which is strictly too often.
    rt_mutex_setprio() also uses set_next_task() in the 'change' pattern:

            queued = task_on_rq_queued(p); /* p->on_rq == TASK_ON_RQ_QUEUED */
            running = task_current(rq, p); /* rq->curr == p */

            if (queued)
                    dequeue_task(...);
            if (running)
                    put_prev_task(...);

            /* change task properties */

            if (queued)
                    enqueue_task(...);
            if (running)
                    set_next_task(...);

    However, rt_mutex_setprio() will explicitly not run this pattern on
    the idle task (since priority boosting the idle task is quite insane).
    Most other 'change' pattern users are pidhash based and would also not
    apply to idle.

    Also, the change pattern doesn't contain a __balance_callback()
    invocation and hence we could have an out-of-band balance-callback,
    which *should* trigger the WARN in rq_pin_lock() (which guards against
    this exact anti-pattern).

    So while none of that explains how this happens, it does indicate that
    having it in set_next_task() might not be the most robust option.

    Instead, explicitly queue the forceidle balancer from pick_next_task()
    when it does indeed result in forceidle selection. Having it here,
    ensures it can only be triggered under the __schedule() rq->lock
    instance, and hence must be ran from that context.

    This also happens to clean up the code a little, so win-win.

    objtool: Fix SLS validation for kcov tail-call replacement

    commit 7a53f408902d913cd541b4f8ad7dbcd4961f5b82 upstream.

    Since not all compilers have a function attribute to disable KCOV
    instrumentation, objtool can rewrite KCOV instrumentation in noinstr
    functions as per commit:

      f56dae88a81f ("objtool: Handle __sanitize_cov*() tail calls")

    However, this has subtle interaction with the SLS validation from
    commit:

      1cc1e4c8aab4 ("objtool: Add straight-line-speculation validation")

    In that when a tail-call instrucion is replaced with a RET an
    additional INT3 instruction is also written, but is not represented in
    the decoded instruction stream.

    This then leads to false positive missing INT3 objtool warnings in
    noinstr code.

    Instead of adding additional struct instruction objects, mark the RET
    instruction with retpoline_safe to suppress the warning (since we know
    there really is an INT3).

    x86/bug: Prevent shadowing in __WARN_FLAGS

    commit 9ce02f0fc68326dd1f87a0a3a4c6ae7fdd39e6f6 upstream.

    The macro __WARN_FLAGS() uses a local variable named "f". This being a
    common name, there is a risk of shadowing other variables.

    For example, GCC would yield:

    This patch renames the variable from f to __flags (with two underscore

    Revert "powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly"

    commit 1ff5c8e8c835e8a81c0868e3050c76563dd56a2c upstream.

    This reverts commit 602946ec2f90d5bd965857753880db29d2d9a1e9.

    If CONFIG_HIGHMEM is enabled, no highmem will be added with max_mapnr
    set to max_low_pfn, see mem_init():

      for (pfn = highmem_mapnr; pfn < max_mapnr; ++pfn) {
            ...
            free_highmem_page();
      }

    Now that virt_addr_valid() has been fixed in the previous commit, we can
    revert the change to max_mapnr.

    powerpc: Fix virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit Book3E & 32-bit

    commit ffa0b64e3be58519ae472ea29a1a1ad681e32f48 upstream.

    mpe: On 64-bit Book3E vmalloc space starts at 0x8000000000000000.

    Because of the way __pa() works we have:
      __pa(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
      virt_to_pfn(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
      virt_addr_valid(0x8000000000000000) == true

    Which is wrong, virt_addr_valid() should be false for vmalloc space.
    In fact all vmalloc addresses that alias with a valid PFN will return
    true from virt_addr_valid(). That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy
    as described below by Kefeng Wang:

      When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:

        usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!
        kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99
        ...
        usercopy_abort+0x64/0xa0 (unreliable)
        __check_heap_object+0x168/0x190
        __check_object_size+0x1a0/0x200
        dev_ethtool+0x2494/0x2b20
        dev_ioctl+0x5d0/0x770
        sock_do_ioctl+0xf0/0x1d0
        sock_ioctl+0x3ec/0x5a0
        __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160
        system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0
        system_call_common+0xf8/0x200

      The code shows below,

        data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));
        copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))

      The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true
      on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.

      As commit 4dd7554a6456 ("powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va
      and __pa addresses") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in
      the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make
      sure the virt is below high_memory.

      Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start
      of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is
      suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit
      602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly") too.

    On 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in
    commit 602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly"), but that
    commit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.

    We can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current
    behaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().

    For 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of
    virt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they
    are harmless.

    KVM: avoid NULL pointer dereference in kvm_dirty_ring_push

    commit 5593473a1e6c743764b08e3b6071cb43b5cfa6c4 upstream.

    kvm_vcpu_release() will call kvm_dirty_ring_free(), freeing
    ring->dirty_gfns and setting it to NULL.  Afterwards, it calls
    kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy().

    However, if closing the file descriptor races with KVM_RUN in such away
    that vcpu->arch.st.preempted == 0, the following call stack leads to a
    NULL pointer dereference in kvm_dirty_run_push():

     mark_page_dirty_in_slot+0x192/0x270 arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:3171
     kvm_steal_time_set_preempted arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:4600 [inline]

     kvm_vcpu_destroy arch/x86/kvm/../../../virt/kvm/kvm_main.c:441 [inline]

    The fix is to release the dirty page ring after kvm_arch_vcpu_destroy
    has run.

    Just like its done for ldopts and for both in tools/perf/Makefile.config.

    Using `` to initialize PERL_EMBED_CCOPTS somehow precludes using:

      $(filter-out SOMETHING_TO_FILTER,$(PERL_EMBED_CCOPTS))

    And we need to do it to allow for building with versions of clang where
    some gcc options selected by distros are not available.

    Yes, I think that is probably the best solution. As far as I can tell,
    at least in this file and context, the warning appears harmless, as the
    "create a GNU C statement expression from two different macros" is very
    much intentional, based on the presence of PERL_USE_GCC_BRACE_GROUPS.
    The warning is fixed in upstream Perl by just avoiding creating GNU C
    statement expressions using STMT_START and STMT_END:

      https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18780
      https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18984

    If I am reading the source code correctly, an alternative to disabling
    the warning would be specifying -DPERL_GCC_BRACE_GROUPS_FORBIDDEN but it
    seems like that might end up impacting more than just this site,

    perf python: Fix probing for some clang command line options

    commit dd6e1fe91cdd52774ca642d1da75b58a86356b56 upstream.

    The clang compiler complains about some options even without a source
    file being available, while others require one, so use the simple
    tools/build/feature/test-hello.c file.

    Then check for the "is not supported" string in its output, in addition
    to the "unknown argument" already being looked for.

    This was noticed when building with clang-13 where -ffat-lto-objects
    isn't supported and since we were looking just for "unknown argument"
    and not providing a source code to clang, was mistakenly assumed as
    being available and not being filtered to set of command line options
    provided to clang, leading to a build failure.

    bpf: Treat bpf_sk_lookup remote_port as a 2-byte field

    commit 058ec4a7d9cf77238c73ad9f1e1a3ed9a29afcab upstream.

    In commit 9a69e2b385f4 ("bpf: Make remote_port field in struct
    bpf_sk_lookup 16-bit wide") the remote_port field has been split up and
    re-declared from u32 to be16.

    However, the accompanying changes to the context access converter have not
    been well thought through when it comes big-endian platforms.

    Today 2-byte wide loads from offsetof(struct bpf_sk_lookup, remote_port)
    are handled as narrow loads from a 4-byte wide field.

    This by itself is not enough to create a problem, but when we combine

     1. 32-bit wide access to ->remote_port backed by a 16-wide wide load, with
     2. inherent difference between litte- and big-endian in how narrow loads
        need have to be handled (see bpf_ctx_narrow_access_offset),

    we get inconsistent results for a 2-byte loads from &ctx->remote_port on LE
    and BE architectures. This in turn makes BPF C code for the common case of
    2-byte load from ctx->remote_port not portable.

    To rectify it, inform the context access converter that remote_port is
    2-byte wide field, and only 1-byte loads need to be treated as narrow
    loads.

    At the same time, we special-case the 4-byte load from &ctx->remote_port to
    continue handling it the same way as do today, in order to keep the
    existing BPF programs working.

    selftests/bpf: Fix u8 narrow load checks for bpf_sk_lookup remote_port

    commit 3c69611b8926f8e74fcf76bd97ae0e5dafbeb26a upstream.

    In commit 9a69e2b385f4 ("bpf: Make remote_port field in struct
    bpf_sk_lookup 16-bit wide") ->remote_port field changed from __u32 to
    __be16.

    However, narrow load tests which exercise 1-byte sized loads from
    offsetof(struct bpf_sk_lookup, remote_port) were not adopted to reflect the
    change.

    As a result, on little-endian we continue testing loads from addresses:

     - (__u8 *)&ctx->remote_port + 3
     - (__u8 *)&ctx->remote_port + 4

    which map to the zero padding following the remote_port field, and don't
    break the tests because there is no observable change.

    While on big-endian, we observe breakage because tests expect to see zeros
    for values loaded from:

     - (__u8 *)&ctx->remote_port - 1
     - (__u8 *)&ctx->remote_port - 2

    Above addresses map to ->remote_ip6 field, which precedes ->remote_port,
    and are populated during the bpf_sk_lookup IPv6 tests.

    Unsurprisingly, on s390x we observe:

      #136/38 sk_lookup/narrow access to ctx v4:OK
      #136/39 sk_lookup/narrow access to ctx v6:FAIL

    Fix it by removing the checks for 1-byte loads from offsets outside of the
    ->remote_port field.

    bpf: Make remote_port field in struct bpf_sk_lookup 16-bit wide

    commit 9a69e2b385f443f244a7e8b8bcafe5ccfb0866b4 upstream.

    remote_port is another case of a BPF context field documented as a 32-bit
    value in network byte order for which the BPF context access converter
    generates a load of a zero-padded 16-bit integer in network byte order.

    First such case was dst_port in bpf_sock which got addressed in commit
    4421a582718a ("bpf: Make dst_port field in struct bpf_sock 16-bit wide").

    Loading 4-bytes from the remote_port offset and converting the value with
    bpf_ntohl() leads to surprising results, as the expected value is shifted
    by 16 bits.

    Reduce the confusion by splitting the field in two - a 16-bit field holding
    a big-endian integer, and a 16-bit zero-padding anonymous field that
    follows it.

    Revert "ACPI: processor: idle: Only flush cache on entering C3"

    commit dfbba2518aac4204203b0697a894d3b2f80134d3 upstream.

    Revert commit 87ebbb8c612b ("ACPI: processor: idle: Only flush cache
    on entering C3") that broke the assumptions of the acpi_idle_play_dead()
    callers.

    Namely, the CPU cache must always be flushed in acpi_idle_play_dead(),
    regardless of the target C-state that is going to be requested, because
    this is likely to be part of a CPU offline procedure or preparation for
    entering a system-wide sleep state and the lack of synchronization
    between the CPU cache and RAM may lead to problems going forward, for
    example when the CPU is brought back online.

    In particular, it breaks resume from suspend-to-RAM on Lenovo ThinkPad
    C13 which fails occasionally until the problematic commit is reverted.

    SUNRPC: Ensure we flush any closed sockets before xs_xprt_free()

    commit f00432063db1a0db484e85193eccc6845435b80e upstream.

    We must ensure that all sockets are closed before we call xprt_free()
    and release the reference to the net namespace. The problem is that
    calling fput() will defer closing the socket until delayed_fput() gets
    called.
    Let's fix the situation by allowing rpciod and the transport teardown
    code (which runs on the system wq) to call __fput_sync(), and directly
    close the socket.

    drm/amd/display: Fix by adding FPU protection for dcn30_internal_validate_bw

    commit ca1198849ab0e7af5efb392ef6baf1138f6fc086 upstream.

    [Why]
    Below general protection fault observed when WebGL Aquarium is run for
    longer duration. If drm debug logs are enabled and set to 0x1f then the
    issue is observed within 10 minutes of run.

    Adding FPU protection avoids context switch and probable loss of vba context
    as there is potential contention while drm debug logs are enabled.

    commit d14eb80e27795b7b20060f7b151cdfe39722a813 upstream.

    If the optional regulator lookup fails, reset the pointer to NULL.
    Other functions such as mipi_dbi_poweron_reset_conditional() only do
    a NULL pointer check and will otherwise dereference the error pointer.

    amd/display: set backlight only if required

    commit 4052287a75eb3fc0f487fcc5f768a38bede455c8 upstream.

    [Why]
    comparing pwm bl values (coverted) with user brightness(converted)
    levels in commit_tail leads to continuous setting of backlight via dmub
    as they don't to match.
    This leads overdrive in queuing of commands to DMCU that sometimes lead
    to depending on load on DMCU fw:

    "[drm:dc_dmub_srv_wait_idle] *ERROR* Error waiting for DMUB idle: status=3"

    [How]
    Store last successfully set backlight value and compare with it instead
    of pwm reads which is not what we should compare with.

    fbdev: Fix unregistering of framebuffers without device

    commit 0f525289ff0ddeb380813bd81e0f9bdaaa1c9078 upstream.

    OF framebuffers do not have an underlying device in the Linux
    device hierarchy. Do a regular unregister call instead of hot
    unplugging such a non-existing device. Fixes a NULL dereference.
    An example error message on ppc64le is shown below.

    have an underlying platform device, which can be hot-unplugged
    before loading the native graphics driver. OF framebuffers do not
    (yet) have that device. Fix the code by unregistering the framebuffer
    as before without a hot unplug.

    commit 0df6664531a12cdd8fc873f0cac0dcb40243d3e9 upstream.

    It turns out that our polling of RWP is totally wrong when checking
    for it in the redistributors, as we test the *distributor* bit index,
    whereas it is a different bit number in the RDs... Oopsie boo.

    This is embarassing. Not only because it is wrong, but also because
    it took *8 years* to notice the blunder...

    Just fix the damn thing.

    perf/core: Inherit event_caps

    commit e3265a4386428d3d157d9565bb520aabff8b4bf0 upstream.

    It was reported that some perf event setup can make fork failed on
    ARM64.  It was the case of a group of mixed hw and sw events and it
    failed in perf_event_init_task() due to armpmu_event_init().

    The ARM PMU code checks if all the events in a group belong to the
    same PMU except for software events.  But it didn't set the event_caps
    of inherited events and no longer identify them as software events.
    Therefore the test failed in a child process.

    A simple reproducer is:

      $ perf stat -e '{cycles,cs,instructions}' perf bench sched messaging
      # Running 'sched/messaging' benchmark:
      perf: fork(): Invalid argument

    The perf stat was fine but the perf bench failed in fork().  Let's
    inherit the event caps from the parent.

    perf: qcom_l2_pmu: fix an incorrect NULL check on list iterator

    commit 2012a9e279013933885983cbe0a5fe828052563b upstream.

    The bug is here:
            return cluster;

    The list iterator value 'cluster' will *always* be set and non-NULL
    by list_for_each_entry(), so it is incorrect to assume that the
    iterator value will be NULL if the list is empty or no element
    is found.

    To fix the bug, return 'cluster' when found, otherwise return NULL.

    ata: sata_dwc_460ex: Fix crash due to OOB write

    the driver uses libata's "tag" values from in various arrays.
    Since the mentioned patch bumped the ATA_TAG_INTERNAL to 32,
    the value of the SATA_DWC_QCMD_MAX needs to account for that.

    Otherwise ATA_TAG_INTERNAL usage cause similar crashes like
    this as reported by Tice Rex on the OpenWrt Forum and
    reproduced (with symbols) here:

    This is because sata_dwc_dma_xfer_complete() NULLs the
    dma_pending's next neighbour "chan" (a *dma_chan struct) in
    this '32' case right here (line ~735):
    > hsdevp->dma_pending[tag] = SATA_DWC_DMA_PENDING_NONE;

    Then the next time, a dma gets issued; dma_dwc_xfer_setup() passes
    the NULL'd hsdevp->chan to the dmaengine_slave_config() which then
    causes the crash.

    With this patch, SATA_DWC_QCMD_MAX is now set to ATA_MAX_QUEUE + 1.
    This avoids the OOB. But please note, there was a worthwhile discussion
    on what ATA_TAG_INTERNAL and ATA_MAX_QUEUE is. And why there should not
    be a "fake" 33 command-long queue size.

    Ideally, the dw driver should account for the ATA_TAG_INTERNAL.
    In Damien Le Moal's words: "... having looked at the driver, it
    is a bigger change than just faking a 33rd "tag" that is in fact
    not a command tag at all."

    perf/x86/intel: Don't extend the pseudo-encoding to GP counters

    commit 4a263bf331c512849062805ef1b4ac40301a9829 upstream.

    The INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST event (0x0100) doesn't count on SPR.
    perf stat -e cpu/event=0xc0,umask=0x0/,cpu/event=0x0,umask=0x1/ -C0

     Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':

               607,246      cpu/event=0xc0,umask=0x0/
                     0      cpu/event=0x0,umask=0x1/

    The encoding for INST_RETIRED.PREC_DIST is pseudo-encoding, which
    doesn't work on the generic counters. However, current perf extends its
    mask to the generic counters.

    The pseudo event-code for a fixed counter must be 0x00. Check and avoid
    extending the mask for the fixed counter event which using the
    pseudo-encoding, e.g., ref-cycles and PREC_DIST event.

    With the patch,
    perf stat -e cpu/event=0xc0,umask=0x0/,cpu/event=0x0,umask=0x1/ -C0

     Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':

    x86/mm/tlb: Revert retpoline avoidance approach

    commit d39268ad24c0fd0665d0c5cf55a7c1a0ebf94766 upstream.

    0day reported a regression on a microbenchmark which is intended to
    stress the TLB flushing path:

            https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220317090415.GE735@xsang-OptiPlex-9020/

    It pointed at a commit from Nadav which intended to remove retpoline
    overhead in the TLB flushing path by taking the 'cond'-ition in
    on_each_cpu_cond_mask(), pre-calculating it, and incorporating it into
    'cpumask'.  That allowed the code to use a bunch of earlier direct
    calls instead of later indirect calls that need a retpoline.

    But, in practice, threads can go idle (and into lazy TLB mode where
    they don't need to flush their TLB) between the early and late calls.
    It works in this direction and not in the other because TLB-flushing
    threads tend to hold mmap_lock for write.  Contention on that lock
    causes threads to _go_ idle right in this early/late window.

    There was not any performance data in the original commit specific
    to the retpoline overhead.  I did a few tests on a system with
    retpolines:

            https://lore.kernel.org/all/dd8be93c-ded6-b962-50d4-96b1c3afb2b7@intel.com/

    which showed a possible small win.  But, that small win pales in
    comparison with the bigger loss induced on non-retpoline systems.

    Revert the patch that removed the retpolines.  This was not a
    clean revert, but it was self-contained enough not to be too painful.

    gpio: Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization

    commit 5467801f1fcbdc46bc7298a84dbf3ca1ff2a7320 upstream.

    GPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely
    initialized and this leads to race conditions.

    One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which
    was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before
    it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in
    Kernel NULL pointer dereference.

    Following are the logs for reference :-

    kernel: Call Trace:
    kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70
    kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0

    kernel:  really_probe+0xf2/0x460
    kernel: RIP: 0010:gpiochip_to_irq+0x47/0xc0

    To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before
    they are completely initialized.

    drbd: fix an invalid memory access caused by incorrect use of list iterator

    commit ae4d37b5df749926891583d42a6801b5da11e3c1 upstream.

    The bug is here:
            idr_remove(&connection->peer_devices, vnr);

    If the previous for_each_connection() don't exit early (no goto hit
    inside the loop), the iterator 'connection' after the loop will be a
    bogus pointer to an invalid structure object containing the HEAD
    (&resource->connections). As a result, the use of 'connection' above
    will lead to a invalid memory access (including a possible invalid free
    as idr_remove could call free_layer).

    The original intention should have been to remove all peer_devices,
    but the following lines have already done the work. So just remove
    this line and the unneeded label, to fix this bug.

    RDMA/hfi1: Fix use-after-free bug for mm struct

    commit 2bbac98d0930e8161b1957dc0ec99de39ade1b3c upstream.

    Under certain conditions, such as MPI_Abort, the hfi1 cleanup code may
    represent the last reference held on the task mm.
    hfi1_mmu_rb_unregister() then drops the last reference and the mm is freed
    before the final use in hfi1_release_user_pages().  A new task may
    allocate the mm structure while it is still being used, resulting in
    problems. One manifestation is corruption of the mmap_sem counter leading
    to a hang in down_write().  Another is corruption of an mm struct that is
    in use by another task.

    To fix a coverity complain, commit d5ac07dfbd2b
    ("qed: Initialize debug string array") removed "sw-platform"
    (one of the common global parameters) from the dump as this
    was used in the dump with an uninitialized string, however
    it did not reduce the number of common global parameters
    which caused the incorrect (unable to parse) register dump

    btrfs: prevent subvol with swapfile from being deleted

    commit 60021bd754c6ca0addc6817994f20290a321d8d6 upstream.

    A subvolume with an active swapfile must not be deleted otherwise it
    would not be possible to deactivate it.

    After the subvolume is deleted, we cannot swapoff the swapfile in this
    deleted subvolume because the path is unreachable.  The swapfile is
    still active and holding references, the filesystem cannot be unmounted.

    The test looks like this:

      mkfs.btrfs -f $dev > /dev/null
      mount $dev $mnt

      btrfs sub create $mnt/subvol
      touch $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      chmod 600 $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      chattr +C $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      dd if=/dev/zero of=$mnt/subvol/swapfile bs=1K count=4096
      mkswap $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      swapon $mnt/subvol/swapfile

      btrfs sub delete $mnt/subvol
      swapoff $mnt/subvol/swapfile  # failed: No such file or directory
      swapoff --all

      unmount $mnt                  # target is busy.

    To prevent above issue, we simply check that whether the subvolume
    contains any active swapfile, and stop the deleting process.  This
    behavior is like snapshot ioctl dealing with a swapfile.

    btrfs: avoid defragging extents whose next extents are not targets

    commit 75a36a7d3ea904cef2e5b56af0c58cc60dcf947a upstream.

    [BUG]
    There is a report that autodefrag is defragging single sector, which
    is completely waste of IO, and no help for defragging:

       btrfs-cleaner-808 defrag_one_locked_range: root=256 ino=651122 start=0 len=4096

    [CAUSE]
    In defrag_collect_targets(), we check if the current range (A) can be merged
    with next one (B).

    If mergeable, we will add range A into target for defrag.

    However there is a catch for autodefrag, when checking mergeability
    against range B, we intentionally pass 0 as @newer_than, hoping to get a
    higher chance to merge with the next extent.

    But in the next iteration, range B will looked up by defrag_lookup_extent(),
    with non-zero @newer_than.

    And if range B is not really newer, it will rejected directly, causing
    only range A being defragged, while we expect to defrag both range A and
    B.

    [FIX]
    Since the root cause is the difference in check condition of
    defrag_check_next_extent() and defrag_collect_targets(), we fix it by:

    1. Pass @newer_than to defrag_check_next_extent()
    2. Pass @extent_thresh to defrag_check_next_extent()

    This makes the check between defrag_collect_targets() and
    defrag_check_next_extent() more consistent.

    While there is still some minor difference, the remaining checks are
    focus on runtime flags like writeback/delalloc, which are mostly
    transient and safe to be checked only in defrag_collect_targets().

      BTRFS error (device sdd3): failed to read chunk tree: -22
      BTRFS error (device sdd3): open_ctree failed

    [CAUSE]
    During btrfs device removal, chunk tree and super block num devs are
    updated in two different transactions:

      btrfs_rm_device()
      |- btrfs_rm_dev_item(device)
      |  |- trans = btrfs_start_transaction()
      |  |  Now we got transaction X
      |  |
      |  |- btrfs_del_item()
      |  |  Now device item is removed from chunk tree
      |  |
      |  |- btrfs_commit_transaction()
      |     Transaction X got committed, super num devs untouched,
      |     but device item removed from chunk tree.
      |     (AKA, super num devs is already incorrect)
      |
      |- cur_devices->num_devices--;
      |- cur_devices->total_devices--;
      |- btrfs_set_super_num_devices()
         All those operations are not in transaction X, thus it will
         only be written back to disk in next transaction.

    So after the transaction X in btrfs_rm_dev_item() committed, but before
    transaction X+1 (which can be minutes away), a power loss happen, then
    we got the super num mismatch.

    [FIX]
    Instead of starting and committing a transaction inside
    btrfs_rm_dev_item(), start a transaction in side btrfs_rm_device() and
    pass it to btrfs_rm_dev_item().

    And only commit the transaction after everything is done.

    btrfs: zoned: traverse devices under chunk_mutex in btrfs_can_activate_zone

    commit 0b9e66762aa0cda2a9c2d5542d64e04dac528fa6 upstream.

    btrfs_can_activate_zone() can be called with the device_list_mutex already
    held, which will lead to a deadlock:

    insert_dev_extents() // Takes device_list_mutex
    `-> insert_dev_extent()
     `-> btrfs_insert_empty_item()
      `-> btrfs_insert_empty_items()
       `-> btrfs_search_slot()
        `-> btrfs_cow_block()
         `-> __btrfs_cow_block()
          `-> btrfs_alloc_tree_block()
           `-> btrfs_reserve_extent()
            `-> find_free_extent()
             `-> find_free_extent_update_loop()
              `-> can_allocate_chunk()
               `-> btrfs_can_activate_zone() // Takes device_list_mutex again

    Instead of using the RCU on fs_devices->device_list we
    can use fs_devices->alloc_list, protected by the chunk_mutex to traverse
    the list of active devices.

    We are in the chunk allocation thread. The newer chunk allocation
    happens from the devices in the fs_device->alloc_list protected by the
    chunk_mutex.

      btrfs_create_chunk()
        lockdep_assert_held(&info->chunk_mutex);
        gather_device_info
          list_for_each_entry(device, &fs_devices->alloc_list, dev_alloc_list)

    Also, a device that reappears after the mount won't join the alloc_list
    yet and, it will be in the dev_list, which we don't want to consider in
    the context of the chunk alloc.

    btrfs: fix qgroup reserve overflow the qgroup limit

    commit b642b52d0b50f4d398cb4293f64992d0eed2e2ce upstream.

    We use extent_changeset->bytes_changed in qgroup_reserve_data() to record
    how many bytes we set for EXTENT_QGROUP_RESERVED state. Currently the
    bytes_changed is set as "unsigned int", and it will overflow if we try to
    fallocate a range larger than 4GiB. The result is we reserve less bytes
    and eventually break the qgroup limit.

    Unlike regular buffered/direct write, which we use one changeset for
    each ordered extent, which can never be larger than 256M.  For
    fallocate, we use one changeset for the whole range, thus it no longer
    respects the 256M per extent limit, and caused the problem.

    The following example test script reproduces the problem:

      $ cat qgroup-overflow.sh
      #!/bin/bash

      DEV=/dev/sdj
      MNT=/mnt/sdj

      mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
      mount $DEV $MNT

      # Set qgroup limit to 2GiB.
      btrfs quota enable $MNT
      btrfs qgroup limit 2G $MNT

      # Try to fallocate a 3GiB file. This should fail.
      echo
      echo "Try to fallocate a 3GiB file..."
      fallocate -l 3G $MNT/3G.file

      # Try to fallocate a 5GiB file.
      echo
      echo "Try to fallocate a 5GiB file..."
      fallocate -l 5G $MNT/5G.file

      # See we break the qgroup limit.
      echo
      sync
      btrfs qgroup show -r $MNT

      umount $MNT

    When running the test:

      $ ./qgroup-overflow.sh
      (...)

      Try to fallocate a 3GiB file...
      fallocate: fallocate failed: Disk quota exceeded

      Try to fallocate a 5GiB file...

      qgroupid         rfer         excl     max_rfer
      --------         ----         ----     --------
      0/5           5.00GiB      5.00GiB      2.00GiB

    Since we have no control of how bytes_changed is used, it's better to
    set it to u64.

    x86/speculation: Restore speculation related MSRs during S3 resume

    commit e2a1256b17b16f9b9adf1b6fea56819e7b68e463 upstream.

    After resuming from suspend-to-RAM, the MSRs that control CPU's
    speculative execution behavior are not being restored on the boot CPU.

    These MSRs are used to mitigate speculative execution vulnerabilities.
    Not restoring them correctly may leave the CPU vulnerable.  Secondary
    CPU's MSRs are correctly being restored at S3 resume by
    identify_secondary_cpu().

    During S3 resume, restore these MSRs for boot CPU when restoring its
    processor state.

    x86/pm: Save the MSR validity status at context setup

    commit 73924ec4d560257004d5b5116b22a3647661e364 upstream.

    The mechanism to save/restore MSRs during S3 suspend/resume checks for
    the MSR validity during suspend, and only restores the MSR if its a
    valid MSR.  This is not optimal, as an invalid MSR will unnecessarily
    throw an exception for every suspend cycle.  The more invalid MSRs,
    higher the impact will be.

    Check and save the MSR validity at setup.  This ensures that only valid
    MSRs that are guaranteed to not throw an exception will be attempted
    during suspend.

    io_flush_timeouts() assumes the timeout isn't in progress of triggering

    timeout list and attempts to cancel it.

    Leave it on the list and let the normal timeout cancelation take care

    mm/mempolicy: fix mpol_new leak in shared_policy_replace

    commit 4ad099559b00ac01c3726e5c95dc3108ef47d03e upstream.

    If mpol_new is allocated but not used in restart loop, mpol_new will be
    freed via mpol_put before returning to the caller.  But refcnt is not
    initialized yet, so mpol_put could not do the right things and might
    leak the unused mpol_new.  This would happen if mempolicy was updated on
    the shared shmem file while the sp->lock has been dropped during the
    memory allocation.

    This issue could be triggered easily with the below code snippet if
    there are many processes doing the below work at the same time:

      shmid = shmget((key_t)5566, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
      shm = shmat(shmid, 0, 0);
      loop many times {
        mbind(shm, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_LOCAL, mask, maxnode, 0);
        mbind(shm + 128 * PAGE_SIZE, 128 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_DEFAULT, mask,

    mmmremap.c: avoid pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0)

    commit 01e67e04c28170c47700c2c226d732bbfedb1ad0 upstream.

    If an mremap() syscall with old_size=0 ends up in move_page_tables(), it
    will call invalidate_range_start()/invalidate_range_end() unnecessarily,
    i.e.  with an empty range.

    This causes a WARN in KVM's mmu_notifier.  In the past, empty ranges
    have been diagnosed to be off-by-one bugs, hence the WARNing.  Given the
    low (so far) number of unique reports, the benefits of detecting more
    buggy callers seem to outweigh the cost of having to fix cases such as
    this one, where userspace is doing something silly.  In this particular
    case, an early return from move_page_tables() is enough to fix the
    issue.

    highmem: fix checks in __kmap_local_sched_{in,out}

    commit 66f133ceab7456c789f70a242991ed1b27ba1c3d upstream.

    When CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL is enabled __kmap_local_sched_{in,out} check
    that even slots in the tsk->kmap_ctrl.pteval are unmapped.  The slots are
    initialized with 0 value, but the check is done with pte_none.  0 pte
    however does not necessarily mean that pte_none will return true.  e.g.
    on xtensa it returns false, resulting in the following runtime warnings:

    lz4: fix LZ4_decompress_safe_partial read out of bound

    commit eafc0a02391b7b36617b36c97c4b5d6832cf5e24 upstream.

    When partialDecoding, it is EOF if we've either filled the output buffer
    or can't proceed with reading an offset for following match.

    In some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted,
    UAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
    may lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has
    fixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.

    current decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping
    lib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd
    better fix it first.

    mmc: core: Fixup support for writeback-cache for eMMC and SD

    commit 08ebf903af57cda6d773f3dd1671b64f73b432b8 upstream.

    During the card initialization process, the mmc core checks whether the
    eMMC/SD card supports an internal writeback-cache and then enables it
    inside the card.

    Unfortunately, this isn't according to what the mmc core reports to the
    upper block layer. Instead, the writeback-cache support with REQ_FLUSH and
    REQ_FUA, are being enabled depending on whether the host supports the CMD23
    (MMC_CAP_CMD23) and whether an eMMC supports the reliable-write command.

    This is wrong and it may also sound awkward. In fact, it's a remnant
    from when both eMMC/SD cards didn't have dedicated commands/support to
    control the internal writeback-cache. In other words, it was the best we
    could do at that point in time.

    To fix the problem, but also without breaking backwards compatibility,
    let's align the REQ_FLUSH support with whether the writeback-cache became
    successfully enabled - for both eMMC and SD cards.

    mmc: renesas_sdhi: don't overwrite TAP settings when HS400 tuning is complete

    commit 03e59b1e2f56245163b14c69e0a830c24b1a3a47 upstream.

    When HS400 tuning is complete and HS400 is going to be activated, we
    have to keep the current number of TAPs and should not overwrite them
    with a hardcoded value. This was probably a copy&paste mistake when
    upporting HS400 support from the BSP.

    mmc: block: Check for errors after write on SPI

    commit 5d435933376962b107bd76970912e7e80247dcc7 upstream.

    Introduce a SEND_STATUS check for writes through SPI to not mark
    an unsuccessful write as successful.

    Since SPI SD/MMC does not have states, after a write, the card will
    just hold the line LOW until it is ready again. The driver marks the
    write therefore as completed as soon as it reads something other than
    all zeroes.
    The driver does not distinguish from a card no longer signalling busy
    and it being disconnected (and the line being pulled-up by the host).
    This lead to writes being marked as successful when disconnecting
    a busy card.
    Now the card is ensured to be still connected by an additional CMD13,
    just like non-SPI is ensured to go back to TRAN state.

    While at it and since we already poll for the post-write status anyway,
    we might as well check for SPIs error bits (any of them).

    The disconnecting card problem is reproducable for me after continuous
    write activity and randomly disconnecting, around every 20-50 tries
    on SPI DS for some card.

    Fix this by introducing the local variable port_id to store the port ID
    value before executing mpt3sas_transport_port_remove(). This local variable
    is then used in the call to ioc_info() instead of dereferencing the freed
    port structure.

    perf session: Remap buf if there is no space for event

    perf unwind: Don't show unwind error messages when augmenting frame pointer stack

    Commit Fixes: b9f6fbb3b2c29736 ("perf arm64: Inject missing frames when

    DWARF unwind that improved the frame pointer stack in most scenarios.

    It's expected that the unwind will fail sometimes, but this shouldn't be
    reported as an error. It only works when the return address can be
    determined from the contents of the link register alone.

    Fix the error shown when the unwinder requires extra registers by adding
    a new flag that suppresses error messages. This flag is not set in the
    normal --call-graph=dwarf unwind mode so that behavior is not changed.

    iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference

    [ Upstream commit 71ff461c3f41f6465434b9e980c01782763e7ad8 ]

    Commit 3f6634d997db ("iommu: Use right way to retrieve iommu_ops") started
    triggering a NULL pointer dereference for some omap variants:

    __iommu_probe_device from probe_iommu_group+0x2c/0x38
    probe_iommu_group from bus_for_each_dev+0x74/0xbc
    bus_for_each_dev from bus_iommu_probe+0x34/0x2e8
    bus_iommu_probe from bus_set_iommu+0x80/0xc8
    bus_set_iommu from omap_iommu_init+0x88/0xcc
    omap_iommu_init from do_one_initcall+0x44/0x24

    This is caused by omap iommu probe returning 0 instead of ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)
    as noted by Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@ziepe.ca>.

    Looks like the regression already happened with an earlier commit
    6785eb9105e3 ("iommu/omap: Convert to probe/release_device() call-backs")
    that changed the function return type and missed converting one place.

    drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state

    [ Upstream commit aadb22ba2f656581b2f733deb3a467c48cc618f6 ]

    In get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..) if
    cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(),
    the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb).
    Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by
    return value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.

    What's worse, the same problem goes even further: skb can also be
    freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below.
    Thus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.

    My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done
    and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen.
    So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.

    v2 reports a compilation warning. This v3 fixed this warning and built
    successfully in my local environment with no additional warnings.

    bpf: Support dual-stack sockets in bpf_tcp_check_syncookie

    [ Upstream commit 2e8702cc0cfa1080f29fd64003c00a3e24ac38de ]

    bpf_tcp_gen_syncookie looks at the IP version in the IP header and
    validates the address family of the socket. It supports IPv4 packets in
    AF_INET6 dual-stack sockets.

    On the other hand, bpf_tcp_check_syncookie looks only at the address
    family of the socket, ignoring the real IP version in headers, and
    validates only the packet size. This implementation has some drawbacks:

    1. Packets are not validated properly, allowing a BPF program to trick
       bpf_tcp_check_syncookie into handling an IPv6 packet on an IPv4
       socket.

    2. Dual-stack sockets fail the checks on IPv4 packets. IPv4 clients end
       up receiving a SYNACK with the cookie, but the following ACK gets
       dropped.

    This patch fixes these issues by changing the checks in
    bpf_tcp_check_syncookie to match the ones in bpf_tcp_gen_syncookie. IP
    version from the header is taken into account, and it is validated
    properly with address family.

    qede: confirm skb is allocated before using

    [ Upstream commit 4e910dbe36508654a896d5735b318c0b88172570 ]

    qede_build_skb() assumes build_skb() always works and goes straight
    to skb_reserve(). However, build_skb() can fail under memory pressure.
    This results in a kernel panic because the skb to reserve is NULL.

    Add a check in case build_skb() failed to allocate and return NULL.

    The NULL return is handled correctly in callers to qede_build_skb().

    net: sfc: fix using uninitialized xdp tx_queue

    [ Upstream commit fb5833d81e4333294add35d3ac7f7f52a7bf107f ]

    In some cases, xdp tx_queue can get used before initialization.
    1. interface up/down
    2. ring buffer size change

    When CPU cores are lower than maximum number of channels of sfc driver,
    it creates new channels only for XDP.

    When an interface is up or ring buffer size is changed, all channels
    are initialized.
    But xdp channels are always initialized later.
    So, the below scenario is possible.
    Packets are received to rx queue of normal channels and it is acted
    XDP_TX and tx_queue of xdp channels get used.
    But these tx_queues are not initialized yet.
    If so, TX DMA or queue error occurs.

    In order to avoid this problem.
    1. initializes xdp tx_queues earlier than other rx_queue in
    efx_start_channels().
    2. checks whether tx_queue is initialized or not in efx_xdp_tx_buffers().

    Splat looks like:
       sfc 0000:08:00.1 enp8s0f1np1: TX queue 10 spurious TX completion id 250
       sfc 0000:08:00.1 enp8s0f1np1: resetting (RECOVER_OR_ALL)

    rxrpc: fix a race in rxrpc_exit_net()

    CPU0                                                 CPU1

    rxrpc_exit_net()

      rxnet->live = false;
      del_timer_sync(&rxnet->peer_keepalive_timer);

    net: openvswitch: fix leak of nested actions

    [ Upstream commit 1f30fb9166d4f15a1aa19449b9da871fe0ed4796 ]

    While parsing user-provided actions, openvswitch module may dynamically
    allocate memory and store pointers in the internal copy of the actions.
    So this memory has to be freed while destroying the actions.

    Currently there are only two such actions: ct() and set().  However,
    there are many actions that can hold nested lists of actions and
    ovs_nla_free_flow_actions() just jumps over them leaking the memory.

    For example, removal of the flow with the following actions will lead
    to a leak of the memory allocated by nf_ct_tmpl_alloc():

      actions:clone(ct(commit),0)

    Non-freed set() action may also leak the 'dst' structure for the
    tunnel info including device references.

    Under certain conditions with a high rate of flow rotation that may
    cause significant memory leak problem (2MB per second in reporter's
    case).  The problem is also hard to mitigate, because the user doesn't
    have direct control over the datapath flows generated by OVS.

    Fix that by iterating over all the nested actions and freeing
    everything that needs to be freed recursively.

    New build time assertion should protect us from this problem if new
    actions will be added in the future.

    Unfortunately, openvswitch module doesn't use NLA_F_NESTED, so all
    attributes has to be explicitly checked.  sample() and clone() actions
    are mixing extra attributes into the user-provided action list.  That
    prevents some code generalization too.

    net: ethernet: mv643xx: Fix over zealous checking of_get_mac_address()

    [ Upstream commit 11f8e7c122ce013fa745029fa8c94c6db69c2e54 ]

    There is often not a MAC address available in an EEPROM accessible by
    Linux with Marvell devices. Instead the bootload has the MAC address
    and directly programs it into the hardware. So don't consider an error
    from of_get_mac_address() has fatal. However, the check was added for
    the case where there is a MAC address in an the EEPROM, but the EEPROM
    has not probed yet, and -EPROBE_DEFER is returned. In that case the
    error should be returned. So make the check specific to this error
    code.

    net: openvswitch: don't send internal clone attribute to the userspace.

    [ Upstream commit 3f2a3050b4a3e7f32fc0ea3c9b0183090ae00522 ]

    'OVS_CLONE_ATTR_EXEC' is an internal attribute that is used for
    performance optimization inside the kernel.  It's added by the kernel
    while parsing user-provided actions and should not be sent during the
    flow dump as it's not part of the uAPI.

    The issue doesn't cause any significant problems to the ovs-vswitchd
    process, because reported actions are not really used in the
    application lifecycle and only supposed to be shown to a human via
    ovs-dpctl flow dump.  However, the action list is still incorrect
    and causes the following error if the user wants to look at the
    datapath flows:

      # ovs-dpctl add-dp system@ovs-system
      # ovs-dpctl add-flow "<flow match>" "clone(ct(commit),0)"
      # ovs-dpctl dump-flows
      <flow match>, packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
        actions:clone(bad length 4, expected -1 for: action0(01 00 00 00),
                      ct(commit),0)

    With the fix:

      # ovs-dpctl dump-flows
      <flow match>, packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
        actions:clone(ct(commit),0)

    Additionally fixed an incorrect attribute name in the comment.

    ice: clear cmd_type_offset_bsz for TX rings

    [ Upstream commit e19778e6c911691856447c3bf9617f00b3e1347f ]

    Currently when XDP rings are created, each descriptor gets its DD bit
    set, which turns out to be the wrong approach as it can lead to a
    situation where more descriptors get cleaned than it was supposed to,
    e.g. when AF_XDP busy poll is run with a large batch size. In this
    situation, the driver would request for more buffers than it is able to
    handle.

    Fix this by not setting the DD bits in ice_xdp_alloc_setup_rings(). They
    should be initialized to zero instead.

    [ Upstream commit 05ef6813b234db3196f083b91db3963f040b65bb ]

    Disable check for queue being enabled in ice_vc_dis_qs_msg, because
    there could be a case when queues were created, but were not enabled.
    We still need to delete those queues.

    Normal workflow for VF looks like:
    Enable path:
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ADD_ETH_ADDR (opcode 10)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES (opcode 6)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES (opcode 8)

    Disable path:
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES (opcode 9)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DEL_ETH_ADDR (opcode 11)

    The issue appears only in stress conditions when VF is enabled and
    disabled very fast.
    Eventually there will be a case, when queues are created by
    VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES, but are not enabled by
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.
    In turn, these queues are not deleted by VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES,
    because there is a check whether queues are enabled in
    ice_vc_dis_qs_msg.

    When we bring up the VF again, we will see the "Failed to set LAN Tx queue
    context" error during VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES step. This
    happens because old 16 queues were not deleted and VF requests to create
    16 more, but ice_sched_get_free_qparent in ice_ena_vsi_txq would fail to
    find a parent node for first newly requested queue (because all nodes
    are allocated to 16 old queues).

    Testing Hints:

    Just enable and disable VF fast enough, so it would be disabled before
    reaching VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.

    ice: Set txq_teid to ICE_INVAL_TEID on ring creation

    [ Upstream commit ccfee1822042b87e5135d33cad8ea353e64612d2 ]

    When VF is freshly created, but not brought up, ring->txq_teid
    value is by default set to 0.
    But 0 is a valid TEID. On some platforms the Root Node of
    Tx scheduler has a TEID = 0. This can cause issues as shown below.

    The proper way is to set ring->txq_teid to ICE_INVAL_TEID (0xFFFFFFFF).

    Testing Hints:
    echo 1 > /sys/class/net/ens785f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    ip link set dev ens785f0v0 up
    ip link set dev ens785f0v0 down

    If we have freshly created VF and quickly turn it on and off, so there
    would be no time to reach VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES stage, then
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES stage will fail with error:
    [  639.531454] disable queue 89 failed 14
    [  639.532233] Failed to disable LAN Tx queues, error: ICE_ERR_AQ_ERROR
    [  639.533107] ice 0000:02:00.0: Failed to stop Tx ring 0 on VSI 5

    The reason for the fail is that we are trying to send AQ command to
    delete queue 89, which has never been created and receive an "invalid
    argument" error from firmware.

    As this queue has never been created, it's teid and ring->txq_teid
    have default value 0.
    ice_dis_vsi_txq has a check against non-existent queues:

    node = ice_sched_find_node_by_teid(pi->root, q_teids[i]);
    if (!node)
            continue;

    But on some platforms the Root Node of Tx scheduler has a teid = 0.
    Hence, ice_sched_find_node_by_teid finds a node with teid = 0 (it is
    pi->root), and we go further to submit an erroneous request to firmware.

    [ Upstream commit 4d809f69695d4e7d1378b3a072fa9aef23123018 ]

    The documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and s_lock
    need to be held when calling that function.  It also asserts using lockdep
    that both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in
    Fixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no
    longer covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing
    and also possibly in a race condition.

    Also remove redundant checks in the XDP redirect callback to validate the
    txr and the flag that indicates the ring supports XDP. The modulo
    arithmetic on 'tx_nr_rings_xdp' already guarantees the derived TX
    ring is an XDP ring.  txr is also guaranteed to be valid after checking

    arch/arm64: Fix topology initialization for core scheduling

    [ Upstream commit 5524cbb1bfcdff0cad0aaa9f94e6092002a07259 ]

    Arm64 systems rely on store_cpu_topology() to call update_siblings_masks()
    to transfer the toplogy to the various cpu masks. This needs to be done
    before the call to notify_cpu_starting() which tells the scheduler about
    each cpu found, otherwise the core scheduling data structures are setup
    in a way that does not match the actual topology.

    With smt_mask not setup correctly we bail on `cpumask_weight(smt_mask) == 1`
    for !leaders in:

     notify_cpu_starting()
       cpuhp_invoke_callback_range()
         sched_cpu_starting()
           sched_core_cpu_starting()

    which leads to rq->core not being correctly set for !leader-rq's.

    Without this change stress-ng (which enables core scheduling in its prctl
    tests in newer versions -- i.e. with PR_SCHED_CORE support) causes a warning
    and then a crash (trimmed for legibility):

    In dw_hdmi_imx_probe(), if error happens after dw_hdmi_probe() returns
    successfully, dw_hdmi_remove() should be called where necessary as
    bailout.

    net: stmmac: Fix unset max_speed difference between DT and non-DT platforms

    [ Upstream commit c21cabb0fd0b54b8b54235fc1ecfe1195a23bcb2 ]

    In commit 9cbadf094d9d ("net: stmmac: support max-speed device tree
    property"), when DT platforms don't set "max-speed", max_speed is set to
    -1; for non-DT platforms, it stays the default 0.

    Prior to commit eeef2f6b9f6e ("net: stmmac: Start adding phylink support"),
    the check for a valid max_speed setting was to check if it was greater
    than zero. This commit got it right, but subsequent patches just checked
    for non-zero, which is incorrect for DT platforms.

    In commit 92c3807b9ac3 ("net: stmmac: convert to phylink_get_linkmodes()")
    the conversion switched completely to checking for non-zero value as a
    valid value, which caused 1000base-T to stop getting advertised by
    default.

    Instead of trying to fix all the checks, simply leave max_speed alone if
    DT property parsing fails.

    net: ipv4: fix route with nexthop object delete warning

    [ Upstream commit 6bf92d70e690b7ff12b24f4bfff5e5434d019b82 ]

    FRR folks have hit a kernel warning[1] while deleting routes[2] which is
    caused by trying to delete a route pointing to a nexthop id without
    specifying nhid but matching on an interface. That is, a route is found
    but we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from
    fib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info
    with nexthop object. The call chain is:
     inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a
    nexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on
    the fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any
    matching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are
    managed separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and
    should fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because
    nexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:
     $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32
     1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0

     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32
     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12
     <both should work>

     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 dev dummy0
     <should fail with ESRCH>

    ice: Fix MAC address setting

    [ Upstream commit 2c0069f3f91f125b1b2ce66cc6bea8eb134723c3 ]

    Commit 2ccc1c1ccc671b ("ice: Remove excess error variables") merged
    the usage of 'status' and 'err' variables into single one in
    function ice_set_mac_address(). Unfortunately this causes
    a regression when call of ice_fltr_add_mac() returns -EEXIST because
    this return value does not indicate an error in this case but
    value of 'err' remains to be -EEXIST till the end of the function
    and is returned to caller.

    Prior mentioned commit this does not happen because return value of
    ice_fltr_add_mac() was stored to 'status' variable first and
    if it was -EEXIST then 'err' remains to be zero.

    Fix the problem by reset 'err' to zero when ice_fltr_add_mac()
    returns -EEXIST.

    ice: Clear default forwarding VSI during VSI release

    [ Upstream commit bd8c624c0cd59de0032752ba3001c107bba97f7b ]

    VSI is set as default forwarding one when promisc mode is set for
    PF interface, when PF is switched to switchdev mode or when VF
    driver asks to enable allmulticast or promisc mode for the VF
    interface (when vf-true-promisc-support priv flag is off).
    The third case is buggy because in that case VSI associated with
    VF remains as default one after VF removal.

    Reproducer:
    1. Create VF
       echo 1 > sys/class/net/ens7f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    2. Enable allmulticast or promisc mode on VF
       ip link set ens7f0v0 allmulticast on
       ip link set ens7f0v0 promisc on
    3. Delete VF
       echo 0 > sys/class/net/ens7f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    4. Try to enable promisc mode on PF
       ip link set ens7f0 promisc on

    Although it looks that promisc mode on PF is enabled the opposite
    is true because ice_vsi_sync_fltr() responsible for IFF_PROMISC
    handling first checks if any other VSI is set as default forwarding
    one and if so the function does not do anything. At this point
    it is not possible to enable promisc mode on PF without re-probe
    device.

    To resolve the issue this patch clear default forwarding VSI
    during ice_vsi_release() when the VSI to be released is the default
    one.

    Revert "net: dsa: stop updating master MTU from master.c"

    [ Upstream commit 066dfc4290406b1b0b014ae3267d4266a344efd1 ]

    This reverts commit a1ff94c2973c43bc1e2677ac63ebb15b1d1ff846.

    Switch drivers that don't implement ->port_change_mtu() will cause the
    DSA master to remain with an MTU of 1500, since we've deleted the other
    code path. In turn, this causes a regression for those systems, where
    MTU-sized traffic can no longer be terminated.

    Revert the change taking into account the fact that rtnl_lock() is now
    taken top-level from the callers of dsa_master_setup() and

    skbuff: fix coalescing for page_pool fragment recycling

    [ Upstream commit 1effe8ca4e34c34cdd9318436a4232dcb582ebf4 ]

    Fix a use-after-free when using page_pool with page fragments. We
    encountered this problem during normal RX in the hns3 driver:

    (1) Initially we have three descriptors in the RX queue. The first one
        allocates PAGE1 through page_pool, and the other two allocate one
        half of PAGE2 each. Page references look like this:

                    RX_BD1 _______ PAGE1
                    RX_BD2 _______ PAGE2
                    RX_BD3 _________/

    (2) Handle RX on the first descriptor. Allocate SKB1, eventually added
        to the receive queue by tcp_queue_rcv().

    (3) Handle RX on the second descriptor. Allocate SKB2 and pass it to
        netif_receive_skb():

        netif_receive_skb(SKB2)
          ip_rcv(SKB2)
            SKB3 = skb_clone(SKB2)

        SKB2 and SKB3 share a reference to PAGE2 through
        skb_shinfo()->dataref. The other ref to PAGE2 is still held by
        RX_BD3:

                          SKB2 ---+- PAGE2
                          SKB3 __/   /
                    RX_BD3 _________/

     (3b) Now while handling TCP, coalesce SKB3 with SKB1:

          tcp_v4_rcv(SKB3)
            tcp_try_coalesce(to=SKB1, from=SKB3)    // succeeds
            kfree_skb_partial(SKB3)
              skb_release_data(SKB3)                // drops one dataref

                          SKB1 _____ PAGE1
                               \____
                          SKB2 _____ PAGE2
                                     /
                    RX_BD3 _________/

        In skb_try_coalesce(), __skb_frag_ref() takes a page reference to
        PAGE2, where it should instead have increased the page_pool frag
        reference, pp_frag_count. Without coalescing, when releasing both
        SKB2 and SKB3, a single reference to PAGE2 would be dropped. Now
        when releasing SKB1 and SKB2, two references to PAGE2 will be
        dropped, resulting in underflow.

     (3c) Drop SKB2:

          af_packet_rcv(SKB2)
            consume_skb(SKB2)
              skb_release_data(SKB2)                // drops second dataref
                page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)    // drops one pp_frag_count

                          SKB1 _____ PAGE1
                               \____
                                     PAGE2
                                     /
                    RX_BD3 _________/

    (4) Userspace calls recvmsg()
        Copies SKB1 and releases it. Since SKB3 was coalesced with SKB1, we
        release the SKB3 page as well:

        tcp_eat_recv_skb(SKB1)
          skb_release_data(SKB1)
            page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE1)
            page_pool_return_skb_page(PAGE2)        // drops second pp_frag_count

    (5) PAGE2 is freed, but the third RX descriptor was still using it!
        In our case this causes IOMMU faults, but it would silently corrupt
        memory if the IOMMU was disabled.

    Change the logic that checks whether pp_recycle SKBs can be coalesced.
    We still reject differing pp_recycle between 'from' and 'to' SKBs, but
    in order to avoid the situation described above, we also reject
    coalescing when both 'from' and 'to' are pp_recycled and 'from' is
    cloned.

    The new logic allows coalescing a cloned pp_recycle SKB into a page
    refcounted one, because in this case the release (4) will drop the right
    reference, the one taken by skb_try_coalesce().

    vrf: fix packet sniffing for traffic originating from ip tunnels

    [ Upstream commit 012d69fbfcc739f846766c1da56ef8b493b803b5 ]

    in commit 048939088220
    ("vrf: add mac header for tunneled packets when sniffer is attached")
    an Ethernet header was cooked for traffic originating from tunnel devices.

    However, the header is added based on whether the mac_header is unset
    and ignores cases where the device doesn't expose a mac header to upper
    layers, such as in ip tunnels like ipip and gre.

    Traffic originating from such devices still appears garbled when capturing
    on the vrf device.

    Fix by observing whether the original device exposes a header to upper
    layers, similar to the logic done in af_packet.

    In addition, skb->mac_len needs to be adjusted after adding the Ethernet
    header for the skb_push/pull() surrounding dev_queue_xmit_nit() to work
    on these packets.

    net/tls: fix slab-out-of-bounds bug in decrypt_internal

    net: sfc: add missing xdp queue reinitialization

    [ Upstream commit 059a47f1da93811d37533556d67e72f2261b1127 ]

    After rx/tx ring buffer size is changed, kernel panic occurs when
    it acts XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT.

    When tx/rx ring buffer size is changed(ethtool -G), sfc driver
    reallocates and reinitializes rx and tx queues and their buffer
    (tx_queue->buffer).
    But it misses reinitializing xdp queues(efx->xdp_tx_queues).
    So, while it is acting XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it uses the uninitialized
    tx_queue->buffer.

    A new function efx_set_xdp_channels() is separated from efx_set_channels()
    to handle only xdp queues.

    Splat looks like:

    In commit edb854a3680b ("scsi: core: Reallocate device's budget map on

    reallocated after the slave device depth is configured.

    When the sbitmap is reallocated we use the result from
    scsi_device_max_queue_depth() for the sbitmap size, but don't resize to
    match the actual device queue depth.

    Fix by resizing the sbitmap after reallocating the budget sbitmap. We do
    this instead of init'ing the sbitmap to the device queue depth as the user
    may want to change the queue depth later via sysfs or other.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix potential crash on module unload

    [ Upstream commit 792f232d57ff28bbd5f9c4abe0466b23d5879dc8 ]

    The vmbus driver relies on the panic notifier infrastructure to perform
    some operations when a panic event is detected. Since vmbus can be built
    as module, it is required that the driver handles both registering and
    unregistering such panic notifier callback.

    After commit 74347a99e73a ("x86/Hyper-V: Unload vmbus channel in hv panic callback")
    though, the panic notifier registration is done unconditionally in the module
    initialization routine whereas the unregistering procedure is conditionally
    guarded and executes only if HV_FEATURE_GUEST_CRASH_MSR_AVAILABLE capability
    is set.

    This patch fixes that by unconditionally unregistering the panic notifier
    in the module's exit routine as well.

    mm: fix race between MADV_FREE reclaim and blkdev direct IO read

    commit 6c8e2a256915a223f6289f651d6b926cd7135c9e upstream.

    Problem:
    =======

    Userspace might read the zero-page instead of actual data from a direct IO
    read on a block device if the buffers have been called madvise(MADV_FREE)
    on earlier (this is discussed below) due to a race between page reclaim on
    MADV_FREE and blkdev direct IO read.

    - Race condition:
      ==============

    During page reclaim, the MADV_FREE page check in try_to_unmap_one() checks
    if the page is not dirty, then discards its rmap PTE(s) (vs.  remap back
    if the page is dirty).

    However, after try_to_unmap_one() returns to shrink_page_list(), it might
    keep the page _anyway_ if page_ref_freeze() fails (it expects exactly
    _one_ page reference, from the isolation for page reclaim).

    Well, blkdev_direct_IO() gets references for all pages, and on READ
    operations it only sets them dirty _later_.

    So, if MADV_FREE'd pages (i.e., not dirty) are used as buffers for direct
    IO read from block devices, and page reclaim happens during
    __blkdev_direct_IO[_simple]() exactly AFTER bio_iov_iter_get_pages()
    returns, but BEFORE the pages are set dirty, the situation happens.

    The direct IO read eventually completes.  Now, when userspace reads the
    buffers, the PTE is no longer there and the page fault handler
    do_anonymous_page() services that with the zero-page, NOT the data!

    A synthetic reproducer is provided.

    - Page faults:
      ===========

    If page reclaim happens BEFORE bio_iov_iter_get_pages() the issue doesn't
    happen, because that faults-in all pages as writeable, so
    do_anonymous_page() sets up a new page/rmap/PTE, and that is used by
    direct IO.  The userspace reads don't fault as the PTE is there (thus
    zero-page is not used/setup).

    But if page reclaim happens AFTER it / BEFORE setting pages dirty, the PTE
    is no longer there; the subsequent page faults can't help:

    The data-read from the block device probably won't generate faults due to
    DMA (no MMU) but even in the case it wouldn't use DMA, that happens on
    different virtual addresses (not user-mapped addresses) because `struct
    bio_vec` stores `struct page` to figure addresses out (which are different
    from user-mapped addresses) for the read.

    Thus userspace reads (to user-mapped addresses) still fault, then
    do_anonymous_page() gets another `struct page` that would address/ map to
    other memory than the `struct page` used by `struct bio_vec` for the read.
    (The original `struct page` is not available, since it wasn't freed, as
    page_ref_freeze() failed due to more page refs.  And even if it were
    available, its data cannot be trusted anymore.)

    Solution:
    ========

    One solution is to check for the expected page reference count in
    try_to_unmap_one().

    There should be one reference from the isolation (that is also checked in
    shrink_page_list() with page_ref_freeze()) plus one or more references
    from page mapping(s) (put in discard: label).  Further references mean
    that rmap/PTE cannot be unmapped/nuked.

    (Note: there might be more than one reference from mapping due to
    fork()/clone() without CLONE_VM, which use the same `struct page` for
    references, until the copy-on-write page gets copied.)

    So, additional page references (e.g., from direct IO read) now prevent the
    rmap/PTE from being unmapped/dropped; similarly to the page is not freed
    per shrink_page_list()/page_ref_freeze()).

    - Races and Barriers:
      ==================

    The new check in try_to_unmap_one() should be safe in races with
    bio_iov_iter_get_pages() in get_user_pages() fast and slow paths, as it's
    done under the PTE lock.

    The fast path doesn't take the lock, but it checks if the PTE has changed
    and if so, it drops the reference and leaves the page for the slow path
    (which does take that lock).

    The fast path requires synchronization w/ full memory barrier: it writes
    the page reference count first then it reads the PTE later, while
    try_to_unmap() writes PTE first then it reads page refcount.

    And a second barrier is needed, as the page dirty flag should not be read
    before the page reference count (as in __remove_mapping()).  (This can be
    a load memory barrier only; no writes are involved.)

    - Huge Pages:
      ==========

    Regarding transparent hugepages, that logic shouldn't change, as MADV_FREE
    (aka lazyfree) pages are PageAnon() && !PageSwapBacked()
    (madvise_free_pte_range() -> mark_page_lazyfree() -> lru_lazyfree_fn())
    thus should reach shrink_page_list() -> split_huge_page_to_list() before
    try_to_unmap[_one](), so it deals with normal pages only.

    (And in case unlikely/TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD/split_huge_pmd_address() happens,
    which should not or be rare, the page refcount should be greater than
    mapcount: the head page is referenced by tail pages.  That also prevents
    checking the head `page` then incorrectly call page_remove_rmap(subpage)
    for a tail page, that isn't even in the shrink_page_list()'s page_list (an
    effect of split huge pmd/pmvw), as it might happen today in this unlikely
    scenario.)

    MADV_FREE'd buffers:
    ===================

    So, back to the "if MADV_FREE pages are used as buffers" note.  The case
    is arguable, and subject to multiple interpretations.

    The madvise(2) manual page on the MADV_FREE advice value says:

    1) 'After a successful MADV_FREE ... data will be lost when
       the kernel frees the pages.'
    2) 'the free operation will be canceled if the caller writes
       into the page' / 'subsequent writes ... will succeed and
       then [the] kernel cannot free those dirtied pages'
    3) 'If there is no subsequent write, the kernel can free the
       pages at any time.'

    Thoughts, questions, considerations... respectively:

    1) Since the kernel didn't actually free the page (page_ref_freeze()
       failed), should the data not have been lost? (on userspace read.)
    2) Should writes performed by the direct IO read be able to cancel
       the free operation?
       - Should the direct IO read be considered as 'the caller' too,
         as it's been requested by 'the caller'?
       - Should the bio technique to dirty pages on return to userspace
         (bio_check_pages_dirty() is called/used by __blkdev_direct_IO())
         be considered in another/special way here?
    3) Should an upcoming write from a previously requested direct IO
       read be considered as a subsequent write, so the kernel should
       not free the pages? (as it's known at the time of page reclaim.)

    And lastly:

    Technically, the last point would seem a reasonable consideration and
    balance, as the madvise(2) manual page apparently (and fairly) seem to
    assume that 'writes' are memory access from the userspace process (not
    explicitly considering writes from the kernel or its corner cases; again,
    fairly)..  plus the kernel fix implementation for the corner case of the
    largely 'non-atomic write' encompassed by a direct IO read operation, is
    relatively simple; and it helps.

    Ceph/TCMalloc:
    =============

    For documentation purposes, the use case driving the analysis/fix is Ceph
    on Ubuntu 18.04, as the TCMalloc library there still uses MADV_FREE to
    release unused memory to the system from the mmap'ed page heap (might be
    committed back/used again; it's not munmap'ed.) - PageHeap::DecommitSpan()
    -> TCMalloc_SystemRelease() -> madvise() - PageHeap::CommitSpan() ->
    TCMalloc_SystemCommit() -> do nothing.

    Note: TCMalloc switched back to MADV_DONTNEED a few commits after the
    release in Ubuntu 18.04 (google-perftools/gperftools 2.5), so the issue
    just 'disappeared' on Ceph on later Ubuntu releases but is still present
    in the kernel, and can be hit by other use cases.

    The observed issue seems to be the old Ceph bug #22464 [1], where checksum
    mismatches are observed (and instrumentation with buffer dumps shows
    zero-pages read from mmap'ed/MADV_FREE'd page ranges).

    The issue in Ceph was reasonably deemed a kernel bug (comment #50) and
    mostly worked around with a retry mechanism, but other parts of Ceph could
    still hit that (rocksdb).  Anyway, it's less likely to be hit again as
    TCMalloc switched out of MADV_FREE by default.

    (Some kernel versions/reports from the Ceph bug, and relation with
    the MADV_FREE introduction/changes; TCMalloc versions not checked.)
    - 4.4 good
    - 4.5 (madv_free: introduction)
    - 4.9 bad
    - 4.10 good? maybe a swapless system
    - 4.12 (madv_free: no longer free instantly on swapless systems)
    - 4.13 bad

    parisc: Fix patch code locking and flushing

    [ Upstream commit a9fe7fa7d874a536e0540469f314772c054a0323 ]

    This change fixes the following:

    1) The flags variable is not initialized. Always use raw_spin_lock_irqsave
    and raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore to serialize patching.

    2) flush_kernel_vmap_range is primarily intended for DMA flushes. Since
    __patch_text_multiple is often called with interrupts disabled, it is
    better to directly call flush_kernel_dcache_range_asm and
    flush_kernel_icache_range_asm. This avoids an extra call.

    3) The final call to flush_icache_range is unnecessary.

    [ Upstream commit 515dcdcd48736576c6f5c197814da6f81c60a21e ]

    The concern is that since nfsiod is sometimes required to kick off a
    commit, it can get locked up waiting forever in mempool_alloc() instead
    of failing gracefully and leaving the commit until later.

    Try to allocate from the slab first, with GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NORETRY,
    then fall back to a non-blocking attempt to allocate from the memory
    pool.

    jfs: prevent NULL deref in diFree

    [ Upstream commit a53046291020ec41e09181396c1e829287b48d47 ]

    Add validation check for JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap to prevent a NULL deref
    in diFree since diFree uses it without do any validations.
    When function jfs_mount calls diMount to initialize fileset inode
    allocation map, it can fail and JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap won't be
    initialized. Then it calls diFreeSpecial to close fileset inode allocation
    map inode and it will flow into jfs_evict_inode. Function jfs_evict_inode
    just validates JFS_SBI(inode->i_sb)->ipimap, then calls diFree. diFree use
    JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap directly, then it will cause a NULL deref.

    virtio_console: eliminate anonymous module_init & module_exit

    [ Upstream commit fefb8a2a941338d871e2d83fbd65fbfa068857bd ]

    Eliminate anonymous module_init() and module_exit(), which can lead to
    confusion or ambiguity when reading System.map, crashes/oops/bugs,
    or an initcall_debug log.

    Give each of these init and exit functions unique driver-specific
    names to eliminate the anonymous names.

    Example 1: (System.map)
     ffffffff832fc78c t init
     ffffffff832fc79e t init
     ffffffff832fc8f8 t init

    Example 2: (initcall_debug log)
     calling  init+0x0/0x12 @ 1
     initcall init+0x0/0x12 returned 0 after 15 usecs
     calling  init+0x0/0x60 @ 1
     initcall init+0x0/0x60 returned 0 after 2 usecs

    serial: samsung_tty: do not unlock port->lock for uart_write_wakeup()

    [ Upstream commit 988c7c00691008ea1daaa1235680a0da49dab4e8 ]

    The commit c15c3747ee32 (serial: samsung: fix potential soft lockup
    during uart write) added an unlock of port->lock before
    uart_write_wakeup() and a lock after it. It was always problematic to
    write data from tty_ldisc_ops::write_wakeup and it was even documented
    that way. We fixed the line disciplines to conform to this recently.
    So if there is still a missed one, we should fix them instead of this
    workaround.

    On the top of that, s3c24xx_serial_tx_dma_complete() in this driver
    still holds the port->lock while calling uart_write_wakeup().

    So revert the wrap added by the commit above.

    x86/Kconfig: Do not allow CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI=y with llvm-objcopy

    [ Upstream commit aaeed6ecc1253ce1463fa1aca0b70a4ccbc9fa75 ]

    There are two outstanding issues with CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI and
    llvm-objcopy, with similar root causes:

    1. llvm-objcopy does not properly convert .note.gnu.property when going
       from x86_64 to x86_x32, resulting in a corrupted section when
       linking:

       https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1141

    2. llvm-objcopy produces corrupted compressed debug sections when going
       from x86_64 to x86_x32, also resulting in an error when linking:

       https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/514

    After commit 41c5ef31ad71 ("x86/ibt: Base IBT bits"), the
    .note.gnu.property section is always generated when
    CONFIG_X86_KERNEL_IBT is enabled, which causes the first issue to become
    visible with an allmodconfig build:

      ld.lld: error: arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime-x32.o:(.note.gnu.property+0x1c): program property is too short

    To avoid this error, do not allow CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI to be selected when
    using llvm-objcopy. If the two issues ever get fixed in llvm-objcopy,
    this can be turned into a feature check.

    Both cases are due to a call_on_stack() calling a __noreturn function.
    Since that's an inline asm, GCC can't do anything about the
    instructions after the CALL. Therefore put in an explicit
    ASM_REACHABLE annotation to make sure objtool and gcc are consistently
    confused about control flow.

    NFS: swap-out must always use STABLE writes.

    [ Upstream commit c265de257f558a05c1859ee9e3fed04883b9ec0e ]

    The commit handling code is not safe against memory-pressure deadlocks
    when writing to swap.  In particular, nfs_commitdata_alloc() blocks
    indefinitely waiting for memory, and this can consume all available
    workqueue threads.

    swap-out most likely uses STABLE writes anyway as COND_STABLE indicates
    that a stable write should be used if the write fits in a single
    request, and it normally does.  However if we ever swap with a small
    wsize, or gather unusually large numbers of pages for a single write,
    this might change.

    For safety, make it explicit in the code that direct writes used for swap
    must always use FLUSH_STABLE.

    NFS: swap IO handling is slightly different for O_DIRECT IO

    [ Upstream commit 64158668ac8b31626a8ce48db4cad08496eb8340 ]

    1/ Taking the i_rwsem for swap IO triggers lockdep warnings regarding
       possible deadlocks with "fs_reclaim".  These deadlocks could, I believe,
       eventuate if a buffered read on the swapfile was attempted.

       We don't need coherence with the page cache for a swap file, and
       buffered writes are forbidden anyway.  There is no other need for
       i_rwsem during direct IO.  So never take it for swap_rw()

    2/ generic_write_checks() explicitly forbids writes to swap, and
       performs checks that are not needed for swap.  So bypass it
       for swap_rw().

    SUNRPC: remove scheduling boost for "SWAPPER" tasks.

    [ Upstream commit a80a8461868905823609be97f91776a26befe839 ]

    Currently, tasks marked as "swapper" tasks get put to the front of
    non-priority rpc_queues, and are sorted earlier than non-swapper tasks on
    the transport's ->xmit_queue.

    This is pointless as currently *all* tasks for a mount that has swap
    enabled on *any* file are marked as "swapper" tasks.  So the net result
    is that the non-priority rpc_queues are reverse-ordered (LIFO).

    This scheduling boost is not necessary to avoid deadlocks, and hurts
    fairness, so remove it.  If there were a need to expedite some requests,
    the tk_priority mechanism is a more appropriate tool.

    SUNRPC/xprt: async tasks mustn't block waiting for memory

    [ Upstream commit a721035477fb5fb8abc738fbe410b07c12af3dc5 ]

    When memory is short, new worker threads cannot be created and we depend
    on the minimum one rpciod thread to be able to handle everything.  So it
    must not block waiting for memory.

    xprt_dynamic_alloc_slot can block indefinitely.  This can tie up all
    workqueue threads and NFS can deadlock.  So when called from a
    workqueue, set __GFP_NORETRY.

    The rdma alloc_slot already does not block.  However it sets the error
    to -EAGAIN suggesting this will trigger a sleep.  It does not.  As we
    can see in call_reserveresult(), only -ENOMEM causes a sleep.  -EAGAIN
    causes immediate retry.

    clk: Enforce that disjoints limits are invalid

    [ Upstream commit 10c46f2ea914202482d19cf80dcc9c321c9ff59b ]

    If we were to have two users of the same clock, doing something like:

    clk_set_rate_range(user1, 1000, 2000);
    clk_set_rate_range(user2, 3000, 4000);

    The second call would fail with -EINVAL, preventing from getting in a
    situation where we end up with impossible limits.

    However, this is never explicitly checked against and enforced, and
    works by relying on an undocumented behaviour of clk_set_rate().

    Indeed, on the first clk_set_rate_range will make sure the current clock
    rate is within the new range, so it will be between 1000 and 2000Hz. On
    the second clk_set_rate_range(), it will consider (rightfully), that our
    current clock is outside of the 3000-4000Hz range, and will call
    clk_core_set_rate_nolock() to set it to 3000Hz.

    clk_core_set_rate_nolock() will then call clk_calc_new_rates() that will
    eventually check that our rate 3000Hz rate is outside the min 3000Hz max
    2000Hz range, will bail out, the error will propagate and we'll
    eventually return -EINVAL.

    This solely relies on the fact that clk_calc_new_rates(), and in
    particular clk_core_determine_round_nolock(), won't modify the new rate
    allowing the error to be reported. That assumption won't be true for all
    drivers, and most importantly we'll break that assumption in a later
    patch.

    It can also be argued that we shouldn't even reach the point where we're
    calling clk_core_set_rate_nolock().

    Let's make an explicit check for disjoints range before we're doing
    anything.

    xen: delay xen_hvm_init_time_ops() if kdump is boot on vcpu>=32

    [ Upstream commit eed05744322da07dd7e419432dcedf3c2e017179 ]

    The sched_clock() can be used very early since commit 857baa87b642
    ("sched/clock: Enable sched clock early"). In addition, with commit
    38669ba205d1 ("x86/xen/time: Output xen sched_clock time from 0"), kdump
    kernel in Xen HVM guest may panic at very early stage when accessing
    &__this_cpu_read(xen_vcpu)->time as in below:

    setup_arch()
     -> init_hypervisor_platform()
         -> x86_init.hyper.init_platform = xen_hvm_guest_init()
             -> xen_hvm_init_time_ops()
                 -> xen_clocksource_read()
                     -> src = &__this_cpu_read(xen_vcpu)->time;

    This is because Xen HVM supports at most MAX_VIRT_CPUS=32 'vcpu_info'
    embedded inside 'shared_info' during early stage until xen_vcpu_setup() is
    used to allocate/relocate 'vcpu_info' for boot cpu at arbitrary address.

    However, when Xen HVM guest panic on vcpu >= 32, since
    xen_vcpu_info_reset(0) would set per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) = NULL when
    vcpu >= 32, xen_clocksource_read() on vcpu >= 32 would panic.

    This patch calls xen_hvm_init_time_ops() again later in
    xen_hvm_smp_prepare_boot_cpu() after the 'vcpu_info' for boot vcpu is
    registered when the boot vcpu is >= 32.

    This issue can be reproduced on purpose via below command at the guest
    side when kdump/kexec is enabled:

    "taskset -c 33 echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger"

    The bugfix for PVM is not implemented due to the lack of testing
    environment.

    cpufreq: CPPC: Fix performance/frequency conversion

    [ Upstream commit ec1c7ad47664f964c1101fe555b6fde0cb124b38 ]

    CPUfreq governors request CPU frequencies using information
    on current CPU usage. The CPPC driver converts them to
    performance requests. Frequency targets are computed as:
            target_freq = (util / cpu_capacity) * max_freq
    target_freq is then clamped between [policy->min, policy->max].

    The CPPC driver converts performance values to frequencies
    (and vice-versa) using cppc_cpufreq_perf_to_khz() and
    cppc_cpufreq_khz_to_perf(). These functions both use two different
    factors depending on the range of the input value. For
    cppc_cpufreq_khz_to_perf():
    - (NOMINAL_PERF / NOMINAL_FREQ) or
    - (LOWEST_PERF / LOWEST_FREQ)
    and for cppc_cpufreq_perf_to_khz():
    - (NOMINAL_FREQ / NOMINAL_PERF) or
    - ((NOMINAL_PERF - LOWEST_FREQ) / (NOMINAL_PERF - LOWEST_PERF))

    This means:
    1- the functions are not inverse for some values:
       (perf_to_khz(khz_to_perf(x)) != x)
    2- cppc_cpufreq_perf_to_khz(LOWEST_PERF) can sometimes give
       a different value from LOWEST_FREQ due to integer approximation
    3- it is implied that performance and frequency are proportional
       (NOMINAL_FREQ / NOMINAL_PERF) == (LOWEST_PERF / LOWEST_FREQ)

    This patch changes the conversion functions to an affine function.
    This fixes the 3 points above.

    clk: rockchip: drop CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT from dclk_vop* on rk3568

    [ Upstream commit ff3187eabb5ce478d15b6ed62eb286756adefac3 ]

    The pixel clocks dclk_vop[012] can be clocked from hpll, vpll, gpll or
    cpll. gpll and cpll also drive many other clocks, so changing the
    dclk_vop[012] clocks could change these other clocks as well. Drop
    CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to fix that. With this change the VOP2 driver can
    only adjust the pixel clocks with the divider between the PLL and the
    dclk_vop[012] which means the user may have to adjust the PLL clock to a
    suitable rate using the assigned-clock-rate device tree property.

    phy: amlogic: meson8b-usb2: fix shared reset control use

    Use reset_control_rearm() call if an error occurs in case
    phy_meson8b_usb2_power_on() fails after reset() has been called, or in
    case phy_meson8b_usb2_power_off() is called i.e the resource is no longer
    used and the reset line may be triggered again by other devices.

    reset_control_rearm() keeps use of triggered_count sane in the reset
    framework, use of reset_control_reset() on shared reset line should
    be balanced with reset_control_rearm().

    minix: fix bug when opening a file with O_DIRECT

    [ Upstream commit 9ce3c0d26c42d279b6c378a03cd6a61d828f19ca ]

    Testcase:
    1. create a minix file system and mount it
    2. open a file on the file system with O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_DIRECT
    3. open fails with -EINVAL but leaves an empty file behind. All other
       open() failures don't leave the failed open files behind.

    It is hard to check the direct_IO op before creating the inode.  Just as
    ext4 and btrfs do, this patch will resolve the issue by allowing to
    create the file with O_DIRECT but returning error when writing the file.

    netfilter: conntrack: revisit gc autotuning

    [ Upstream commit 2cfadb761d3d0219412fd8150faea60c7e863833 ]

    as of commit 4608fdfc07e1
    ("netfilter: conntrack: collect all entries in one cycle")
    conntrack gc was changed to run every 2 minutes.

    On systems where conntrack hash table is set to large value, most evictions
    happen from gc worker rather than the packet path due to hash table
    distribution.

    This causes netlink event overflows when events are collected.

    This change collects average expiry of scanned entries and
    reschedules to the average remaining value, within 1 to 60 second interval.

    To avoid event overflows, reschedule after each bucket and add a
    limit for both run time and number of evictions per run.

    If more entries have to be evicted, reschedule and restart 1 jiffy
    into the future.

    iwlwifi: mei: fix building iwlmei

    [ Upstream commit 066291bec0c55315e568ead501bebdefcb8453d2 ]

    Building iwlmei without CONFIG_CFG80211 causes a link-time warning:

    ld.lld: error: undefined symbol: ieee80211_hdrlen
    >>> referenced by net.c
    >>>               net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mei/net.o:(iwl_mei_tx_copy_to_csme) in archive drivers/built-in.a

    Add an explicit dependency to avoid this. In theory it should not
    be needed here, but it also seems pointless to allow IWLMEI
    for configurations without CFG80211.

    mt76: fix monitor mode crash with sdio driver

    [ Upstream commit 123bc712b1de0805f9d683687e17b1ec2aba0b68 ]

    mt7921s driver may receive frames with fragment buffers. If there is a
    CTS packet received in monitor mode, the payload is 10 bytes only and
    need 6 bytes header padding after RXD buffer. However, only RXD in the
    first linear buffer, if we pull buffer size RXD-size+6 bytes with
    skb_pull(), that would trigger "BUG_ON(skb->len < skb->data_len)" in
    __skb_pull().

    To avoid the nonlinear buffer issue, enlarge the RXD size from 128 to
    256 to make sure all MCU operation in linear buffer.

    net: sfp: add 2500base-X quirk for Lantech SFP module

    The Lantech 8330-262D-E module is 2500base-X capable, but it reports the
    nominal bitrate as 2500MBd instead of 3125MBd. Add a quirk for the
    module.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix 0x05 error code reported by several WMI calls

    [ Upstream commit be9d73e64957bbd31ee9a0d11adc0f720974c558 ]

    Several WMI queries leverage hp_wmi_read_int function to read their
    data. hp_wmi_read_int function was corrected in a previous patch.
    Now, this function invokes hp_wmi_perform_query with input parameter
    of size zero and the output buffer of size 4.

    WMI commands calling hp_wmi_perform_query with input buffer size value
    of zero are listed below.

    HPWMI_DISPLAY_QUERY
    HPWMI_HDDTEMP_QUERY
    HPWMI_ALS_QUERY
    HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY
    HPWMI_WIRELESS_QUERY
    HPWMI_BIOS_QUERY
    HPWMI_FEATURE_QUERY
    HPWMI_HOTKEY_QUERY
    HPWMI_FEATURE2_QUERY
    HPWMI_WIRELESS2_QUERY
    HPWMI_POSTCODEERROR_QUERY
    HPWMI_THERMAL_PROFILE_QUERY
    HPWMI_FAN_SPEED_MAX_GET_QUERY

    Invoking those WMI commands with an input buffer size greater
    than zero will cause error 0x05 to be returned.

    All WMI commands executed by the driver were reviewed and changes
    were made to ensure the expected input and output buffer size match
    the WMI specification.

    Changes were validated on a HP ZBook Workstation notebook,
    HP EliteBook x360, and HP EliteBook 850 G8.  Additional
    validation was included in the test process to ensure no other
    commands were incorrectly handled.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix SW_TABLET_MODE detection method

    [ Upstream commit 520ee4ea1cc60251a6e3c911cf0336278aa52634 ]

    The purpose of this patch is to introduce a fix and removal of the
    current hack when determining tablet mode status.

    Determining the tablet mode status requires reading Byte 0 bit 2 as
    reported by HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY.  The investigation identified the
    failure was rooted in two areas: HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY failure (0x05)
    and reading Byte 0, bit 2 only to determine the table mode status.
    HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY WMI failure also rendered the dock state value
    invalid.

    The latest changes use SMBIOS Type 3 (chassis type) and WMI Command
    0x40 (device_mode_status) information to determine if the device is
    in tablet mode or not.

    hp_wmi_hw_state function was split into two functions;
    hp_wmi_get_dock_state and hp_wmi_get_tablet_mode.  The new functions
    separate how dock_state and tablet_mode is handled in a cleaner
    manner.

    All changes were validated on a HP ZBook Workstation notebook,
    HP EliteBook x360, and HP EliteBook 850 G8.

    net/mlx5e: Remove overzealous validations in netlink EEPROM query

    [ Upstream commit 970adfb76095fa719778d70a6b86030d2feb88dd ]

    Unlike the legacy EEPROM callbacks, when using the netlink EEPROM query
    (get_module_eeprom_by_page) the driver should not try to validate the
    query parameters, but just perform the read requested by the userspace.

    net: limit altnames to 64k total

    Property list (altname is a link "property") is wrapped
    in a nlattr. nlattrs length is 16bit so practically
    speaking the list of properties can't be longer than
    that, otherwise user space would have to interpret
    broken netlink messages.

    Prevent the problem from occurring by checking the length
    of the property list before adding new entries.

    riscv: Fixed misaligned memory access. Fixed pointer comparison.

    [ Upstream commit 9d1f0ec9f71780e69ceb9d91697600c747d6e02e ]

    Rewrote the RISC-V memmove() assembly implementation.  The
    previous implementation did not check memory alignment and it
    compared 2 pointers with a signed comparison.  The misaligned
    memory access would cause the kernel to crash on systems that
    did not emulate it in firmware and did not support it in hardware.
    Firmware emulation is slow and may not exist.  The RISC-V spec
    does not guarantee that support for misaligned memory accesses
    will exist.  It should not be depended on.

    This patch now checks for XLEN granularity of co-alignment between
    the pointers.  Failing that, copying is done by loading from the 2
    contiguous and naturally aligned XLEN memory locations containing
    the overlapping XLEN sized data to be copied.  The data is shifted
    into the correct place and binary or'ed together on each
    iteration.  The result is then stored into the corresponding
    naturally aligned XLEN sized location in the destination.  For
    unaligned data at the terminations of the regions to be copied
    or for copies less than (2 * XLEN) in size, byte copy is used.

    This patch also now uses unsigned comparison for the pointers and
    migrates to the newer assembler annotations from the now deprecated
    ones.

    can: etas_es58x: es58x_fd_rx_event_msg(): initialize rx_event_msg before calling es58x_check_msg_len()

    [ Upstream commit 7a8cd7c0ee823a1cc893ab3feaa23e4b602bfb9a ]

    Function es58x_fd_rx_event() invokes the es58x_check_msg_len() macro:

    |       ret = es58x_check_msg_len(es58x_dev->dev, *rx_event_msg, msg_len);

    While doing so, it dereferences an uninitialized
    variable: *rx_event_msg.

    This is actually harmless because es58x_check_msg_len() only uses
    preprocessor macros (sizeof() and __stringify()) on
    *rx_event_msg. c.f. [1].

    Nonetheless, this pattern is confusing so the lines are reordered to
    make sure that rx_event_msg is correctly initialized.

    This patch also fixes a false positive warning reported by cppcheck:

    can: isotp: set default value for N_As to 50 micro seconds

    [ Upstream commit 530e0d46c61314c59ecfdb8d3bcb87edbc0f85d3 ]

    The N_As value describes the time a CAN frame needs on the wire when
    transmitted by the CAN controller. Even very short CAN FD frames need
    arround 100 usecs (bitrate 1Mbit/s, data bitrate 8Mbit/s).

    Having N_As to be zero (the former default) leads to 'no CAN frame
    separation' when STmin is set to zero by the receiving node. This 'burst
    mode' should not be enabled by default as it could potentially dump a high
    number of CAN frames into the netdev queue from the soft hrtimer context.
    This does not affect the system stability but is just not nice and
    cooperative.

    With this N_As/frame_txtime value the 'burst mode' is disabled by default.

    As user space applications usually do not set the frame_txtime element
    of struct can_isotp_options the new in-kernel default is very likely
    overwritten with zero when the sockopt() CAN_ISOTP_OPTS is invoked.
    To make sure that a N_As value of zero is only set intentional the
    value '0' is now interpreted as 'do not change the current value'.
    When a frame_txtime of zero is required for testing purposes this
    CAN_ISOTP_FRAME_TXTIME_ZERO u32 value has to be set in frame_txtime.

    powerpc/64e: Tie PPC_BOOK3E_64 to PPC_FSL_BOOK3E

    [ Upstream commit 1a76e520ee1831a81dabf8a9a58c6453f700026e ]

    Since the IBM A2 CPU support was removed, see commit
    fb5a515704d7 ("powerpc: Remove platforms/wsp and associated pieces"),
    the only 64-bit Book3E CPUs we support are Freescale (NXP) ones.

    However our Kconfig still allows configurating a kernel that has 64-bit
    Book3E support, but no Freescale CPU support enabled. Such a kernel
    would never boot, it doesn't know about any CPUs.

    It also causes build errors, as reported by lkp, because
    PPC_BARRIER_NOSPEC is not enabled in such a configuration:

      powerpc64-linux-ld: arch/powerpc/net/bpf_jit_comp64.o:(.toc+0x0):
      undefined reference to `powerpc_security_features'

    To fix this, force PPC_FSL_BOOK3E to be selected whenever we are
    building a 64-bit Book3E kernel.

    Peter pointed out that this is because do_patch_instruction() has
    disabled interrupts, but then map_patch_area() calls map_kernel_page()
    then hash__map_kernel_page() which does a sleeping memory allocation.

    We only see the warning in KVM guests with SMT enabled, which is not
    particularly common, or on other platforms if CONFIG_KPROBES is
    disabled, also not common. The reason we don't see it in most
    configurations is that another path that happens to have interrupts
    enabled has allocated the required page tables for us, eg. there's a
    path in kprobes init that does that. That's just pure luck though.

    As Christophe suggested, the simplest solution is to do a dummy
    map/unmap when we initialise the patching, so that any required page
    table levels are pre-allocated before the first call to
    do_patch_instruction(). This works because the unmap doesn't free any
    page tables that were allocated by the map, it just clears the PTE,
    leaving the page table levels there for the next map.

    MIPS: fix fortify panic when copying asm exception handlers

    [ Upstream commit d17b66417308996e7e64b270a3c7f3c1fbd4cfc8 ]

    With KCFLAGS="-O3", I was able to trigger a fortify-source
    memcpy() overflow panic on set_vi_srs_handler().
    Although O3 level is not supported in the mainline, under some
    conditions that may've happened with any optimization settings,
    it's just a matter of inlining luck. The panic itself is correct,
    more precisely, 50/50 false-positive and not at the same time.
    From the one side, no real overflow happens. Exception handler
    defined in asm just gets copied to some reserved places in the
    memory.
    But the reason behind is that C code refers to that exception
    handler declares it as `char`, i.e. something of 1 byte length.
    It's obvious that the asm function itself is way more than 1 byte,
    so fortify logics thought we are going to past the symbol declared.
    The standard way to refer to asm symbols from C code which is not
    supposed to be called from C is to declare them as
    `extern const u8[]`. This is fully correct from any point of view,
    as any code itself is just a bunch of bytes (including 0 as it is
    for syms like _stext/_etext/etc.), and the exact size is not known
    at the moment of compilation.
    Adjust the type of the except_vec_vi_*() and related variables.
    Make set_handler() take `const` as a second argument to avoid
    cast-away warnings and give a little more room for optimization.

    bnxt_en: Eliminate unintended link toggle during FW reset

    [ Upstream commit 7c492a2530c1f05441da541307c2534230dfd59b ]

    If the flow control settings have been changed, a subsequent FW reset
    may cause the ethernet link to toggle unnecessarily.  This link toggle
    will increase the down time by a few seconds.

    The problem is caused by bnxt_update_phy_setting() detecting a false
    mismatch in the flow control settings between the stored software
    settings and the current FW settings after the FW reset.  This mismatch
    is caused by the AUTONEG bit added to link_info->req_flow_ctrl in an
    inconsistent way in bnxt_set_pauseparam() in autoneg mode.  The AUTONEG
    bit should not be added to link_info->req_flow_ctrl.

    Bluetooth: mediatek: fix the conflict between mtk and msft vendor event

    [ Upstream commit e4412654e260842e1a94ffe0d4026e8a6fd34246 ]

    There is a conflict between MediaTek wmt event and msft vendor extension
    logic in the core layer since 145373cb1b1f ("Bluetooth: Add framework for
    Microsoft vendor extension") was introduced because we changed the type of
    mediatek wmt event to the type of msft vendor event in the driver.

    But the purpose we reported mediatek event to the core layer is for the
    diagnostic purpose with that we are able to see the full packet trace via
    monitoring socket with btmon. Thus, it is harmless we keep the original
    type of mediatek vendor event here to avoid breaking the msft extension
    function especially they can be supported by Mediatek chipset like MT7921
    , MT7922 devices and future devices.

    platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add dual fan probe

    [ Upstream commit bf779aaf56ea23864e39e9862b3b3a8436236e07 ]

    Instead of having quirks for systems that have a second fan it would
    be nice to detect this setup.
    Unfortunately, confirmed by the Lenovo FW team, there is no way to
    retrieve this information from the EC or BIOS. Recommendation was to
    attempt to read the fan and if successful then assume a 2nd fan is
    present.

    The fans are also supposed to spin up on boot for some time, so in
    theory we could check for a speed > 0. In testing this seems to hold
    true but as I couldn't test on all platforms I've avoided implementing
    this. It also breaks for the corner case where you load the module
    once the fans are idle.

    Tested on P1G4, P1G3, X1C9 and T14 (no fans) and it works correctly.
    For the platforms with dual fans where it was confirmed to work I have
    removed the quirks. Potentially this could be done for all platforms
    but I've left untested platforms in for now. On these platforms the
    fans will be enabled and then detected - so no impact.

    iavf: stop leaking iavf_status as "errno" values

    [ Upstream commit bae569d01a1f4929ce28093be80bbbbacbf1b127 ]

    Several functions in the iAVF core files take status values of the enum
    iavf_status and convert them into integer values. This leads to
    confusion as functions return both Linux errno values and status codes
    intermixed. Reporting status codes as if they were "errno" values can
    lead to confusion when reviewing error logs. Additionally, it can lead
    to unexpected behavior if a return value is not interpreted properly.

    Fix this by introducing iavf_status_to_errno, a switch that explicitly
    converts from the status codes into an appropriate error value. Also
    introduce a virtchnl_status_to_errno function for the one case where we
    were returning both virtchnl status codes and iavf_status codes in the
    same function.

    net/smc: correct settings of RMB window update limit

    [ Upstream commit 6bf536eb5c8ca011d1ff57b5c5f7c57ceac06a37 ]

    rmbe_update_limit is used to limit announcing receive
    window updating too frequently. RFC7609 request a minimal
    increase in the window size of 10% of the receive buffer
    space. But current implementation used:

      min_t(int, rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2)

    and SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2 == 2304 Bytes, which is almost
    always less then 10% of the receive buffer space.

    This causes the receiver always sending CDC message to
    update its consumer cursor when it consumes more then 2K
    of data. And as a result, we may encounter something like
    "TCP silly window syndrome" when sending 2.5~8K message.

    This patch fixes this using max(rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2).

    With this patch and SMC autocorking enabled, qperf 2K/4K/8K
    tcp_bw test shows 45%/75%/40% increase in throughput respectively.

    powerpc/64s/hash: Make hash faults work in NMI context

    [ Upstream commit 8b91cee5eadd2021f55e6775f2d50bd56d00c217 ]

    Hash faults are not resoved in NMI context, instead causing the access
    to fail. This is done because perf interrupts can get backtraces
    including walking the user stack, and taking a hash fault on those could
    deadlock on the HPTE lock if the perf interrupt hits while the same HPTE
    lock is being held by the hash fault code. The user-access for the stack
    walking will notice the access failed and deal with that in the perf
    code.

    The reason to allow perf interrupts in is to better profile hash faults.

    The problem with this is any hash fault on a kernel access that happens
    in NMI context will crash, because kernel accesses must not fail.

    Hard lockups, system reset, machine checks that access vmalloc space
    including modules and including stack backtracing and symbol lookup in
    modules, per-cpu data, etc could all run into this problem.

    Fix this by disallowing perf interrupts in the hash fault code (the
    direct hash fault is covered by MSR[EE]=0 so the PMI disable just needs
    to extend to the preload case). This simplifies the tricky logic in hash
    faults and perf, at the cost of reduced profiling of hash faults.

    perf can still latch addresses when interrupts are disabled, it just
    won't get the stack trace at that point, so it would still find hot
    spots, just sometimes with confusing stack chains.

    An alternative could be to allow perf interrupts here but always do the
    slowpath stack walk if we are in nmi context, but that slows down all
    perf interrupt stack walking on hash though and it does not remove as
    much tricky code.

    mctp: make __mctp_dev_get() take a refcount hold

    [ Upstream commit dc121c0084910db985cf1c8ba6fce5d8c307cc02 ]

    Previously there was a race that could allow the mctp_dev refcount
    to hit zero:

    rcu_read_lock();
    mdev = __mctp_dev_get(dev);
    // mctp_unregister() happens here, mdev->refs hits zero
    mctp_dev_hold(dev);
    rcu_read_unlock();

    Now we make __mctp_dev_get() take the hold itself. It is safe to test
    against the zero refcount because __mctp_dev_get() is called holding
    rcu_read_lock and mctp_dev uses kfree_rcu().

    mt76: mt7915: fix injected MPDU transmission to not use HW A-MSDU

    [ Upstream commit 28225a6ef80ebf46c46e5fbd5b1ee231a0b2b5b7 ]

    Before, the hardware would be allowed to transmit injected 802.11 MPDUs
    as A-MSDU. This resulted in corrupted frames being transmitted. Now,
    injected MPDUs are transmitted as-is, without A-MSDU.

    The fix was verified with frame injection on MT7915 hardware, both with
    and without the injected frame being encrypted.

    If the hardware cannot do A-MSDU aggregation on MPDUs, this problem
    would also be present in the TX path where mac80211 does the 802.11
    encapsulation. However, I have not observed any such problem when
    disabling IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_ENCAP_OFFLOAD to force that mode.
    Therefore this fix is isolated to injected frames only.

    The same A-MSDU logic is also present in the mt7921 driver, so it is
    likely that this fix should be applied there too. I do not have access
    to mt7921 hardware so I have not been able to test that.

    scsi: pm8001: Fix tag values handling

    [ Upstream commit 7fb23a785ba38dea907323a039123f231195b297 ]

    The function pm8001_tag_alloc() determines free tags using the function
    find_first_zero_bit() which can return 0 when the first bit of the bitmap
    being inspected is 0. As such, tag 0 is a valid tag value that should not
    be dismissed as invalid. Fix the functions pm8001_work_fn(),
    mpi_sata_completion(), pm8001_mpi_task_abort_resp() and
    pm8001_open_reject_retry() to not dismiss 0 tags as invalid.

    The value 0xffffffff is used for invalid tags for unused ccb information
    structures. Add the macro definition PM8001_INVALID_TAG to define this
    value.

    [ Upstream commit 3762d8f6edcdb03994c919f9487fd6d336c06561 ]

    The declaration of the local variable destination1 in pm80xx_pci_mem_copy()
    as a pointer to a u32 results in the sparse warning:

    warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
        expected unsigned int [usertype]
        got restricted __le32 [usertype]

    Furthermore, the destination" argument of pm80xx_pci_mem_copy() is wrongly
    declared with the const attribute.

    Fix both problems by changing the type of the "destination" argument to
    "__le32 *" and use this argument directly inside the pm80xx_pci_mem_copy()
    function, thus removing the need for the destination1 local variable.

    This race of IO being submitted before the DM device ready is so
    narrow, yet possible for initial table load given that the DM device's

    ipv4: Invalidate neighbour for broadcast address upon address addition

    [ Upstream commit 0c51e12e218f20b7d976158fdc18019627326f7a ]

    In case user space sends a packet destined to a broadcast address when a
    matching broadcast route is not configured, the kernel will create a
    unicast neighbour entry that will never be resolved [1].

    When the broadcast route is configured, the unicast neighbour entry will
    not be invalidated and continue to linger, resulting in packets being
    dropped.

    Solve this by invalidating unresolved neighbour entries for broadcast
    addresses after routes for these addresses are internally configured by
    the kernel. This allows the kernel to create a broadcast neighbour entry
    following the next route lookup.

    Another possible solution that is more generic but also more complex is
    to have the ARP code register a listener to the FIB notification chain
    and invalidate matching neighbour entries upon the addition of broadcast
    routes.

    It is also possible to wave off the issue as a user space problem, but
    it seems a bit excessive to expect user space to be that intimately
    familiar with the inner workings of the FIB/neighbour kernel code.

    ath11k: Fix frames flush failure caused by deadlock

    [ Upstream commit 261b07519518bd14cb168b287b17e1d195f8d0c8 ]

    We are seeing below warnings:

    this means ath11k fails to flush mgmt. frames because wmi_mgmt_tx_work

    ath11k_mac_op_flush where it waits all mgmt. frames to be sent out by
    wmi_mgmt_tx_work. Meanwhile, sdata->work is blocked by wdev->mtx in
    ieee80211_sta_work, as a result wmi_mgmt_tx_work has no chance to run.

    Change to use ab->workqueue instead of local->workqueue to fix this issue.

    x86/mce: Work around an erratum on fast string copy instructions

    [ Upstream commit 8ca97812c3c830573f965a07bbd84223e8c5f5bd ]

    A rare kernel panic scenario can happen when the following conditions
    are met due to an erratum on fast string copy instructions:

    1) An uncorrected error.
    2) That error must be in first cache line of a page.
    3) Kernel must execute page_copy from the page immediately before that
    page.

    The fast string copy instructions ("REP; MOVS*") could consume an
    uncorrectable memory error in the cache line _right after_ the desired
    region to copy and raise an MCE.

    Bit 0 of MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE can be cleared to disable fast string
    copy and will avoid such spurious machine checks. However, that is less
    preferable due to the permanent performance impact. Considering memory
    poison is rare, it's desirable to keep fast string copy enabled until an
    MCE is seen.

    Intel has confirmed the following:
    1. The CPU erratum of fast string copy only applies to Skylake,
    Cascade Lake and Cooper Lake generations.

    Directly return from the MCE handler:
    2. Will result in complete execution of the "REP; MOVS*" with no data
    loss or corruption.
    3. Will not result in another MCE firing on the next poisoned cache line
    due to "REP; MOVS*".
    4. Will resume execution from a correct point in code.
    5. Will result in the same instruction that triggered the MCE firing a
    second MCE immediately for any other software recoverable data fetch
    errors.
    6. Is not safe without disabling the fast string copy, as the next fast
    string copy of the same buffer on the same CPU would result in a PANIC
    MCE.

    This should mitigate the erratum completely with the only caveat that
    the fast string copy is disabled on the affected hyper thread thus
    performance degradation.

    This is still better than the OS crashing on MCEs raised on an
    irrelevant process due to "REP; MOVS*' accesses in a kernel context,
    e.g., copy_page.

    Tested:

    Injected errors on 1st cache line of 8 anonymous pages of process
    'proc1' and observed MCE consumption from 'proc2' with no panic
    (directly returned).

    Without the fix, the host panicked within a few minutes on a
    random 'proc2' process due to kernel access from copy_page.

    drm/msm/dsi: Remove spurious IRQF_ONESHOT flag

    [ Upstream commit 24b176d8827d167ac3b379317f60c0985f6e95aa ]

    Quoting the header comments, IRQF_ONESHOT is "Used by threaded interrupts
    which need to keep the irq line disabled until the threaded handler has
    been run.". When applied to an interrupt that doesn't request a threaded
    irq then IRQF_ONESHOT has a lesser known (undocumented?) side effect,
    which it to disable the forced threading of irqs (and for "normal" kernels
    it is a nop). In this case I can find no evidence that suppressing forced
    threading is intentional. Had it been intentional then a driver must adopt
    the raw_spinlock API in order to avoid deadlocks on PREEMPT_RT kernels
    (and avoid calling any kernel API that uses regular spinlocks).

    Fix this by removing the spurious additional flag.

    This change is required for my Snapdragon 7cx Gen2 tablet to boot-to-GUI
    with PREEMPT_RT enabled.

    ipv6: annotate some data-races around sk->sk_prot

    [ Upstream commit 086d49058cd8471046ae9927524708820f5fd1c7 ]

    IPv6 has this hack changing sk->sk_prot when an IPv6 socket
    is 'converted' to an IPv4 one with IPV6_ADDRFORM option.

    This operation is only performed for TCP and UDP, knowing
    their 'struct proto' for the two network families are populated
    in the same way, and can not disappear while a reader
    might use and dereference sk->sk_prot.

    If we think about it all reads of sk->sk_prot while
    either socket lock or RTNL is not acquired should be using READ_ONCE().

    Also note that other layers like MPTCP, XFRM, CHELSIO_TLS also
    write over sk->sk_prot.

    iwlwifi: mvm: Correctly set fragmented EBS

    [ Upstream commit d8d4dd26b9e0469baf5017f0544d852fd4e3fb6d ]

    Currently, fragmented EBS was set for a channel only if the 'hb_type'
    was set to fragmented or balanced scan. However, 'hb_type' is set only
    in case of CDB, and thus fragmented EBS is never set for a channel for
    non-CDB devices. Fix it.

    drm/amd/display: reset lane settings after each PHY repeater LT

    [ Upstream commit 3b853c316c9321e195414a6fb121d1c2d45b1e87 ]

    [why]
    In LTTPR non-transparent mode, we need
    to reset the cached lane settings before performing
    link training on the next PHY repeater. Otherwise,
    the cached lane settings will be used for the next
    clock recovery e.g. VS = MAX (3) which should not be
    the case according to the DP specs. We expect to use
    minimum lane settings on each clock recovery sequence.

    [how]
    Reset DPCD and HW lane settings on each repeater LT.
    Set training pattern to 0 for the repeater that failed LT
    at the proper place.

    power: supply: axp288-charger: Set Vhold to 4.4V

    [ Upstream commit 5ac121b81b4051e7fc83d5b3456a5e499d5bd147 ]

    The AXP288's recommended and factory default Vhold value (minimum
    input voltage below which the input current draw will be reduced)
    is 4.4V. This lines up with other charger IC's such as the TI
    bq2419x/bq2429x series which use 4.36V or 4.44V.

    For some reason some BIOS-es initialize Vhold to 4.6V or even 4.7V
    which combined with the typical voltage drop over typically low
    wire gauge micro-USB cables leads to the input-current getting
    capped below 1A (with a 2A capable dedicated charger) based on Vhold.

    This leads to slow charging, or even to the device slowly discharging
    if the device is in heavy use.

    As the Linux AXP288 drivers use the builtin BC1.2 charger detection
    and send the input-current-limit according to the detected charger
    there really is no reason not to use the recommended 4.4V Vhold.

    Set Vhold to 4.4V to fix the slow charging issue on various devices.

    There is one exception, the special-case of the HP X2 2-in-1s which
    combine this BC1.2 capable PMIC with a Type-C port and a 5V/3A factory
    provided charger with a Type-C plug which does not do BC1.2. These
    have their input-current-limit hardcoded to 3A (like under Windows)
    and use a higher Vhold on purpose to limit the current when used
    with other chargers. To avoid touching Vhold on these HP X2 laptops
    the code setting Vhold is added to an else branch of the if checking
    for these models.

    Note this also fixes the sofar unused VBUS_ISPOUT_VHOLD_SET_MASK
    define, which was wrong.

    Remove the read / modify / write sequence to make the operation atomic
    and remove the spin_lock() in change_page_attr().

    To do the operation atomically, we can't use pte modification helpers
    anymore. Because all platforms have different combination of bits, it
    is not easy to use those bits directly. But all have the
    _PAGE_KERNEL_{RO/ROX/RW/RWX} set of flags. All we need it to compare
    two sets to know which bits are set or cleared.

    For instance, by comparing _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX and _PAGE_KERNEL_RO you
    know which bit gets cleared and which bit get set when changing exec
    permission.

    tcp: Don't acquire inet_listen_hashbucket::lock with disabled BH.

    [ Upstream commit 4f9bf2a2f5aacf988e6d5e56b961ba45c5a25248 ]

    Commit
       9652dc2eb9e40 ("tcp: relax listening_hash operations")

    removed the need to disable bottom half while acquiring
    listening_hash.lock. There are still two callers left which disable
    bottom half before the lock is acquired.

    On PREEMPT_RT the softirqs are preemptible and local_bh_disable() acts
    as a lock to ensure that resources, that are protected by disabling
    bottom halves, remain protected.
    This leads to a circular locking dependency if the lock acquired with
    disabled bottom halves is also acquired with enabled bottom halves
    followed by disabling bottom halves. This is the reverse locking order.
    It has been observed with inet_listen_hashbucket::lock:

    local_bh_disable() + spin_lock(&ilb->lock):
      inet_listen()
        inet_csk_listen_start()
          sk->sk_prot->hash() := inet_hash()
            local_bh_disable()
            __inet_hash()
              spin_lock(&ilb->lock);
                acquire(&ilb->lock);

    Reverse order: spin_lock(&ilb2->lock) + local_bh_disable():
      tcp_seq_next()
        listening_get_next()
          spin_lock(&ilb2->lock);
            acquire(&ilb2->lock);

      tcp4_seq_show()
        get_tcp4_sock()
          sock_i_ino()
            read_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
              acquire(softirq_ctrl) // <---- whoops
              acquire(&sk->sk_callback_lock)

    Drop local_bh_disable() around __inet_hash() which acquires
    listening_hash->lock. Split inet_unhash() and acquire the
    listen_hashbucket lock without disabling bottom halves; the inet_ehash

    PCI: endpoint: Fix alignment fault error in copy tests

    [ Upstream commit 829cc0e2ea2d61fb6c54bc3f8a17f86c56e11864 ]

    The copy test uses the memcpy() to copy data between IO memory spaces.
    This can trigger an alignment fault error (pasted the error logs below)
    because memcpy() may use unaligned accesses on a mapped memory that is
    just IO, which does not support unaligned memory accesses.

    Fix it by using the correct memcpy API to copy from/to IO memory.

    KVM: arm64: Do not change the PMU event filter after a VCPU has run

    [ Upstream commit 5177fe91e4cf78a659aada2c9cf712db4d788481 ]

    Userspace can specify which events a guest is allowed to use with the
    KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_FILTER attribute. The list of allowed events can be
    identified by a guest from reading the PMCEID{0,1}_EL0 registers.

    Changing the PMU event filter after a VCPU has run can cause reads of the
    registers performed before the filter is changed to return different values
    than reads performed with the new event filter in place. The architecture
    defines the two registers as read-only, and this behaviour contradicts
    that.

    Keep track when the first VCPU has run and deny changes to the PMU event
    filter to prevent this from happening.

    kvm_set_gsi_routing_irqchip_check(expect_failure=true) is used to check
    the error code returned by the kernel when trying to setup an invalid
    gsi routing table. The ioctl fails if "pin >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS", so
    kvm_set_gsi_routing_irqchip_check() should test the error only when
    "intid >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS+32". The issue is that the test check is
    "intid >= KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS", so for a case like "intid =
    KVM_IRQCHIP_NUM_PINS" the test wrongly assumes that the kernel will
    return an error.  Fix this by using the right check.

    The guest in vgic_irq gets its arguments in a struct. This struct used

    after some commits and some guest args became random (specically

    PCI: aardvark: Fix support for MSI interrupts

    [ Upstream commit b0b0b8b897f8e12b2368e868bd7cdc5742d5c5a9 ]

    Aardvark hardware supports Multi-MSI and MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI is already
    set for the MSI chip. But when allocating MSI interrupt numbers for
    Multi-MSI, the numbers need to be properly aligned, otherwise endpoint
    devices send MSI interrupt with incorrect numbers.

    Fix this issue by using function bitmap_find_free_region() instead of
    bitmap_find_next_zero_area().

    To ensure that aligned MSI interrupt numbers are used by endpoint devices,
    we cannot use Linux virtual irq numbers (as they are random and not
    properly aligned). Instead we need to use the aligned hwirq numbers.

    This change fixes receiving MSI interrupts on Armada 3720 boards and
    allows using NVMe disks which use Multi-MSI feature with 3 interrupts.

    Without this NVMe disks freeze booting as linux nvme-core.c is waiting
    60s for an interrupt.

    [ Upstream commit 3ada501d602abf02353445c03bb3258146445d90 ]

    Avoid dropping into shell if the controller is in locked up state.

    Driver issues SIS soft reset to bring back the controller to SIS mode while
    OS boots into kdump mode.

    If the controller is in lockup state, SIS soft reset does not work.

    Since the controller lockup code has not been cleared, driver considers the
    firmware is no longer up and running. Driver returns back an error code to
    OS and the kdump fails.

    powerpc: Set crashkernel offset to mid of RMA region

    [ Upstream commit 7c5ed82b800d8615cdda00729e7b62e5899f0b13 ]

    On large config LPARs (having 192 and more cores), Linux fails to boot
    due to insufficient memory in the first memblock. It is due to the
    memory reservation for the crash kernel which starts at 128MB offset of
    the first memblock. This memory reservation for the crash kernel doesn't
    leave enough space in the first memblock to accommodate other essential
    system resources.

    The crash kernel start address was set to 128MB offset by default to
    ensure that the crash kernel get some memory below the RMA region which
    is used to be of size 256MB. But given that the RMA region size can be
    512MB or more, setting the crash kernel offset to mid of RMA size will
    leave enough space for the kernel to allocate memory for other system
    resources.

    Since the above crash kernel offset change is only applicable to the LPAR
    platform, the LPAR feature detection is pushed before the crash kernel
    reservation. The rest of LPAR specific initialization will still
    be done during pseries_probe_fw_features as usual.

    This patch is dependent on changes to paca allocation for boot CPU. It
    expect boot CPU to discover 1T segment support which is introduced by
    the patch posted here:

    net: initialize init_net earlier

    [ Upstream commit 9c1be1935fb68b2413796cdc03d019b8cf35ab51 ]

    While testing a patch that will follow later
    ("net: add netns refcount tracker to struct nsproxy")
    I found that devtmpfs_init() was called before init_net
    was initialized.

    This is a bug, because devtmpfs_setup() calls
    ksys_unshare(CLONE_NEWNS);

    This has the effect of increasing init_net refcount,
    which will be later overwritten to 1, as part of setup_net(&init_net)

    We had too many prior patches [1] trying to work around the root cause.

    Really, make sure init_net is in BSS section, and that net_ns_init()
    is called earlier at boot time.

    Note that another patch ("vfs: add netns refcount tracker
    to struct fs_context") also will need net_ns_init() being called
    before vfs_caches_init()

    As a bonus, this patch saves around 4KB in .data section.

    libbpf: Fix build issue with llvm-readelf

    [ Upstream commit 0908a66ad1124c1634c33847ac662106f7f2c198 ]

    There are cases where clang compiler is packaged in a way
    readelf is a symbolic link to llvm-readelf. In such cases,
    llvm-readelf will be used instead of default binutils readelf,
    and the following error will appear during libbpf build:

    #  Warning: Num of global symbols in

    The above failure is due to different printouts for some ABS
    versioned symbols. For example, with the same libbpf.so,
      $ /bin/readelf --dyn-syms --wide tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.so | grep "LIBBPF" | grep ABS
         134: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS LIBBPF_0.5.0
         202: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS LIBBPF_0.6.0
         ...
      $ /opt/llvm/bin/readelf --dyn-syms --wide tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.so | grep "LIBBPF" | grep ABS
         134: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   ABS LIBBPF_0.5.0@@LIBBPF_0.5.0
         202: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   ABS LIBBPF_0.6.0@@LIBBPF_0.6.0
         ...
    The binutils readelf doesn't print out the symbol LIBBPF_* version and llvm-readelf does.
    Such a difference caused libbpf build failure with llvm-readelf.

    The proposed fix filters out all ABS symbols as they are not part of the comparison.
    This works for both binutils readelf and llvm-readelf.

    mt76: dma: initialize skip_unmap in mt76_dma_rx_fill

    [ Upstream commit 577298ec55dfc8b9aece54520f0258c3f93a6573 ]

    used in mt76_dma_tx_cleanup_idx routine, initialize skip_unmap in
    mt76_dma_rx_fill in order to fix the following UBSAN report:

    mt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.

    [ Upstream commit 827e7799c61b978fbc2cc9dac66cb62401b2b3f0 ]

    If the nic fails to start, it is possible that the
    reset_work has already been scheduled.  Ensure the
    work item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free
    crash in case cleanup is called before the work item
    is executed.

    This fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio
    fails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not
    crash.

    power: supply: axp20x_battery: properly report current when discharging

    [ Upstream commit d4f408cdcd26921c1268cb8dcbe8ffb6faf837f3 ]

    As stated in [1], negative current values are used for discharging
    batteries.

    AXP PMICs internally have two different ADC channels for shunt current
    measurement: one used during charging and one during discharging.
    The values reported by these ADCs are unsigned.
    While the driver properly selects ADC channel to get the data from,
    it doesn't apply negative sign when reporting discharging current.

    drm/v3d: fix missing unlock

    [ Upstream commit e57c1a3bd5e8e0c7181f65ae55581f0236a8f284 ]

    [why]
    Unlock is needed on the error handling path to prevent dead lock.
    v3d_submit_cl_ioctl and v3d_submit_csd_ioctl is missing unlock.

    [how]
    Fix this by changing goto target on the error handling path. So
    changing the goto to target an error handling path
    that includes drm_gem_unlock reservations.

    bpf: Make dst_port field in struct bpf_sock 16-bit wide

    [ Upstream commit 4421a582718ab81608d8486734c18083b822390d ]

    Menglong Dong reports that the documentation for the dst_port field in
    struct bpf_sock is inaccurate and confusing. From the BPF program PoV, the
    field is a zero-padded 16-bit integer in network byte order. The value
    appears to the BPF user as if laid out in memory as so:

      offsetof(struct bpf_sock, dst_port) + 0  <port MSB>
                                          + 8  <port LSB>
                                          +16  0x00
                                          +24  0x00

    32-, 16-, and 8-bit wide loads from the field are all allowed, but only if
    the offset into the field is 0.

    32-bit wide loads from dst_port are especially confusing. The loaded value,
    after converting to host byte order with bpf_ntohl(dst_port), contains the
    port number in the upper 16-bits.

    Remove the confusion by splitting the field into two 16-bit fields. For
    backward compatibility, allow 32-bit wide loads from offsetof(struct
    bpf_sock, dst_port).

    While at it, allow loads 8-bit loads at offset [0] and [1] from dst_port.

    drm/bridge: Add missing pm_runtime_put_sync

    [ Upstream commit 46f47807738441e354873546dde0b000106c068a ]

    pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the rumtime PM counter
    even when it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed
    to prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with
    pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime
    PM counter on error. Besides, a matching decrement is needed
    on the error handling path to keep the counter balanced.

    net/smc: Send directly when TCP_CORK is cleared

    [ Upstream commit ea785a1a573b390a150010b3c5b81e1ccd8c98a8 ]

    According to the man page of TCP_CORK [1], if set, don't send out
    partial frames. All queued partial frames are sent when option is
    cleared again.

    When applications call setsockopt to disable TCP_CORK, this call is
    protected by lock_sock(), and tries to mod_delayed_work() to 0, in order
    to send pending data right now. However, the delayed work smc_tx_work is
    also protected by lock_sock(). There introduces lock contention for
    sending data.

    To fix it, send pending data directly which acts like TCP, without
    lock_sock() protected in the context of setsockopt (already lock_sock()ed),
    and cancel unnecessary dealyed work, which is protected by lock.

    ath11k: mhi: use mhi_sync_power_up()

    [ Upstream commit 3df6d74aedfdca919cca475d15dfdbc8b05c9e5d ]

    If amss.bin was missing ath11k would crash during 'rmmod ath11k_pci'. The
    reason for that was that we were using mhi_async_power_up() which does not
    check any errors. But mhi_sync_power_up() on the other hand does check for
    errors so let's use that to fix the crash.

    I was not able to find a reason why an async version was used.
    ath11k_mhi_start() (which enables state ATH11K_MHI_POWER_ON) is called from
    ath11k_hif_power_up(), which can sleep. So sync version should be safe to use
    here.

    The issue here is that board file loading happens after ath11k_pci_probe()
    succesfully returns (ath11k initialisation happends asynchronously) and the
    suspend handler is still enabled, of course failing as ath11k is not properly
    initialised. Fix this by checking ATH11K_FLAG_QMI_FAIL during both suspend and
    resume.

    We can't do instant reconnect, not to DDoS server, but we should stop and
    failover earlier, so there is less service interruption.

    To avoid deadlock, as error_recovery is called from different callback
    like rdma event or hb error handler, add a new err recovery_work.

    mlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports

    [ Upstream commit bcdfd615f83b4bd04678109bf18022d1476e4bbf ]

    When processing events generated by the device's firmware, the driver
    protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but
    not for the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all
    the fields as any local port.

    This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access
    'struct mlxsw_sp_port' fields which are not initialized for CPU port.

    Commit 63b08b1f6834 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware")
    already handled such issue by bailing early when processing a PUDE event
    reported for the CPU port.

    Generalize the approach by moving the check to a common function and
    making use of it in all relevant places.

    net/mlx5e: TC, Hold sample_attr on stack instead of pointer

    [ Upstream commit eeed226ed110ed40598e60e29b66643012277be7 ]

    In later commit we are going to instantiate multiple attr instances
    for flow instead of single attr.
    Parsing TC sample allocates a new memory but there is no symmetric
    cleanup in the infrastructure.
    To avoid asymmetric alloc/free use sample_attr as part of the flow attr
    and not allocated and held as a pointer.
    This will avoid a cleanup leak when sample action is not on the first
    attr.

    selftests, xsk: Fix bpf_res cleanup test

    [ Upstream commit 3b22523bca02b0d5618c08b93d8fd1fb578e1cc3 ]

    After commit 710ad98c363a ("veth: Do not record rx queue hint in veth_xmit"),
    veth no longer receives traffic on the same queue as it was sent on. This
    breaks the bpf_res test for the AF_XDP selftests as the socket tied to
    queue 1 will not receive traffic anymore.

    Modify the test so that two sockets are tied to queue id 0 using a shared
    umem instead. When killing the first socket enter the second socket into
    the xskmap so that traffic will flow to it. This will still test that the
    resources are not cleaned up until after the second socket dies, without
    having to rely on veth supporting rx_queue hints.

    drm/amd/display: Use PSR version selected during set_psr_caps

    [ Upstream commit b80ddeb29d9df449f875f0b6f5de08d7537c02b8 ]

    [Why]
    If the DPCD caps specifies a PSR version newer than PSR_VERSION_1 then
    we fallback to using PSR_VERSION_1 in amdgpu_dm_set_psr_caps.

    This gets overriden with the raw DPCD value in amdgpu_dm_link_setup_psr,
    which can result in DMCUB hanging if we pass in an unsupported PSR
    version number.

    [How]
    Fix the hang by using link->psr_settings.psr_version directly during
    amdgpu_dm_link_setup_psr.

    This issue takes place in an error path in

    default case, the function simply returns -EINVAL, forgetting to
    decrement the reference count of a dma_fence obj, which is bumped

    leaks.

    Fix it by decreasing the refcount of specific object before returning

    When one of the three connection complete events is received multiple
    times for the same handle, the device is registered multiple times which
    leads to memory corruptions. Therefore, consequent events for a single
    connection are ignored.

    The conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET
    is introduced to identify new connections. To make sure the events do not
    contain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX and checks
    are introduced.

    ath5k: fix OOB in ath5k_eeprom_read_pcal_info_5111

    [ Upstream commit 564d4eceb97eaf381dd6ef6470b06377bb50c95a ]

    The bug was found during fuzzing. Stacktrace locates it in
    ath5k_eeprom_convert_pcal_info_5111.
    When none of the curve is selected in the loop, idx can go
    up to AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES. The line makes pd out of bound.
    pd = &chinfo[pier].pd_curves[idx];

    There are many OOB writes using pd later in the code. So I
    added a sanity check for idx. Checks for other loops involving
    AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES are not needed as the loop index is not
    used outside the loops.

    The patch is NOT tested with real device.

    The following is the fuzzing report

    KVM: x86/emulator: Emulate RDPID only if it is enabled in guest

    [ Upstream commit a836839cbfe60dc434c5476a7429cf2bae36415d ]

    When RDTSCP is supported but RDPID is not supported in host,
    RDPID emulation is available. However, __kvm_get_msr() would
    only fail when RDTSCP/RDPID both are disabled in guest, so
    the emulator wouldn't inject a #UD when RDPID is disabled but
    RDTSCP is enabled in guest.

    KVM: x86/pmu: Fix and isolate TSX-specific performance event logic

    [ Upstream commit e644896f5106aa3f6d7e8c7adf2e4dc0fce53555 ]

    HSW_IN_TX* bits are used in generic code which are not supported on
    AMD. Worse, these bits overlap with AMD EventSelect[11:8] and hence
    using HSW_IN_TX* bits unconditionally in generic code is resulting in
    unintentional pmu behavior on AMD. For example, if EventSelect[11:8]
    is 0x2, pmc_reprogram_counter() wrongly assumes that
    HSW_IN_TX_CHECKPOINTED is set and thus forces sampling period to be 0.

    Also per the SDM, both bits 32 and 33 "may only be set if the processor
    supports HLE or RTM" and for "IN_TXCP (bit 33): this bit may only be set
    for IA32_PERFEVTSEL2."

    Opportunistically eliminate code redundancy, because if the HSW_IN_TX*
    bit is set in pmc->eventsel, it is already set in attr.config.

    KVM: x86/svm: Clear reserved bits written to PerfEvtSeln MSRs

    [ Upstream commit 9b026073db2f1ad0e4d8b61c83316c8497981037 ]

    AMD EPYC CPUs never raise a #GP for a WRMSR to a PerfEvtSeln MSR. Some
    reserved bits are cleared, and some are not. Specifically, on
    Zen3/Milan, bits 19 and 42 are not cleared.

    When emulating such a WRMSR, KVM should not synthesize a #GP,
    regardless of which bits are set. However, undocumented bits should
    not be passed through to the hardware MSR. So, rather than checking
    for reserved bits and synthesizing a #GP, just clear the reserved
    bits.

    This may seem pedantic, but since KVM currently does not support the
    "Host/Guest Only" bits (41:40), it is necessary to clear these bits
    rather than synthesizing #GP, because some popular guests (e.g Linux)
    will set the "Host Only" bit even on CPUs that don't support
    EFER.SVME, and they don't expect a #GP.

    For example,

    root@Ubuntu1804:~# perf stat -e r26 -a sleep 1

     Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

                     0      r26

    The third nybble of AMD's event select overlaps with Intel's IN_TX and
    IN_TXCP bits. Therefore, we can't use AMD64_RAW_EVENT_MASK on Intel
    platforms that support TSX.

    Declare a raw_event_mask in the kvm_pmu structure, initialize it in
    the vendor-specific pmu_refresh() functions, and use that mask for
    PERF_TYPE_RAW configurations in reprogram_gp_counter().

    mm: kfence: fix objcgs vector allocation

    [ Upstream commit 8f0b36497303487d5a32c75789c77859cc2ee895 ]

    If the kfence object is allocated to be used for objects vector, then
    this slot of the pool eventually being occupied permanently since the
    vector is never freed.  The solutions could be (1) freeing vector when
    the kfence object is freed or (2) allocating all vectors statically.

    Since the memory consumption of object vectors is low, it is better to
    chose (2) to fix the issue and it is also can reduce overhead of vectors
    allocating in the future.

    [ Upstream commit e3a33af812c611d99756e2ec61e9d7068d466bdf ]

    Due to dropped inclusion of asm-generic/xor.h, xor_block_8regs symbol is
    missing with CONFIG64 and break compilation, as the asm/xor_64.h also did
    not include it. The patch recreate the logic from arch/x86, which check
    whether AVX is available and add fallbacks for 32bit and 64bit config of
    um.

    A very minor additional "fix" is, the return of the macro parameter
    instead of NULL, as this is the original intent of the macro, but
    this does not change the actual behavior.
