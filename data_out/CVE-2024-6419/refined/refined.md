Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `Master.php` file of the Sourcecodester Medicine Tracker System version 1.0. The vulnerability is triggered due to insufficient sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the POST request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete Data Dump:**  An attacker can potentially extract all data from the database.
- **Account Takeovers:**  The vulnerability can allow an attacker to gain control of user accounts by potentially extracting credentials or manipulating data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `Master.php` with a malicious payload in the 'id' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable 'id' parameter in the POST request.
- **Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify the HTTP request using tools like Burp Suite.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection techniques:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
