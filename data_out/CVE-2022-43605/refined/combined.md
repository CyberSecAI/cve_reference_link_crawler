# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1662

## EIP Stack Group OpENer SetAttributeList attribute\_count\_request out-of-bounds write vulnerability

##### February 23, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-43605

##### SUMMARY

An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the SetAttributeList attribute\_count\_request functionality of EIP Stack Group OpENer development commit 58ee13c. A specially crafted EtherNet/IP request can lead to an out of bounds write, potentially causing the server to crash or allow for remote code execution. An attacker can send a series of EtherNet/IP requests to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

EIP Stack Group OpENer development commit 58ee13c

##### PRODUCT URLS

OpENer - <https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

10.0 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-787 - Out-of-bounds Write

##### DETAILS

OpENer is an EtherNet/IP stack for I/O adapter devices. It supports multiple I/O and explicit connections and includes objects and services for making EtherNet/IP-compliant products as defined in the ODVA specification.

When a `SetAttributeList` request is received, the number of attributes is extracted into `attribute_count_request`. This value is then used as the upper bound for a loop intended to iterate over each requested attribute and add the associated information to the `CipMessageRouterResponse`. This can be seen in the following snippet from `cipcommon.c:SetAttributeList`.

```
...

  CipUint attribute_count_request = GetUintFromMessage(
    &message_router_request->data);

  if(0 != attribute_count_request) {

    EipUint16 attribute_number = 0;
    CipAttributeStruct *attribute = NULL;

    AddIntToMessage(attribute_count_request, &message_router_response->message); // number of attributes in the response

    for(size_t j = 0; j < attribute_count_request; j++) {

      attribute_number = GetUintFromMessage(&message_router_request->data);
      attribute = GetCipAttribute(instance, attribute_number);

      AddIntToMessage(attribute_number, &message_router_response->message); // Attribute-ID

...

```

Within this loop the various fields associated with the attribute currently being processed are added to the response message buffer through use of the `AddIntToMessage` and `AddSintToMessage` functions. Both of these functions are essentially helpers to convert the value in question from the host endianess to little-endian, and then write the converted data to the response buffer.

The `AddIntToMessage` and `AddSintToMessage` functions use the `current_message_position` and `used_message_length` values contained within the `EnipMessage` to determine where within the response message buffer to write the converted data, as shown in the snippet below from `endianconv.c`:

```
/**
 * @brief converts UINT16 data from host to little endian an writes it to buffer.
 * @param data value to be written
 * @param buffer pointer where data should be written.
 */
void AddIntToMessage(const EipUint16 data,
                     ENIPMessage *const outgoing_message) {

  outgoing_message->current_message_position[0] = (unsigned char) data;
  outgoing_message->current_message_position[1] = (unsigned char) (data >> 8);
  outgoing_message->current_message_position += 2;
  outgoing_message->used_message_length += 2;
}

```

When a `SetAttributeList` request containing an `attribute_count_request` of size greater than 0x80 is received, the `outgoing_message->current_message_position` value gets incremented to an address outside of the `EnipMessage` buffer. Subsequent calls to `AddIntToMessage` then write user-supplied data outside of the `EnipMessage` buffer. When specially crafted, this can be used to corrupt the stack and cause the process to crash, resulting in loss of communications with the server and, potentially, code execution.

### Crash Information

```
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
