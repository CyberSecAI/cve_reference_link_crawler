```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `SetAttributeList` function within `cipcommon.c`, where the `attribute_count_request` from the EtherNet/IP request is used as the upper bound of a loop to process attributes. When `attribute_count_request` exceeds 0x80, the `outgoing_message->current_message_position` pointer is incremented out of the bounds of the `EnipMessage` buffer. Subsequent calls to `AddIntToMessage` or `AddSintToMessage` then write data outside of the intended buffer.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient bounds checking on the `attribute_count_request` value leading to memory corruption."
  ],
  "Impact": "Exploitation can lead to a crash of the server due to a stack corruption and potentially remote code execution by controlling the out-of-bounds write to overwrite memory locations.",
   "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted EtherNet/IP request with an `attribute_count_request` value greater than 0x80.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication required."
