PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. In the Prestashop Back office interface, an employee can list all modules without any access rights: method `ajaxProcessGetPossibleHookingListForModule` doesn't check access rights. This issue has been addressed in commit `15bd281c` which is included in version 8.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this issue.
