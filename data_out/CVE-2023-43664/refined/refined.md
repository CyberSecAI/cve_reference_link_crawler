Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `ajaxProcessGetPossibleHookingListForModule` method within the `AdminModulesPositionsController.php` file. This method lacks proper access control checks, allowing users, including employees without view access rights, to list all installed modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of access control verification within the `ajaxProcessGetPossibleHookingListForModule` method. It fails to check if the user has the necessary 'view' permission before fetching and returning the list of possible hooks for a module.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker (or an employee with insufficient permissions) can obtain a list of all installed modules on the PrestaShop instance. This information, while seemingly benign, can be valuable for reconnaissance and further attacks. It provides insight into the system's configuration and potentially vulnerable components, which can be used in other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the PrestaShop back office (BO).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a low level of privileges, specifically, the ability to log in to the PrestaShop back office (BO) as an employee even without specific module view permissions.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.1.2 of PrestaShop.
- The CVSS score is 4.3, which is considered moderate.
- The provided patch shows the fix involves adding an access check `if ($this->access('view'))` before fetching and displaying the module hooking list.
- The vulnerability is referenced by the GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-gvrg-62jp-rf7j`.
