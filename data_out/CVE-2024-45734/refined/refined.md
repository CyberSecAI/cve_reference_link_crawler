Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Splunk Enterprise's PDF export feature handles image references within classic dashboards.
- Specifically, if a low-privileged user creates a classic dashboard that contains an `<img>` tag with a local file path, the PDF export process will include the content of that image file in the exported PDF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Access Control:** Low-privileged users can potentially access files on the Splunk server that they should not have access to.
- **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion:** The vulnerability allows inclusion of local files by using the local image path in the img tag in the source XML code for the Splunk classic dashboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive images or other files stored on the server by including their paths in the img tags of the dashboards and exporting to PDF.
- The severity is rated as medium because if the server does not contain directories with images, or if Splunk Web is turned off, there will be no impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by a user with access to the Splunk web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker needs to have a valid Splunk user account with low privileges that allows them to create and edit classic dashboards.
- **Access to Splunk Web:** The attacker must be able to access the Splunk web interface to create and export dashboards.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated in Splunk Enterprise versions 9.3.1, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6 and later.
- A detection query is provided to identify potentially vulnerable dashboards.
- The provided detection logic looks for PDFs being generated and joins that with classic dashboards that contain at least one img tag.
