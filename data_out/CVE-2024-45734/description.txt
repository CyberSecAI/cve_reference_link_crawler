In Splunk Enterprise versions 9.3.0, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, a low-privileged user that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could view images on the machine that runs Splunk Enterprise by using the PDF export feature in Splunk classic dashboards. The images on the  machine could be exposed by exporting the dashboard as a PDF, using the local image path in the img tag in the source extensible markup language (XML) code for the Splunk classic dashboard.
