# Detection: Splunk Image File Disclosure via PDF Export in Classic Dashboard

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: 7464e2dc-98a5-4af9-87a1-fa6d5a256fa6
Author: Rod Soto
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions 9.3.0, 9.2.3, and 9.1.6, a low-privileged user that does not hold the âadminâ or âpowerâ Splunk roles could view images on the host machine using the PDF export feature in Splunk classic dashboards.

### Search

```
 1```Search for any PDFs that have been generated```
 2index=_internal sourcetype=splunk_pdfgen "Generated pdf"
 3```Extract a potential Dashboard Filename```
 4
 5| rex field=filename "(?<title>.*)-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{1,2}-[0-9]{1,2}.pdf"
 6```Join this with all dashboards. Potentially vulnerable dashbaords MUST be classic (version 1.1) AND contain at least one <img...> tag```
 7
 8| join type=inner title
 9    [
10| rest /servicesNS/-/-/data/ui/views
11
12| search eai:data="*<img*" version="1.1"]
13
14| stats count min(_time) as earliestTime max(_time) as latestTime by author eai:acl.app label title eai:data
15
16| `security_content_ctime(earliestTime)`
17
18| `security_content_ctime(latestTime)`
19
20| `splunk_image_file_disclosure_via_pdf_export_in_classic_dashboard_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_image\_file\_disclosure\_via\_pdf\_export\_in\_classic\_dashboard\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_image_file_disclosure_via_pdf_export_in_classic_dashboard_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Need to access to REST API.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and operator must identify indicators of local host image source such as UNC paths ('C:'', '//'') in order to identify potential exploitation of this vulnerability.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential disclosure of local system source images in dashbaord $label$ by $author$ | 8 | 10 | 80 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
