**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access control checks in the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning an unprivileged (anonymous) user can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in iPages Flipbook plugin versions 1.5.1 and earlier.
*   The issue is fixed in version 1.5.2.
*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated.
