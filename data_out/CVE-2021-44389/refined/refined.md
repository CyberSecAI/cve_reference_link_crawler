The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2021-44389, affecting Reolink RLC-410W IP cameras.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser. Specifically, the code assumes that certain JSON elements, particularly the `param` element, are always objects. When they are not (e.g., a string or null), the code attempts to use the subscription operator on a non-object type which leads to an assertion failure and the termination of the `cgiserver.cgi` process, ultimately causing a device reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the type of JSON elements before attempting to access their members, leading to an assertion failure when it receives unexpected types.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by forcing the device to reboot by sending crafted HTTP requests with specific JSON payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service, causing the device to reboot. This would disrupt the camera's functionality, including recording and monitoring.
-  Repeated exploitation could render the camera unreliable.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests containing a JSON array in the body are sent to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The JSON array contains a `cmd` element specifying the API command to execute, and a `param` element that is expected to be a JSON object but can be crafted as a different type (e.g. string).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the camera.
- While most vulnerable API calls require authentication, a separate vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) can be used to bypass authentication, making unauthenticated exploitation possible for some cases.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with a specific JSON structure in the request body.

**Specific details for CVE-2021-44389:**
- This CVE is specifically related to the `GetAbility` command.
- When the `param` value for the `GetAbility` command is not an object (e.g., an empty string), the parsing logic in the `cgiserver.cgi` application will trigger the described assertion failure, leading to device reboot.

**Example exploit scenario:**
An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the camera with the following JSON body:
```json
[
    {
        "cmd": "GetAbility",
        "action": 0,
        "param":  ""
    }
]
```
This will cause the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and the camera to reboot.
