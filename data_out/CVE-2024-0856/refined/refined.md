The provided content relates to CVE-2024-0856.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Booking Calendar plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in some areas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to induce logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make logged-in users add bookings to the calendar without their consent, potentially bypassing payment or other requirements.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form that is submitted by a logged-in user, typically by tricking the user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting the crafted form. They do not need to be authenticated to the target WordPress site.
