- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper permission settings in the Whale browser installer.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The installer allows an attacker to execute a malicious DLL.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution in the user environment.
- Attack vectors: Exploiting the installer's permission settings to load a malicious DLL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to influence the installer's execution environment to load a malicious DLL, but the specific requirements are not explicitly described.
