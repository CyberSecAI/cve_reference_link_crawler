# CloudCore Router: Large HTTP response can exhaust memory in REST handler

Moderate

[kevin-wangzefeng](/kevin-wangzefeng)
published
GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm
Jul 11, 2022

## Package

gomod

KubeEdge
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=1.11.0, 1.10.1, 1.9.3

## Patched versions

1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4

## Description

### Impact

The CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service.

Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` as below.

```
modules:
  ...
  router:
    enable: true

```
### Patches

This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, 1.9.4. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

Disable the router module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
