Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31177:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to filter users based on their salted and hashed password strings through HTTP requests. Specifically, the application allowed filtering by partial hashed password strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leakage: The system exposes the ability to filter users based on partial password hashes.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The application does not properly validate or sanitize input used for filtering, allowing partial password hashes to be used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated admin user could infer partial password hashes and their corresponding users by crafting specific HTTP requests to filter users. Although the full hashed password is not exposed, knowledge of partial password hashes could aid in a brute-force or dictionary attack on user accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Requests:  Crafted HTTP requests using query strings.
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when using the `AUTH_DB` authentication option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated admin user: The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of how to craft HTTP requests to filter users based on query string.
