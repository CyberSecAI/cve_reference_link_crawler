## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Flo Launch < 2.4.1 - Missing Authentication Allow Full Site Takeover

### Description

The plugin injects code into wp-config.php when creating a cloned site, allowing any attacker to initiate a new site install by setting the flo\_custom\_table\_prefix cookie to an arbitrary value.

### Proof of Concept

On any website where flo-launch is active create cookie "flo\_custom\_table\_prefix" with any string value to initiate new WordPress instance setup.
Complete setup and login as admin.
