- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin injects code into `wp-config.php` when creating a cloned site. This allows an attacker to initiate a new WordPress site setup by manipulating the `flo_custom_table_prefix` cookie.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication and insecure code injection. The plugin fails to properly authenticate site cloning requests, allowing an unauthenticated user to trigger a new WordPress installation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Full site takeover. An attacker can initiate a new WordPress install, complete the setup, and gain administrator access.
- **Attack vectors:** By setting the `flo_custom_table_prefix` cookie to an arbitrary value on a vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, the attacker only needs to be able to set cookies on the target's browser and visit the vulnerable site.
