Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-27036.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of folio processing during CIFS writeback operations. Specifically, when `cifs_extend_writeback()` encounters a situation where including an additional folio would exceed the write size (`wsize`), it exits the xarray scanning loop by calling `xas_pause()`. The issue is that `xas_pause()` increments the loop counter, causing the next folio to be skipped, leading to data corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper loop counter management in `cifs_extend_writeback()` when write size limit is reached
- Inconsistent handling of folio processing during writeback operations
- Usage of `filemap_get_folios_tag()` which causes retry of pages already dealt with.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Data corruption during CIFS writeback operations. In the provided test case, a 64KB file copied to a CIFS share with a `wsize` of 64000 resulted in a mismatch between the source and destination files. Specifically, the `cmp` command fails at position 64000 or shortly after.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by writing to a file on a CIFS share mounted with a specific `wsize` (e.g., 64000). The issue occurs when the writeback process attempts to write data that spans multiple folios, but the write size limit is reached.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to mount a CIFS share.
- Ability to write data to the mounted CIFS share.
- Control over the `wsize` mount option.
