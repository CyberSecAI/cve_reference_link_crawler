#### Create Testimonials that Are Mobile-Friendly Using Testimonial Plugin

It‚Äôs not enough to just display testimonials on your website. If your testimonial slider or testimonial carousel shows up wonky on mobile devices, then it defeats the purpose of the testimonials.

This is why it‚Äôs critical to ensure your testimonials are mobile-friendly, especially with nearly 5 billion mobile device users across the world. With the Stars Testimonials plugin, you don‚Äôt have to worry about this.

All of your testimonials will display on mobile devices in a way that‚Äôs accessible and legible.

#### Why Testimonials and Reviews Are Important for Business

It doesn‚Äôt matter what industry you‚Äôre in ‚Äì testimonials are an indication of the quality of your products and services.

A whopping 84% of consumers trust online reviews, which provides them with first-hand knowledge about a brand. If your company has an onslaught of negative online reviews, then your business will suffer tremendously.

This is because the majority of online users are using Google to find info about a brand before doing business with them. About 82% of smartphone users consult with the web before making a purchase in-store.

But it‚Äôs not just in-store purchases online reviews affect. Eighty-eight percent of consumers conduct online searches before making a purchase from both online and physical stores.

By taking charge of your online reputation and displaying testimonials on your website, you can help convert more visitors into paying customers.

#### Use Cases for Review Plugin

There are several ways businesses can use website testimonials to grow their sales. Let‚Äôs take a look at a few.

* **Get More Local Clients**

If you‚Äôre a local dental office, clinic, realtor, or other professional, you can use testimonials to drive more foot traffic to your business. With the testimonial slider implemented onto your homepage, you can show off customers‚Äô reviews.

Prospects see it and decide to schedule an appointment with your office.

* **Increase Your Subscriptions**

Trying to grow your email subscriber list? Then you can use a testimonial carousel on your landing page to drive more visitors to sign up.

You can display the testimonial rotator at the bottom of your blog posts or on a specific landing page designed to convince visitors to sign up for your newsletter. Your email list is a key component in a marketing strategy, as it can help boost your conversions.

* **Boost Your Online Sales**

Selling products and services online? Then you can bet your visitors are going to look for peer reviews before buying from your brand.

You can help steer them towards purchase by showcasing your testimonials on multiple areas of your site. For example, on the home page, products or services page, and about us page.

When prospects see images, star ratings, and reviews from happy customers, they‚Äôre more inclined to make the purchase.

These are just some of the use cases for implementing WordPress review plugins to grow your business.

#### Create a Testimonials Page

If you want to gain more trust and social proof, you can easily create a testimonials page with all of your customers‚Äô reviews. All you need to do is to create a new page and embed a shortcode that includes all your testimonials.

The plugin is easy to install and offers numerous options for displaying the testimonials on your website. Since my clients often describe their experiences with my consulting services in great detail, the character limit function is helpful. Unfortunately, the ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù button was not displayed. No problem for the supportcenter, the guys solved the problem in a very short time by accessing my website. Thank you for the great support.
