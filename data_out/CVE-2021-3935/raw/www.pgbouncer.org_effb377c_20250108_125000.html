<p><strong>2024-08-02  -  PgBouncer 1.23.1  -  “Everything is put back in order”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix a possible segmentation fault after PgBouncer reloads its
configuration. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1105">#1105</a>) (bug introduced in 1.23.0)</li>
      <li>Fix all known put_in_order crashes. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1120">#1120</a>)
(new crashes were introduced in 1.23.0)</li>
      <li>Add missing files to release tarball that are required for testing.
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1124">#1124</a>) (missing files were introduced in 1.23.0)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2024-07-03  -  PgBouncer 1.23.0  -  “Into the new beginnings”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for rolling restarts. SIGTERM doesn’t cause immediate shutdown
of the PgBouncer process anymore. It now does a “super safe shutdown”:
waiting for all clients to disconnect before shutting down. The new SIGTERM
behaviour allows rolling restarts of multiple PgBouncer processes behind a
load balancer, or listening on the same port using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so_reuseport</code>.
This is a <strong>minor breaking change</strong>. If you relied on the old behaviour of
SIGTERM in your Dockerfile or Systemd service file you should now use SIGQUIT.
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/902">#902</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for user name maps for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cert</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peer</code> authentication
methods. This feature provides the flexibility that the user initiating
the connection does not have to be the database user. PgBouncer support
for user name maps works very similar to the postgres with the exceptions
listed in the docs. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/996">#996</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for replication connections through PgBouncer. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/876">#876</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes
    <ul>
      <li>Improve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW USERS</code> output listing the connections. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1040">#1040</a>)</li>
      <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pool_size</code> configuration per user. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1049">#1049</a>)</li>
      <li>Allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server_lifetime</code> configuration per database. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1057">#1057</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for listing dynamically created users in the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW USERS</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1052">#1052</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all</code> address type in hba configuration. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1078">#1078</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for automatically restarting when using systemd. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1080">#1080</a>)</li>
      <li>Increase c-ares minimum version requirement to 1.9.0 (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1076">#1076</a>)</li>

      <li>Add support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--config=value</code> format in options startup parameter. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1064">#1064</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avg_wait_time</code> metric calculation. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/727">#727</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for negotiating the postgres protocol version with the client. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1007">#1007</a>)</li>
      <li>Add outstanding request for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_query</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1034">#1034</a>)</li>
      <li>Multiple documentation and CI improvements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-122x">PgBouncer 1.22.x</h2>

<p><strong>2024-03-04  -  PgBouncer 1.22.1  -  “It’s summer in Bangalore”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix issues caused by some clients using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COPY FROM STDIN</code> queries. Such
queries could introduce memory leaks, performance regressions and prepared
statement misbehavior. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1025">#1025</a>)

      <li>Fix handling of empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application_name</code> (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/999">#999</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix building on Windows with OpenSSL 3.2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/1009">#1009</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-121x">PgBouncer 1.21.x</h2>

<p><strong>2023-10-16  -  PgBouncer 1.21.0  -  “The one with prepared statements”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for protocol-level named prepared statements! This is probably
one of the most requested features for PgBouncer. Using prepared statements
together with PgBouncer can reduce the CPU load on your system a lot (both
at the PgBouncer side and the PostgreSQL side). In synthetic benchmarks
this feature was able to increase query throughput anywhere from 15% to
250%, depending on the workload. To benefit from this new feature you need
to change the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_prepared_statements</code> setting to a non-zero value
(the exact value depends on your workload, but 100 is probably reasonable).
See <a href="https://pgbouncer.org/config.html#max_prepared_statements">the docs on
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_prepared_statements</code></a>
for details on how the feature works, its limitations, and how to tune the
value. After doing that you need to make sure your client library
actually uses prepared statements. How to do that differs for each client,
so you should look at the docs for the client you’re using. This feature
has been tested very well before releasing, but performance issues or
bugs might very well exist due to the complexity of the feature. If you
find those, please report them. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/845">#845</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Changes
    <ul>
      <li>Improve security of OpenSSL settings, the defaults used were VERY outdated.
With this release the defaults are now the same as the OpenSSL defaults of the
system that runs PgBouncer. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/948">#948</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/libusual/libusual/pull/41">libusual/#41</a>)</li>
      <li>PgBouncer now uses OpenSSL to calculate MD5 hashes when possible. This is
necessary to use PgBouncer in a FIPS compliant way. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/949">#949</a>)</li>
      <li>Maintain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min_pool_size</code> for pools with a forced user even if no clients
are connected to PgBouncer (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/947">#947</a>)</li>
      <li>The way a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peer_id</code> is encoded in the cancellation token by PgBouncer has
changed, this means that peering between different PgBouncer versions will
not work if not all of them are on the same side of the v1.21.0 version
boundary. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/945">#945</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix crash with error message: “FATAL in function client_proto(): bad
client state: 6/7” (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/928">#928</a>) (bug introduced in 1.18.0)</li>
      <li>Fix crash with error message: “FATAL in function server_proto(): server in
bad state: 11” (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/927">#927</a>) (bug introduced in 1.18.0)</li>
      <li>Reduce cancellation sending log level (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/903">#903</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix slog log prefix for peers (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/922">#922</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix typos in docs (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/932">#932</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix errors pointed out by static analyzer (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/943">#943</a>)</li>
      <li>Don’t kill all waiting clients on temporary FATAL errors during login (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/946">#946</a>)</li>
      <li>Use auto-database when database in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_dbname</code> is not explicitly configured
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/921">#921</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanup
    <ul>
      <li>Remove support for udns (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/938">#938</a>)</li>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-120x">PgBouncer 1.20.x</h2>

<p><strong>2023-08-09  -  PgBouncer 1.20.1  -  “Optional options”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix regression where putting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignore_startup_parameters</code>
would not ignore unknown parameters inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> startup parameter
anymore. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/908">#908</a>) (regression was introduced in 1.20.0)</li>
      <li>Fix confusing typo in the docs (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/917">#917</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2023-07-20  -  PgBouncer 1.20.0  -  “A funny name goes here”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Deprecations
    <ul>
      <li>Online restart option is now considered deprecated. The feature has
received very little love in recent years. There are multiple known issues
with it and newly added features often don’t support it. The recommended
method to do online restarts these days is using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so_reuseport</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peers</code> feature. That way you can have multiple different PgBouncer
processes running on the same port. Then by restarting those processes
one-by-one, you can make sure there’s always a PgBouncer process listening
on the desired port. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/894">#894</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">track_extra_parameters</code> which allows tracking of more
parameters in transaction pooling mode. Previously, PgBouncer only tracked
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application_name</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DateStyle</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TimeZone</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard_conforming_strings</code>. Now PgBouncer also tracks <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntervalStyle</code> by
default. And by changing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">track_extra_parameters</code> you can track even more
settings, but only <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-ASYNC">ones that PostgreSQL reports back to the
client</a>. If you’re using Citus 12.0+, then Citus will make sure
that PostgreSQL also reports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_path</code> back to the client. So if you use
Citus you can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_path</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">track_extra_parameters</code> setting.
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/867">#867</a>)</li>
      <li>Forward SQLSTATE in authentication phase. This allows the detection of
database not existing, which is done by Npgsql (a .NET data provider for
PostgreSQL). (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/814">#814</a>)</li>
      <li>Change default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server_tls_sslmode</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prefer</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/866">#866</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">options</code> startup parameter. This allows usage of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#id-1.6.7.4.5">the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PGOPTIONS</code> environment variable that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psql</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libpq</code> know
about</a>. Using this variable you can set any PostgreSQL parameter at
startup. This only works for PostgreSQL parameters that PgBouncer tracks
through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">track_extra_parameters</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/878">#878</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t crash when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgbouncer</code> admin database is used as auth_dbname. It’s
still not supported, but this now gives a clear error instead of crashing.
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/817">#817</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix name of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peer_cache</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW MEM</code>. It was incorrectly showing up as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db_cache</code> before. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/864">#864</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix src/dst confusion in log. PgBouncer was logging a source IP when it
meant to log the destination IP. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/880">#880</a>)</li>
      <li>Only log admin connections over unix sockets when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log_connections</code> is set
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/883">#883</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>2023-05-04  -  PgBouncer 1.19.0  -  “The old-fashioned, human-generated kind”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_dbname</code> option, which specifies against which database
to run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_query</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/764">#764</a>)</li>
      <li>Add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW STATE</code> command, which shows if PgBouncer is active,
paused or suspended. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/528">#528</a>)</li>
      <li>Add support for peering between PgBouncer processes.  This allows
configuring PgBouncer such that cancellation requests continue to
work when multiple different PgBouncer processes are behind a
single load balancer. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/666">#666</a>)</li>
      <li>Add a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cancel_wait_timeout</code> setting, which determines

<p><strong>2022-03-23  -  PgBouncer 1.17.0  -  “A line has been drawn”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>A database definition can specify a comma-separated host list.
The hosts will be connected to in a round-robin manner.</li>
      <li>When connecting to a non-existing database, the error (“no such
database”) is now reported after authentication.  This prevents
unauthenticated clients from probing what databases exist.  (This
is similar to the change in version 1.15.0 to report missing users
after authentication.)</li>
      <li>Don’t send server disconnect errors to the client before login.
This could reveal not-quite-public information, such as
configuration details, to a client that is not logged in yet.</li>
      <li>Increase maximum password length again.  Apparently, the last
increase wasn’t enough for long enough.</li>
      <li>Remove automatic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_file</code> reload.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_file</code> is now
reread only on configuration file reload, no longer automatically
as soon as it is changed.</li>
      <li>The Windows build now includes a version-information resource
file.</li>
      <li>The Windows builds created on CI are now statically linked, so
they can be used directly without requiring any dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>OpenSSL 3 support has been fixed.  Previous releases would crash.</li>
      <li>Don’t apply fast-fail at connect time.  This is part of the
above-mentioned change to not report server errors before
authentication.  It also fixes a particular situation with SCRAM
pass-through authentication, where we need to allow the
client-side authentication exchange in order to be able to fix the
server-side connection by re-authenticating.  The fast-fail
mechanism still applies right after authentication, so the
effective observed behavior will be the same in most situations.</li>
      <li>Change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_type</code> in sample <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pgbouncer.ini</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md5</code> to match the
built-in default.  Some deploy this file as the default
configuration file, so check if this changed configuration still
makes sense for you.</li>
      <li>Fix crash at exit in assert-enabled builds.</li>
      <li>Improve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tcp_defer_accept</code> documentation and behavior.  The
documentation was incorrect and misleading about the default.  In
some cases the wrong value was showing in “show config”.  Also, if
it’s set but not supported, give an error instead of ignoring,
similar to how other platform-specific socket options are handled.</li>
      <li>Fix build with c-ares on Windows.  c-ares &gt;=1.18.0 is now required
on Windows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanups
    <ul>
      <li>Most deprecation warnings from Autoconf &gt;=2.70 have been cleaned
up.  Older Autoconf versions are still supported.</li>
      <li>Cirrus CI use has been expanded to more platforms.</li>
      <li>Travis CI support has been removed.</li>
      <li>Update locations to search for default root CA file, to cover more
platforms, such as Fedora/RHEL/CentOS.</li>
      <li>Python scripts now all use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3</code> by default.  Python 2
compatibility is no longer maintained.</li>
      <li>The test suite scripts use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">command -v</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which</code>, which
is deprecated.</li>
      <li>Several error messages have been reworded to make it clearer which
command or configuration setting they relate to.</li>
      <li>The test suite scripts no longer require GNU sed.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make check</code> now works on Windows (but not the SSL test suite
yet).</li>
      <li>Document that the admin console only supports the simple query
protocol, and give better error messages about this.</li>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-116x">PgBouncer 1.16.x</h2>

<p><strong>2021-11-11  -  PgBouncer 1.16.1  -  “Test of depth against quiet efficiency”</strong></p>

<p>This is a minor release with a security fix.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make PgBouncer acting as a server reject extraneous data after an
SSL or GSS encryption handshake.</p>

    <p>A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP
connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a
supposedly encryption-protected database session.  This could be
abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although that would
only work if PgBouncer did not demand any authentication data.
(However, a PgBouncer setup relying on SSL certificate
authentication might well not do so.)  (CVE-2021-3935)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2021-08-09  -  PgBouncer 1.16.0  -  “Fended off a jaguar”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Support hot reloading of TLS settings.  When the configuration
file is reloaded, changed TLS settings automatically take effect.</li>
      <li>Add support for abstract Unix-domain sockets.  Prefix a
Unix-domain socket path with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code> to use a socket in the abstract
namespace.  This matches the corresponding PostgreSQL 14 feature.</li>
      <li>The maximum lengths of passwords and user names have been
increased to 996 and 128, respectively.  Various cloud services
require this.</li>
      <li>The minimum pool size can now be set per database, similar to the
regular pool size and the reserve pool size.</li>
      <li>The number of pending query cancellations is shown in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW
POOLS</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration parsing now has tighter error handling in many
places.  Where previously it might have logged an error and
proceeded, those configuration errors would now result in startup
failures.  This is what always should have happened, but some code
didn’t do this right.  Some users might discover that their
configurations have been faulty all along and will not work
anymore.</li>
      <li>Query cancel handling has been fixed.  Under some circumstances,
cancel requests would seemingly get stuck for a long time.  This
should no longer happen.  In fact, cancel requests can now exceed
the pool size by a factor of two, so they really shouldn’t get
stuck
anymore. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/542">#542</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/543">#543</a>)</li>
      <li>Mixed use of md5 and scram via hba has been fixed.</li>
      <li>The build with c-ares on Windows has been fixed.</li>
      <li>The dreaded “FIXME: query end, but query_start == 0” messages have
been fixed.  We now know why they happen, and you shouldn’t see
them anymore. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/565">#565</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix reloading of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default_pool_size</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min_pool_size</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">res_pool_size</code>.  Reloading these settings previously didn’t work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanups
    <ul>
      <li>Cirrus CI is now
<a href="https://cirrus-ci.com/github/pgbouncer/pgbouncer">used</a> instead
of Travis CI.</li>
      <li>As usual, many tests have been added.</li>
      <li>The “unclean server” log message has been clarified a bit.  It now
says “client disconnect while server was not ready” or “client
disconnect before everything was sent to the server”.  The former
can happen if the client connection is closed when the server has
a transaction block open, which confused some users.</li>
      <li>You can no longer use “pgbouncer” as a database name.  This name
is reserved for the admin console, and using it as a normal
database name never really worked right.  This is now explicitly
prohibited.</li>
      <li>Errors sent to clients before the connection is closed are now
labeled as FATAL instead of just ERROR.  Some clients were
confused
otherwise. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/564">#564</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix compiler warnings with GCC 11.

<h2 id="pgbouncer-115x">PgBouncer 1.15.x</h2>

<p><strong>2020-11-19  -  PgBouncer 1.15.0  -  “Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Improve authentication failure reporting.  The authentication
failure messages sent to the client now only state that
authentication failed but give no further details.  Details are
available in the PgBouncer log.  Also, if the requested user does
not exist, the authentication is still processed to the end and
will result in the same generic failure message.  All this
prevents clients from probing the PgBouncer instance for user
names and other authentication-related insights.  This is similar
to how PostgreSQL behaves.</li>
      <li>Don’t log anything if client disconnects immediately.  This avoids
log spam when monitoring systems just open a TCP/IP connection but
don’t send anything before disconnecting.</li>
      <li>Use systemd journal for logging when in use.  When we detect that
stderr is going to the systemd journal, we use systemd native
functions for log output.  This avoids printing duplicate
timestamp and pid, thus making the log a bit cleaner.  Also, this
adds metadata such as the severity to the logs, so that if the
journal gets sent on to syslog, the messages have useful metadata
attached.</li>
      <li>A subset of the test suite can now be run under Windows.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW CONFIG</code> now also shows the default values of the settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so_reuseport</code> option on FreeBSD.  The original code in
PgBouncer 1.12.0 didn’t actually work on FreeBSD.
(<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/504">#504</a>)</li>
      <li>Repair compilation on systems with older systemd versions.  This
was broken in 1.14.0.

      <li>The makefile target to build Windows binary zip packages has been
repaired.</li>
      <li>Long command-line options now also work on Windows.</li>
      <li>Fix the behavior of the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auth_user</code> setting.  The old
behavior was confusing and fragile as it depended on the order in
the configuration file.  This is no longer the
case. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/391">#391</a>,

      <li>Add support for systemd socket activation.  This is especially

<p>This release contains a variety of minor enhancements and fixes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Add a setting to turn on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SO_REUSEPORT</code> socket option.  On
some operating systems, this allows running multiple PgBouncer
instances on the same host listening on the same port and having
the kernel distribute the connections automatically.</li>
      <li>Add a setting to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resolv.conf</code> file separate from the
operating system.  This allows setting custom DNS servers and
perhaps other DNS options.</li>
      <li>Send the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW VERSION</code> as a normal result row instead
of a NOTICE message.  This makes it easier to consume and is
consistent with other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHOW</code> commands.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Send statistics columns as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numeric</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bigint</code>.  This
avoids some client libraries failing on values that overflow the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bigint</code>
range. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/360">#360</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/pull/401">#401</a>)</li>
      <li>Fix issue with PAM users losing their
password. (<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/285">#285</a>)</li>
      <li>Accept SCRAM channel binding enabled clients.  Previously, a
client supporting channel binding (that is, PostgreSQL 11+) would
get a connection failure when connecting to PgBouncer in certain
situations.  (PgBouncer does not support channel binding.  This
change just fixes support for clients that offer it.)</li>
      <li>Fix compilation with newer versions of musl-libc (used by Alpine
Linux).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanups

      <li>Remove references to the PostgreSQL wiki.  All information is now
either in the PgBouncer documentation or on the web site.</li>
      <li>Remove support for Libevent version 1.x.  Libevent 2.x is now
required.  Libevent is now detected using pkg-config.</li>

<p><strong>2016-02-18  -  PgBouncer 1.7.1  -  “Forward To Five Friends Or Else”</strong></p>

<p>WARNING: Since version 1.7, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server_reset_query</code> is not executed when
database is in transaction-pooling mode.  Seems this was not highlighted
enough in 1.7 announcement.  If your apps depend on that happening, use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server_reset_query_always</code> to restore previous behaviour.</p>

<p>Otherwise main work of this release was to track down TLS-related memory
leak, which turned out to not exist.  Instead there is libssl build in
Debian/wheezy which has 600k overhead per connection (without leaking)
instead expected 20-30k.  Something to keep an eye on when using TLS.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes

      <li>TLS: Rename sslmode “disabled” to “disable” as that is what
PostgreSQL uses.</li>
      <li>TLS: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client_tls_sslmode=verify-ca/-full</code> now reject

unconfigured so connections with client cert failed.

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Support TLS connections.  OpenSSL/LibreSSL is used
as backend implementation.</li>
      <li>Support authentication via TLS client certificate.</li>
      <li>Support “peer” authentication on Unix sockets.</li>
      <li>Support Host Based Access control file, like
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">pg_hba.conf</a>
in Postgres.  This allows to configure TLS for network connections and “peer”
authentication for local connections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanups
    <ul>
      <li>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query_wait_timeout</code> to 120s by default.  Current default
(0) causes infinite queueing, which is not useful.  That
means if client has pending query and has not been
assigned to server connection, the client connection will
be dropped.</li>
      <li>Disable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server_reset_query_always</code> by default.  Now reset
query is used only in pools that are in session mode.</li>
      <li>Increase pkt_buf to 4096 bytes.  Improves performance with TLS.
The behaviour is probably load-specific, but it should be
safe to do as since v1.2 the packet buffers are split
from connections and used lazily from pool.</li>
      <li>Support pipelining count expected ReadyForQuery packets.
This avoids releasing server too early.  Fixes
<a href="https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer/issues/52">#52</a>.</li>
      <li>Improved sbuf_loopcnt logic - socket is guarateed to be
reprocessed even if there are no event from socket.
Required for TLS as it has it’s own buffering.</li>
      <li>Adapt system tests to work with modern BSD and MacOS.
(Eric Radman)</li>
      <li>Remove <strong>crypt</strong> auth.  It’s obsolete and not supported
by PostgreSQL since 8.4.</li>
      <li>Fix plain “–with-cares” configure option - without argument
it was broken.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Features</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Async DNS lookup - instead of resolving hostnames at reload time,
the names are now resolved at connect time, with configurable caching.
(See dns_max_ttl parameter.)</p>

        <p>By default it uses getaddrinfo_a() (glibc) as backend, if it does not
exist, then getaddrinfo_a() is emulated via blocking(!) getaddrinfo().</p>

        <p>When –enable-evdns argument to configure, libevent’s evdns is used
as backend.  It is not used by default, because libevent 1.3/1.4
contain buggy implementation.  Only evdns in libevent 2.0 seems OK.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New config var: syslog_ident, to tune syslog name.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Proper support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">application_name</code> startup parameter.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New config var: disable_pqexec.  Highly-paranoid environments
can disable Simple Query Protocol with that.  Requires apps
that use only Extended Query Protocol.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Postgres compat: if database name is empty in startup packet,
use user name as database.</p>

<p><strong>2010-09-09  -  PgBouncer 1.3.4  -  “Bouncer is always right”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Apply fast-fail logic at connect time.  So if server is failing,
the clients get error when connecting.</li>
      <li>Don’t tag automatically generated databases for checking on reload time,
otherwise they get killed, because they don’t exist in config.</li>
      <li>Ignore application_name parameter by default.  This avoids the need
for all Postgres 9.0 users to add it into ignore_startup_parameters=
themselves.</li>
      <li>Correct pg_auth quoting.  ‘' is not used there.</li>
      <li>Better error reporting on console, show incoming query to user.</li>
      <li>Support OS’es (OpenBSD) where tv_sec is not time_t.</li>

<p><strong>2010-05-10  -  PgBouncer 1.3.3  -  “NSFW”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>Make listen(2) argument configurable: listen_backlog.  This is
useful on OS’es, where system max allowed is configurable.</li>
      <li>Improve disconnect messages to show what username or dbname caused
login to fail.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Move fast-fail relaunch logic around.  Old one was annoying in case of
permanently broken databases or users, by trying to retry even if
there is no clients who want to login.</li>
      <li>Make logging functions keep old errno, otherwise pgbouncer may act funny
on higher loglevels and logging problems.</li>
      <li>Increase the size of various startup-related buffers to handle
EDB more noisy startup.</li>
      <li>Detect V2 protocol startup request and give clear reason for disconnect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2010-03-15  -  PgBouncer 1.3.2  -  “Boomerang Bullet”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>New config var ‘query_wait_timeout’.  If client does not get
server connection in this many seconds, it will be killed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If no server connection in pool and last connect failed, then
don’t put client connections on hold but send error immediately.</p>

        <p>This together with previous fix avoids unnecessary stalls if
a database has gone down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Track libevent state in sbuf.c to avoid double event_del().  Although
it usually is safe, it does not seem to work 100%.  Now we should always
know whether it has been called or not.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Disable maintenance during SUSPEND.  Otherwise with short timeouts
the old bouncer could close few connections after sending them over.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Apply client_login_timeout to clients waiting for welcome packet
(first server connection).  Otherwise they can stay waiting
infinitely, unless there is query_timeout set.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>win32: Add switch -U/-P to -regservice to let user pick account
to run service under.  Old automatic choice between Local Service and
Local System was not reliable enough.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>console: Remove \0 from end of text columns.  It was hard to notice,
as C clients were fine with it.</p>

<p><strong>2009-07-06  -  PgBouncer 1.3.1  -  “Now fully conforming to NSA monitoring requirements”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Fix problem with sbuf_loopcnt which could make connections hang.
If query or result length is nearby of multiple of (pktlen*sbuf_loopcnt)
[10k by default], it could stay waiting for more data which will not
appear.</li>
      <li>Make database reconfigure immediate.  Currently old connections
could be reused after SIGHUP.</li>
      <li>Fix SHOW DATABASES which was broken due to column addition.</li>
      <li>Console access was disabled when “auth_type=any” as pgbouncer dropped username.
Fix: if “auth_type=any”, allow any user to console as admin.</li>
      <li>Fix bad CUSTOM_ALIGN macro.  Luckily it’s unused if OS already
defines ALIGN macro thus seems the bug has not happened in wild.</li>
      <li>win32: call WSAStartup() always, not only in daemon mode
as config parsing wants to resolve hosts.</li>
      <li>win32: put quotes around config filename in service
cmdline to allow spaces in paths.  Executable path
does not seem to need it due to some win32 magic.</li>
      <li>Add STATS to SHOW HELP text.</li>
      <li>doc/usage.txt: the time units in console results are in
microseconds, not milliseconds.</li>

<p><strong>2009-02-18  -  PgBouncer 1.3 -  “New Ki-Smash Finishing Move”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Features</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>IANA has assigned port 6432 to be official port for PgBouncer.
Thus the default port number has changed to 6432.  Existing
individual users do not need to change, but if you distribute
packages of PgBouncer, please change the package default
to official port.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dynamic database creation (David Galoyan)</p>

        <p>Now you can define database with name “*”.  If defined, it’s connect
string will be used for all undefined databases.  Useful mostly
for test / dev environments.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Windows support (Hiroshi Saito)</p>

        <p>PgBouncer runs on Windows 2000+ now.  Command line usage stays same,
except it cannot run as daemon and cannot do online reboot.
To run as service, define parameter service_name in config. Then:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; pgbouncer.exe config.ini -regservice
&gt; net start SERVICE_NAME
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>To stop and unregister:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; net stop SERVICE_NAME
&gt; pgbouncer.exe config.ini -unregservice
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>To use Windows Event Log, event DLL needs to be registered first:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; regsrv32 pgbevent.dll
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>Afterwards you can set “syslog = 1” in config.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minor features</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Database names in config file can now be quoted with standard SQL
ident quoting, to allow non-standard characters in db names.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New tunables: ‘reserve_pool_size’ and ‘reserve_pool_timeout’.
In case there are clients in pool that have waited more that
‘reserve_pool_timeout’ seconds, ‘reserve_pool_size’ specifies
the number of connections that can be added to pool.  It can also
set per-pool with ‘reserve_pool’ connection variable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New tunable ‘sbuf_loopcnt’ to limit time spent on one socket.</p>

        <p>In some situations - eg SMP server, local Postgres and fast network -
pgbouncer can run recv()-&gt;send() loop many times without blocking
on either side.  But that means other connections will stall for
a long time.  To make processing more fair, limit the times
of doing recv()-&gt;send() one socket.  If count reaches limit,
just proceed processing other sockets.  The processing for
that socket will resume on next event loop.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Alexander Schöcke for report and testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>crypt() authentication is now optional, as it was removed from Postgres.
If OS does not provide it, pgbouncer works fine without it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add milliseconds to log timestamps.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In case event_del() reports failure, just proceed with cleanup.
Previously pgbouncer retried it, in case the failure was due ENOMEM.
But this has caused log floods with infinite repeats, so it seems
libevent does not like it.</p>

        <p>Why event_del() report failure first time is still mystery.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>–enable-debug now just toggles whether debug info is stripped from binary.
It no longer plays with -fomit-frame-pointer as it’s dangerous.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fix include order, as otherwise system includes could come before
internal ones.  Was problem for new md5.h include file.</p>
      </li>

        <p>(Teodor Sigaev)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New config var ‘ignore_startup_parameters’ to allow and ignore
extra parameters in startup packet.  By default only ‘database’
and ‘user’ are allowed, all others raise error.  This is needed
to tolerate overenthusiastic JDBC wanting to unconditionally
set ‘extra_float_digits=2’ in startup packet.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Logging to syslog: new parameters syslog=0/1 and
syslog_facility=daemon/user/local0.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fake some parameters on console SHOW/SET commands to be more Postgres-like.
That was needed to allow psycopg to connect to console.
(client_encoding/default_transaction_isolation/datestyle/timezone)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make server_lifetime=0 disconnect server connection immediately
after first use.  Previously “0” made PgBouncer ignore server age.
As this behavior was undocumented, there should not be any users
depending on it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Internal improvements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Packet buffers are allocated lazily and reused.  This should bring
huge decrease in memory usage.  This also makes realistic to use
big pktbuf with lot of connections.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Lot’s of error handling improvements, PgBouncer should now
survive OOM situations gracefully.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use slab allocator for memory management.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Lots of code cleanups.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Only single accept() was issued per event loop which could
cause connection backlog when having high amount of connection
attempts.  Now the listening socket is always drained fully,
which should fix this.</li>
      <li>Handle EINTR from connect().</li>
      <li>Make configure.ac compatible with autoconf 2.59.</li>
      <li>Solaris compatibility fixes (Magne Mæhre)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-11x">PgBouncer 1.1.x</h2>

<p><strong>2007-12-10  -  PgBouncer 1.1.2  -  “The Hammer”</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Features
    <ul>
      <li>Disconnects because of server_lifetime are now separated by
(server_lifetime / pool_size) seconds.  This avoids pgbouncer
causing reconnect floods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Online upgrade 1.0 -&gt; 1.1 problems:
        <ul>
          <li>1.0 does not track server parameters, so they stay NULL
but 1.1 did not expect it and crashed.</li>
          <li>If server params are unknown, but client ones are set,
then issue a SET for them, instead complaining.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Remove temp debug statements that were accidentally left
in code on INFO level, so they polluted logs.</li>
      <li>Unbroke debian/changelog</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>reorder struct SBuf fields to get better alignment for buffer.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Server parameter cache could stay uninitialized, which caused

does not allow touching standard_conforming_strings.
(Thanks to Dimitri Fontaine for report &amp; testing.)</li>
      <li>Some doc fixes.</li>
      <li>Include doc/fixman.py in .tgz.</li>

</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Database connect string enhancements:</p>

        <ul>

      <li>New config var: server_round_robin, to switch between LIFO and RR.</li>
      <li>Cancel pkt sent for idle connection does not drop it anymore.</li>
      <li>Cancel with ^C from psql works for SUSPEND / PAUSE.</li>
      <li>Print FD limits on startup.</li>
      <li>When suspending, try to hit packet boundary ASAP.</li>
      <li>Add ‘timezone’ to database parameters.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code cleanup</p>

    <ul>
      <li>More debug log messages include socket info.</li>
      <li>Magic number removal and error message cleanup. (David Fetter)</li>
      <li>Wrapper struct for current pkt info.  Removes lot of compexity.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>
    <p>Fixes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Detect invalid pkt headers better.</li>
      <li>auth_file modification check was broken, which made pgbouncer
reload it too often.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>Several error/notice packets with send() blocking between

      <li>List search code for admin_users and stats_users
mishandled partial finds.  Fix it.</li>
