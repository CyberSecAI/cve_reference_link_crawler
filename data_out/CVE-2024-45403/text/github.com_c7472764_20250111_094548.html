# assertion failure when HTTP/3 requests are cancelled

Low

[kazuho](/kazuho)
published
GHSA-4xp5-3jhc-3m92
Oct 11, 2024

## Package

h2o
(C)

## Affected versions

commits between 16b13ee and 15ed15a

## Patched versions

commit 1ed32b2 and above

## Description

### Impact

When h2o is configured as a reverse proxy and HTTP/3 requests are cancelled by the client, h2o might crash due to an assertion failure.

The crash can be exploited by an attacker to mount a Denial-of-Service attack. By default, the h2o standalone server automatically restarts, minimizing the impact. However, HTTP requests that were served concurrently will still be disrupted.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been addressed in commit [1ed32b2](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/1ed32b23f999acf0c5029f09c8525f93eb1d354c). Users of h2o using h2o as a reverse proxy should upgrade to commit [95e8e17](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/95e8e178275acebb3a57d32a914723617fbe1724) or above.

### Workarounds

As an alternative to patching h2o, users may disable the use of HTTP/3 to mitigate the issue.

To disable HTTP/3, remove or comment out the [listen directives using the quic type or attribute](https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http3_directives.html).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
