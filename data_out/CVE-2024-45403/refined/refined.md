```
{
  "Root cause": "When h2o is configured as a reverse proxy and HTTP/3 requests are cancelled by the client, h2o might crash due to an assertion failure.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of cancelled HTTP/3 requests in reverse proxy mode leading to an assertion failure."
  ],
  "Impact": "A denial-of-service attack can be mounted by exploiting the crash, disrupting concurrently served HTTP requests. Although the h2o standalone server restarts automatically, the requests being processed are still disrupted.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker can cancel HTTP/3 requests to a vulnerable h2o instance acting as a reverse proxy."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/3 requests to the vulnerable h2o server and cancel them."
}
