| Security Advisory - [CVE-2021-44461](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44461) **Affects**: Odoo 13.0 to 15.0 (Enterprise Edition) **CVE ID**: [CVE-2021-44461](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44461) **Component**: Accounting (account\_accountant)  Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Accounting app of Odoo Enterprise 13.0 through 15.0, allows remote attackers who are able to control the contents of accounting journal entries to inject arbitrary web script in the browser of a victim. I. Background The Odoo accounting application allows external users to send invoices by email that are automatically imported into an Odoo database. II. Problem Description The content of the invoice was not properly sanitized. III. Impact **Attack Vector**: Network exploitable **Authentication**: None **CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.5 **CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)  A malicious user could send a crafted invoice and trigger injected web script code when an accountant opens the invoice.  Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild. IV. Workaround No workaround is available, updating to the latest revision or applying the corresponding patch is strongly recommended.  Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available. V. Solution Update to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it: <https://www.odoo.com/page/download> If updating is not an option, you may instead apply the patch corresponding to your Odoo installation (links provided below).  For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid for all versions: <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/setup/update.html> VI. Correction details The following list contains the patches that fix the vulnerability for each version:   * 13.0-ent: <https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/eb6799b56c0f4f55a91c59efc750abc6b9aa1436> * 14.0-ent: <https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/48f48647e3d9b61778450e430e889eb362d0e5d3> * 15.0-ent: <https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/commit/fce7a1a52e7e30e5adcdd61d49a512f27e08f73f> |
