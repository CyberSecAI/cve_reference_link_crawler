| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Device Manager and Adaptive Security Appliance Software Client-side Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm  First Published: 2022 June 22 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2022 August 17 12:48 GMT  Version 1.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwb05264](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05264)  [CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291)     CVE-2022-20829     CWE-345       CVSS Score: [Base 9.1](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20829     CWE-345       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm/csaf/cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the packaging of Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) images and the validation of those images by Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to upload an ASDM image that contains malicious code to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the authenticity of an ASDM image during its installation on a device that is running Cisco ASA Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted ASDM image on the device that is running Cisco ASA Software and then waiting for a targeted user to access that device using ASDM. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine of the targeted user with the privileges of that user on that machine.  **Notes:**    + To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative privileges on the device that is running Cisco ASA Software.   + Potential targets are limited to users who manage the same device that is running Cisco ASA Software using ASDM. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco devices if all of the following were true:    + The device was running a Cisco ASA Software release earlier than Release 9.8.4.45, earlier than Release 9.12.4.50, earlier than Release 9.14.4.14, earlier than Release 9.16.3.19, earlier than Release 9.17.1.13, or earlier than Release 9.18.2.   + The device was configured with a Cisco ASDM release earlier than Release 7.18.1.152.   + The Cisco ASDM image was using a Cisco ASDM-IDM Launcher release earlier than Release 1.9(5).   + The device was configured for HTTPS management access. For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the HTTPS Management Access Configuration To identify the status of HTTPS management access, use the **show running-config http** CLI command. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config http** command on a device that has HTTPS management access enabled on the *inside* interface:  ```   asa# show running-config http          http server enablehttp 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 inside   ```  The HTTPS management access is disabled if one of the following is true:    + The line starting with **http server enable** is missing.   + The output of the **show running-config http** command does not include an HTTP access control list (ACL) that is associated with an interface. If the output does include an HTTP ACL, the exact value of the ACL does not affect the vulnerability status of the device. However, potential targets are limited to users who connect to the HTTPS management server of the device from an IP address that is permitted by the HTTP ACL.  If the line starting with **http server enable** does not include a port, as in the example above, the default port 443 is used. The exact port value does not affect the vulnerability status of the device. Determine the ASDM Image Configuration To determine the configured ASDM image, use the **show running-config asdm | include image** CLI command. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config asdm | include image** command on a device that is configured to use the ASDM image named *asdm-7181.bin* on the *disk0:* filesystem:  ```   asa# show running-config asdm | include imageasdm image disk0:/asdm-7181.bin   ```  Empty output of this command indicates that no ASDM image is configured. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software   + Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.  **Notes:**    + Updating both Cisco ASA Software and Cisco ASDM Software is required to fully fix this vulnerability.   + After the ASDM image has been updated on a device that is running Cisco ASA Software, user machines that are running Cisco ASDM Software will automatically be updated with the new ASDM release when they first connect to the device.   + Once user machines have successfully updated, they will be running Cisco ASDM-IDM Launcher Release 1.9(5) or later. **Cisco ASA Software ([CSCwb05291](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb05291))**       | Cisco ASA Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- |   | 9.7 and earlier1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.8 | 9.8.4.45 (Sept 2022) |   | 9.91 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.101 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.12 | 9.12.4.50 |   | 9.131 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.14 | 9.14.4.14 |   | 9.151 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.16 | 9.16.3.19 |   | 9.17 | 9.17.1.13 |   | 9.18 | 9.18.2 |      1.
