# Rapid7 Discovered Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, ASDM, and FirePOWER Services Software

* Aug 11, 2022

Rapid7 discovered vulnerabilities and “non-security” issues affecting [Cisco Adaptive Security Software](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/adaptive-security-appliance-asa-software/series.html) (ASA), [Adaptive Security Device Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/adaptive-security-device-manager/index.html) (ASDM), and [FirePOWER Services Software for ASA](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286283326/type/286277393/release/6.2.3.18). Rapid7 initially reported the issues to Cisco in separate disclosures in February and March 2022. Rapid7 and Cisco continued discussing impact and resolution of the issues through August 2022. The following table lists the vulnerabilities and the last current status that we were able to verify ourselves.

For information on vulnerability checks in InsightVM and Nexpose, please see the `Rapid7 customers` section at the end of this blog.

| **Description** | **Identifier** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco ASDM binary packages are not signed. A malicious ASDM package can be installed on a Cisco ASA resulting in arbitrary code execution on any client system that connects to the ASA via ASDM. | [CVE-2022-20829](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-asdm-sig-NPKvwDjm) | Fixed |
| The Cisco ASDM client does not verify the server’s SSL certificate, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. | None | Not fixed |
| Cisco ASDM client sometimes logs credentials to a local log file. Cisco indicated this was a duplicate issue, although they updated CVE-2022-20651’s affected versions to include the version Rapid7 reported and issued a new release of ASDM (7.17.1.155) in June. | [CVE-2022-20651](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-logging-jnLOY422) | Fixed |
| Cisco ASDM client is affected by an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. The issue was originally reported by [Malcolm Lashley](https://gist.github.com/mlashley/7d2c16e91fe37c9ab3b2352615540025) and was disclosed without a fix by Cisco in July 2021. Cisco [reported](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw79912) this issue was fixed in ASDM 7.18.1.150, but Rapid7 has informed Cisco that the issue was in fact not fixed. Cisco retracted ASDM 7.18.1.150 and attempted to fix the issue 7.18.1.152. However, the issue remains exploitable as long as the user clicks through a pop up. Cisco is unlikely to further address this issue. | [CVE-2021-1585](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW)   [CSCvw79912](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw79912) | Not fixed |
| Cisco ASDM binary package contains an unsigned Windows installer. The ASDM client will prompt the user to execute the unsigned installer or users are expected to download the installer from the ASA and execute it. This is an interesting code execution mechanism to be used with CVE-2022-20829 or CVE-2021-1585. | [CSCwc21296](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc21296) | Fixed |
| Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services is vulnerable to an authenticated, remote command injection vulnerability. Using this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain root access to the FirePOWER module. | [CVE-2022-20828](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG) | Fixed in most maintained versions |
| Cisco FirePOWER module before 6.6.0 allowed a privileged Cisco ASA user to reset the FirePOWER module user’s password. A privileged Cisco ASA user could bypass the FirePOWER module login prompt to gain root access on the FirePOWER module. | [CSCvo79327](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo79327) | Fixed in most maintained versions |
| Cisco FirePOWER module boot images before 7.0.0 allow a privileged Cisco ASA user to obtain a root shell via command injection or hard-coded credentials. | [CSCvu90861](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu90861) | Fixed in boot images >= 7.0. Not fixed on ASA. |
| Cisco ASA with FirePOWER Services loads and executes arbitrary FirePOWER module boot images. The ASA does not restrict the use of old boot images or even the use of boot images that weren’t created by Cisco. This could result in code execution from a malicious boot image. | None | Not fixed |
| Some Cisco FirePOWER module boot images support the installation of unsigned FirePOWER installation packages. This could result in code execution from a malicious package. | None | Not fixed |

Rapid7 presented the vulnerabilities, exploits, and tools at [Black Hat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/briefings/schedule/index.html#do-not-trust-the-asa-trojans-27162) and [DEF CON](https://forum.defcon.org/node/241939) on August 11 and August 13, respectively.

## Product description

Cisco ASA Software is a “core operating system for the Cisco ASA Family.” Cisco ASA are widely deployed enterprise-class firewalls that also support VPN, IPS, and many other features.

Cisco ASDM is a graphical user interface for remote administration of appliances using Cisco ASA Software.

FirePOWER Services Software is a suite of software that supports the installation of the FirePOWER module on [Cisco ASA 5500-X with FirePOWER Services](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-firepower-services/index.html).

## Credit

This issue was discovered by [Jake Baines](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/author/jake-baines/) of Rapid7, and it is being disclosed in accordance with Rapid7's [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/).

## Analysis

Of all the reported issues, Rapid7 believes the following to be the most critical.

### CVE-2022-20829: ASDM binary package is not signed

The [Cisco ASDM binary package](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/279513399/type/280775064/release/7.17.1.155) is installed on the Cisco ASA. Administrators that use ASDM to manage their ASA download and install the Cisco ASDM Launcher on their Windows or macOS system. When the ASDM launcher connects to the ASA, it will download a large number of Java files from the ASA, load them into memory, and then pass execution to the downloaded Java.

![](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2022/08/image12.png)

The ASDM launcher installer, the Java class files, the ASDM web portal, and other files are all contained within the ASDM binary package distributed by Cisco. Rapid7 analyzed the format of the binary package and determined that it lacked any type of cryptographic signature to verify the package’s authenticity (see [CWE-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html)). We discovered that we could modify the contents of an ASDM package, update a hash in the package’s header, and successfully install the package on a Cisco ASA.

The result is that an attacker can craft an ASDM package that contains malicious installers, malicious web pages, and/or malicious Java. An example of exploitation using a malicious ASDM package goes like this: An administrator using the ASDM client connects to the ASA and downloads/executes attacker-provided Java. The attacker then has access to the administrator’s system (e.g. the attacker can send themselves a reverse shell). A similar attack was executed by [Slingshot APT](https://usa.kaspersky.com/blog/web-sas-2018-apt-announcement-2/14873/) against Mikrotik routers and the administrative tool Winbox.

The value of this vulnerability is high because the ASDM package is a distributable package. A malicious ASDM package might be installed on an ASA in a supply chain attack, installed by an insider, installed by a third-party vendor/administrator, or simply made available “for free” on the internet for administrators to discover themselves (downloading ASDM from Cisco requires a valid contract).

Rapid7 has published a tool, [the way](https://github.com/jbaines-r7/theway), that demonstrates extracting and rebuilding “valid” ASDM packages. The way can also generate ASDM packages with an embedded reverse shell. The following video demonstrates an administrative user triggering the reverse shell simply by connecting to the ASA.
