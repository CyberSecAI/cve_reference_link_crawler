The provided content relates to a fix for a kernel panic in the `e1000e` driver, specifically addressing an issue caused by the use of `usleep_range` within PHY access routines. This directly relates to CVE-2024-36887, as the vulnerability was a kernel panic due to incorrect usage of sleep functions in atomic context.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the usage of `usleep_range` within the PHY access routines of the `e1000e` network driver. These routines are sometimes called from an atomic context, where sleep functions like `usleep_range` are not allowed and lead to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability stems from using a sleeping function (`usleep_range`) in a context where it should not be used (atomic context). This violates kernel programming rules and leads to undefined behavior, resulting in a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic. This can cause a denial of service (DoS) to the system, as the system will crash and be unavailable until rebooted.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered when the PHY access routines are called from an atomic context. Specifically mentioned is cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems, which triggers PHY access in such a context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position. Triggering this vulnerability requires a specific action that involves ethernet cable management on systems that use the affected `e1000e` driver, such as disconnection/reconnection of an ethernet cable when used with vPro systems, which can also happen inadvertently.

**Additional details:**

The fix replaces `usleep_range` with `udelay`. `udelay` is safe to use in atomic contexts since it is a busy-wait delay function. This ensures that the PHY access routines no longer attempt to sleep in an atomic context.
The fix is a partial revert of a previous commit. This previous commit introduced `usleep_range` to workaround a sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems, which later introduced this kernel panic vulnerability.

The provided git logs show the fix being applied in multiple kernel versions, highlighting the wide range of systems vulnerable before the patch.
