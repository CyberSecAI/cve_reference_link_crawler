- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager WebUI accept user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and uses this link in a redirect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability. The application redirects users to a URL based on user-provided input without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to a malicious site, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other attacks. The listed impact is the ability to execute unauthorized code or commands but this is only a potential consequence of the redirection to an attacker controlled page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious redirect target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute the crafted URL to users. The user has to click on the crafted URL for the attack to be successful.
