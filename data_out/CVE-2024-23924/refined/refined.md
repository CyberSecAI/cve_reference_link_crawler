- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it in a system call within the `UPDM_wemCmdCreatSHA256Hash` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected Alpine Halo9 device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the Alpine Halo9 device. No authentication is required.
