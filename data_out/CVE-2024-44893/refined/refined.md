Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `JimuReportTokenInterceptor` which is used for permission checks. The vulnerability is caused due to a flawed logic in the permission bypass check, specifically in the `preHandle` method of the interceptor. It checks for the `previousPage` parameter and a `shareToken`. If a `shareToken` is provided, it queries the database to see if that share token exists, and if it does not, the permission check is bypassed, and the user will be granted access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass the permission check by providing a non-existent `shareToken`.
- **Flawed Logic:** The logic incorrectly assumes that if a `shareToken` doesn't exist in the database, it is safe to allow access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unauthenticated or unauthorized user can bypass the intended security restrictions and gain access to sensitive resources or functionalities by sending a request with a crafted `shareToken`. This enables access to protected endpoints like `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/dict/list`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request that includes the `previousPage` parameter and an arbitrary value for the `shareToken`. The `JmReport-Share-Token` header is also included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker should know to set a parameter and header in a request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `org.jeecg.modules.jmreport.config.firewall.interceptor.JimuReportTokenInterceptor` class.
- The `preHandle` method first extracts the `previousPage` parameter from the request.
- Then, the code checks if `shareToken` exists, it then attempts to extract the `JmReport-Share-Token` from the request header. This token is then used in a query to the database via the `this.jimuReportShareDao.getShareByShareToken` function.
- The key vulnerability arises when the database query returns no results, the `preHandle` function incorrectly returns `true` allowing access to restricted resources.
- The proof of concept exploit is to send a GET request to `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/dict/list?previousPage=1&shareToken=` with the header `JmReport-Share-Token:123`.

The vulnerability is fixed in a later version of JimuReport, as mentioned in the comments by user `jeecgos`.
