```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insecure concatenation of the 'query' GET parameter into an SQL query within the `/admin/convert/export_z3950.php` file, specifically in the `get_next_notice` function of the `/admin/convert/export.class.php` class.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection due to unsafe concatenation of user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database. Specifically, it allows extraction of session identifiers, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `/admin/convert/export_z3950.php` by manipulating the `query` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs no authentication and can send arbitrary HTTP requests to the server."
