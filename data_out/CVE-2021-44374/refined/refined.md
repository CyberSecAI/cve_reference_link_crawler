- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` process in Reolink RLC-410W IP cameras has multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities due to improper input validation in the JSON command parser. Specifically, the code assumes that the `param` value within a JSON command will always be a JSON object, but this is not enforced and can be an empty string. When a string is passed, the code attempts to use the subscription operator on a string which will cause an assertion failure leading to the termination of `cgiserver.cgi` and ultimately device reboot.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper input validation: The application does not validate the type of the JSON `param` value before parsing it.
    - Unhandled exception: The assertion failure within the JSON parsing logic is not handled, leading to process termination.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to denial of service, resulting in the reboot of the affected IP camera.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
    - The HTTP POST request body must contain a JSON array with a command having a `param` value that is not a JSON object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the vulnerable device.
    - Knowledge of the API endpoint and the command structure.
    - While most commands require authentication, these can be exploited unauthenticated using TALOS-2021-1420.
