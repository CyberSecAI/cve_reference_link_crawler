Product release information for VIPRE Antivirus Plus v12.0.1.203, released on May 30, 2023.

## What's New

[Download VIPRE Antivirus Plus](http://go.vipre.com/?linkid=1749)

As part of the release of VIPRE Antivirus Plus v12.0, we have ADDED the following new features:

* **AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI)**integration intercepts, scans, and potentially blocks any command line script interpreters such as Windows Command Prompt (cmd), PowerShell, etc
  + **To enable AMSI**, turn on Advanced Active Protection and select the checkbox next to Malicious Script Protection
* **Exploit Detection**detects exploitation attempts such as Heap Spraying, DLL Injection, Executable Stack, Process Hollowing, etc
  + **To enable Exploit Detection**, turn on Advanced Active Protection

We've UPDATED the following functions and features to protect you and your computer better:

* VIPRE AntiRootkit
* The 'Exclude from Scans' setting now applies to both manual and real-time scanning; it previously only applied to manual scans
* Real-time scanning handles when malicious threats are downloaded, even if Web Filter is turned off
* Malicious websites that start with HTTPS can now be detected by the Web Filter
* During the installation of VIPRE Antivirus Plus, VIPRE will now check which platform you are running
  + For example, if you use a 64-bit processor and a 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows, it will automatically download the appropriate executable file
* On 64-bit computers, the VIPRE Antivirus Plus installation folder is now C:\Program Files\VIPRE

The System Requirements have also been updated to remove support for Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 (Convenience Rollup). This has been replaced with Windows 7 Service Pack 1 ESU (Extended Security Updates) with May 2021 update. This is because Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7 in January 2020. Please note Windows 7 ESU is only available for those running Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Enterprise and have a partner support contract with Microsoft. You can learn more about Windows 7 ESU on [Microsoft's website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/windows-7-eos-faq/windows-7-extended-security-updates-faq).

We've REMOVED the following outdated features:

* VIPRE Search Guard was a toolbar for Internet Explorer that was removed from VIPRE due to the retirement of Internet Explorer
* The option to 'Scan files while they are opened or copied' under Advanced Active Protection, along with the option to manage file types, has been removed
* Cookies Custom Scan option has been removed
* Level of Advanced Active Protection (Performance or Most Secure) option has been removed
* ThreatNet has been removed
