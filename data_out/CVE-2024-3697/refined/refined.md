    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'id' parameter in the 'manage_tenant.php' file, which allows for SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the leakage of important user or system data, and compromise the security of the system.",

        "HTTP GET request to the 'manage_tenant.php' file with a crafted 'id' parameter in the URL."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication required as the vulnerability lies in the id parameter.",
    "additional_details": "The provided payload demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP(8)`, which could allow an attacker to extract data even without visible query results. The vulnerability is present in the 'manage_tenant.php' file and the vulnerable parameter is 'id'."
