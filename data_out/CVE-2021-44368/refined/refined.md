The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44368.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. Specifically, the `SetNetPort` API's JSON parameter parser assumes that the "param" JSON element is always a JSON object. However, the code does not validate this assumption. If a non-object value (like a string) is provided for the "param", the program attempts to access it as an object using the subscription operator, leading to an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The JSON parser does not validate the type of the "param" element, assuming it is always an object.
- Type confusion: The parser attempts to access a string as a JSON object.
- Denial of Service: The assertion failure in the code causes the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate, leading to a device reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Successful exploitation results in a device reboot, disrupting the camera's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing a JSON payload with the "SetNetPort" command and a non-object value for the "param" field to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- The request needs a session token, however this can be bypassed using a different vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420), allowing unauthenticated exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the camera's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint and the required JSON structure.
- Can be exploited without authentication when combined with TALOS-2021-1420.
