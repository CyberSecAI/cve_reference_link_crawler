The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1342.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A caching issue in Remote Desktop Manager that caused masked fields to sometimes stay revealed after closing and reopening a panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of masked fields, leading to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. The vulnerability is specifically caused by a caching issue, resulting in previously revealed fields remaining visible when they should be masked.

**Impact of exploitation:**  Sensitive information such as passwords could be unintentionally disclosed by the application.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical, as the user must have access to the machine and the application. The vulnerability requires user interaction, as it is triggered by closing and reopening a panel after revealing a masked field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to a machine with a vulnerable version of Remote Desktop Manager installed. They must have access to an account in Remote Desktop Manager which contains sensitive information. They would need to intentionally view the field, then close and reopen the panel.
