| Decoding a 0-height tiled TIFF image iterates over every horizontal pixel. A maliciously-crafted 0-height, max-width image can force 2^32 loop iterations and a substantial amount of CPU consumption.  Thanks to Philippe Antoine (Catena cyber) for reporting this issue.  This is [CVE-2023-29407](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3p8-6mrq-6g7h "CVE-2023-29407").   ---   This is a PRIVATE issue for [CVE-2023-29407](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3p8-6mrq-6g7h "CVE-2023-29407"), tracked in <http://b/279483698> and fixed by <http://tg/1944079>.  /cc @golang/security and @golang/release |
