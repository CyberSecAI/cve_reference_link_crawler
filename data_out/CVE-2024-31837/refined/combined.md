DMitry has multiple externally-controlled format string vulnerabilities and stack-based buffer overflows. The format string vulnerabilities are assigned [CVE-2024-31837](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9x99-qq28-ff9g "CVE-2024-31837"), and the buffer overflows appear to be related to [CVE-2017-7938](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-494m-pv6g-vh73 "CVE-2017-7938").

Format String reproducers:

Information disclosure:

`./dmitry -i "8.8.8.8 %p"`

Denial of service:

`./dmitry -i "8.8.8.8 %s %s %s"`

Buffer overflow reproducers:
