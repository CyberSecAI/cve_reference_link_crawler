Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the contact form update section of the admin panel of the Online Eyewear Shop Website. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it allows malicious scripts to be injected and stored in the database via the contact form update section. These scripts are then executed whenever the affected page is accessed by any user, including administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code to steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate users or administrators.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information from users, including personal data and login credentials.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator's session is hijacked, the attacker can gain full control over the website, including the ability to modify data, create new accounts, and potentially compromise the underlying server.
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to perform various malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Panel:** The attack vector is the contact form update section within the admin panel (`/admin/?page=system_info/contact_info`).
*   **Malicious Payload Injection:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into one of the form fields that is used to update the contact information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Online Eyewear Shop Website, which requires valid administrator credentials.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Form Field:** The attacker must know which specific form fields are vulnerable to the injection of JavaScript.
*   **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to inject a malicious JavaScript payload that can execute in the browser context when the affected page is accessed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Online Eyewear Shop Website".
*   The vulnerability is unpatched as of the provided information.
*   The provided proof-of-concept uses the `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` payload to demonstrate the vulnerability, indicating it is a basic XSS vulnerability. However, more sophisticated payloads could lead to more severe attacks.
*   The included images show the injection of the XSS payload into the contact form and the resulting execution.
