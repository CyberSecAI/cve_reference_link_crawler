- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an exposure of sensitive information through the ETag header in HTTP responses. This ETag reveals device version information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure (CWE-200), specifically the exposure of internal device version through the ETag header in HTTP responses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can fingerprint the FortiOS device version via HTTP requests by examining the ETag header. This information can be used to identify vulnerable devices for future attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated attackers can send HTTP requests to the FortiOS device and analyze the ETag response header to identify the device's version.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FortiOS device.
