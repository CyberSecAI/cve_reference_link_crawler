This is the Werkzeug 3.0.6 security fix release, which fixes security issues but does not otherwise change behavior and should not result in breaking changes.

PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/3.0.6/>

Changes: <https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/changes/#version-3-0-6>

* Fix how `max_form_memory_size` is applied when parsing large non-file fields. [GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2)
* `safe_join` catches certain paths on Windows that were not caught by `ntpath.isabs` on Python < 3.11. [GHSA-f9vj-2wh5-fj8j](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f9vj-2wh5-fj8j)
