{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The communication protocol of ConnectedIO devices includes a command that allows the management platform to specify arbitrary OS commands for devices to execute.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The presence of a command that enables arbitrary OS command execution from the management platform on the connected devices.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can issue OS commands to all connected devices, leading to arbitrary remote command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit the vulnerable command within the communication protocol of the affected devices.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the management platform to send malicious commands and needs to have knowledge of the device communication protocol."
