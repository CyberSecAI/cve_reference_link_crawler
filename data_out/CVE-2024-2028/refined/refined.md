### Summary:
The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Exclusive Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin, specifically within the Covid-19 Stats widget. The vulnerability allows authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher to inject malicious web scripts into pages.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the plugin's Covid-19 Stats widget.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the Covid-19 Stats widget on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape output before rendering it in the web page. This allows injected scripts to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they visit a page containing the vulnerable widget.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal a user's session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information from a userâ€™s browser.
*   **Website Defacement:** An attacker could alter the content of pages on the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious sites or attempt to install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the WordPress database via the vulnerable widget and executed when the page is rendered.
*   **Covid-19 Stats Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the Covid-19 Stats widget of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor or Higher Role:** The attacker needs at least Contributor-level access to add or modify content.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Widget:** The attacker must know that the Covid-19 Stats widget is vulnerable and how to inject malicious code through it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Exclusive Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including version 2.6.9.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.6.9.1.
*   The provided content includes code diffs that show the specific changes made to address the vulnerability, including the addition of input sanitization and output escaping functions. Specifically, the fix involves using `esc_attr` or `esc_url` to properly sanitize/escape data before outputting HTML.
*   The vulnerable code was not only in the Covid-19 stats widget, but other locations such as Animated Text, Call to Action, Card, Countdown Timer, Image Hover Effect, List Group, Logo Box, Pricing Table, and Testimonial widgets. These were all addressed in this changeset.
