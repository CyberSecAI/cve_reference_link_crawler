- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ZTE ZXUN-ePDG product uses a set of non-unique cryptographic keys by default when establishing a secure connection (IKE) with mobile devices over the internet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of non-unique cryptographic keys for IKE connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If the non-unique keys are leaked or cracked, user session information using those keys may be leaked.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting IKE connections between mobile devices and the ZXUN-ePDG.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be able to obtain the non-unique keys by either leaking them or cracking them.
