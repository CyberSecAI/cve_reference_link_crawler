- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the OAS Engine leaking the first 0x11 bytes of a file in the error message when the file does not conform to the expected configuration format during a configuration loading process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209). The application discloses the beginning of a file when it fails to load it, which can expose sensitive information if a carefully crafted file is chosen.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information contained within the leaked bytes of the file. This may include partial passwords, encryption keys, or other confidential data, depending on the file content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a series of network requests to the OAS Engine's configuration server to load a file using the configuration management tools, specifying a file that doesn't conform to the expected configuration format.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated application user of the OAS Engine and have network access to send requests to the configuration server. They also need to have the knowledge of the protobuf structure and how to specify a file path.
