Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-27932:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the Stormshield SSL VPN Client for Windows, where an attacker with limited privileges on an already compromised system can exploit a weakness to escalate their privileges to that of the service running the SSL VPN Client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the SSL VPN client.  The specifics of the vulnerability are not detailed, but it allows an attacker with low privileges to gain higher privileges associated with the Stormshield SSL VPN Client service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This can lead to:
*   Full control of the system.
*   Data breaches and exfiltration.
*   Installation of malware or backdoors.
*   Disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local:** The attack vector is local. This means the attacker must already have some level of access on the target system.
*   **Low Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploit does not require any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs low-level access to the target Windows system.
*   They need to be able to execute code on the system.
*   They need to target the vulnerable Stormshield SSL VPN client version
*   No user interaction is required after initial access.

**Affected Versions:**
* SSL VPN Client versions 2.1.0 to 3.0.0 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1.0 of the SSL VPN Client. Users are advised to update to this version.
*   There are no workarounds available.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 7.8
*   **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
*   **CVSS v3.1 Temporal Score:** 7.0
*   **CVSS v3.1 Temporal Vector:** AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
