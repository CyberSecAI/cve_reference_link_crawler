Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2015-20110:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `String.equals()` for comparing token signatures in the `TokenProvider` class. This method is susceptible to timing attacks because it short-circuits (breaks) the comparison process as soon as a character mismatch is found.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The `String.equals()` method's behavior allows an attacker to discern information about the correct signature by observing how long it takes for the comparison to fail. By sending many forged signatures with small variations, an attacker can deduce the correct signature character by character through subtle timing differences. This bypasses the need to brute-force the entire signature space which makes an attack feasible.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could forge valid tokens with arbitrary usernames, gaining unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By observing the timing of responses when validating tokens with forged signatures.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the authentication endpoint of the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to measure the time it takes for the response to come back (timing attack).

**Additional details:**
The fix implements a `constantTimeEquals` method, which iterates through the entire string during comparison regardless of if a difference is found. This prevents the timing attack because the time it takes for a comparison is now constant, regardless of the position of any differences. This is achieved by XORing all chars and checking if the accumulated XOR is 0.
```java
private boolean constantTimeEquals(String a, String b) {
    if (a.length() != b.length()) {
        return false;
    } else {
        int equal = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
            equal |= a.charAt(i) ^ b.charAt(i);
        }
        return equal == 0;
    }
}
```
