### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v2.22.0...v2.23.0`

| The TokenProvider uses `String.equals(str)` to compare the given token-signature with a calculated one. This method uses a break-on-inequality algorithm. This makes the TokenProvider vulnerable to timing attacks, where an attacker can forge a token with any username more easily than using brute force.  [Coda Hale did a nice blog post on this topic](http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/) |

| Impressive. I knew about them, and I didn't think we were vulnerable to them. I didn't write that code but I reviewed it quite carefully, and now you find this!! That's the great thing about JHipster, so many people working together.  Maybe we should also check for OAuth2, and for the standard Spring Security authentication mechanism. [@rwinch](https://github.com/rwinch) have you already checked this in Spring Security? |

| [@jdubois](https://github.com/jdubois) Thanks for calling this to my attention.  Spring Security / Spring Security OAuth either uses   * Constant time comparison (i.e. [PasswordEncoderUtils](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/4.0.2.RELEASE/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/authentication/encoding/PasswordEncoderUtils.java#L20) and [MacSigner](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth/blob/jwt1.0.1.RELEASE/spring-security-jwt/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/jwt/crypto/sign/MacSigner.java#L66)) or * java.security.Signature.verify (i.e. [RsaVerifyier](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth/blob/jwt1.0.1.RELEASE/spring-security-jwt/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/jwt/crypto/sign/RsaVerifier.java#L54)) which takes care of timing attacks as of [JDK 1.6u17](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/6u17-141447.html)   **UPDATE**  If any security vulnerabilities are found within Spring Security (or Spring in general). Then please report, to security@pivotal.io as outlined at <http://pivotal.io/security> or ensure to select the *Security Level* attribute with the value of *Assignee and Reporter* when reporting in JIRA. |

| I thought I knew Spring Security quite well, and now I see goes way beyond what I imagined!!  By the way I should check the JWT support from Spring Security: I didn't know about this, it's probably better than our own custom-made solution. |

| There are few examples if you want to use JWT. Migrating to JWT also solves websocket authentication issue as well. See the below examples for reference. <https://github.com/auth0/socketio-jwt> <https://github.com/nielsutrecht/jwt-angular-spring> |

| Oh, and if we migrate to JWT, then we might not have to merge this PR -> I'm putting this on hold, until we have a closer look at JWT |
