When creating a journal entry template in SAP S/4HANA (Manage Journal Entry Template) - versions S4CORE 104, 105, 106, 107, an attacker could intercept the save request and change the template, leading to an impact on confidentiality and integrity of the resource. Furthermore, a standard template could be deleted, hence making the resource temporarily unavailable.
