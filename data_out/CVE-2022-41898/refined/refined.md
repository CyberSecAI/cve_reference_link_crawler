{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation in TensorFlow crashes when provided with empty input tensors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code lacks proper handling for empty input tensors in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` leading to a crash."
    ],
    "impact": "A crash occurs in TensorFlow when `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` is called with empty inputs.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing empty input tensors to the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` operation.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to call `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` with empty inputs."
  },
  "remediation": "The vulnerability is fixed in TensorFlow versions 2.8.4, 2.9.3, 2.10.1, and 2.11.0. Users should upgrade to these versions or later to mitigate this issue."
