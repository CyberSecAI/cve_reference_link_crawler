{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `OFPHello` parser in `ryu/ofproto/ofproto_v1_3_parser.py` (and similar files in v1.4 and v1.5) does not properly handle a zero-length element in the hello message, leading to an infinite loop.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The parser iterates through elements within a hello message based on the provided length. If an element has a length of zero, the offset is not incremented, resulting in the same element being repeatedly parsed, causing an infinite loop.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can send a crafted hello message with a zero-length element, which will cause the controller to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malformed OpenFlow hello message to the controller.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the controller, specifically crafting an OpenFlow hello message."
