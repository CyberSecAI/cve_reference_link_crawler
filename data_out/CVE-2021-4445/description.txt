The Premium Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary Option Updates in versions up to, and including, 4.5.1. This is due to missing capability and nonce checks in the pa_dismiss_admin_notice AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated subscriber+ attackers to change arbitrary options with a restricted value of 1 on vulnerable WordPress sites.
