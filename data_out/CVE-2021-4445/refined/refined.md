Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-4445:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from `wpscan.com` and `www.wordfence.com` directly references "Premium Addons for Elementor < 4.5.2" (or <= 4.5.1) and describes a vulnerability related to arbitrary option updates, which matches with what is provided for CVE-2021-4445 by wordfence.com.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The primary cause is a **missing authorization and CSRF checks** in the `pa_dismiss_admin_notice` AJAX action within the Premium Addons for Elementor plugin. Additionally, there is a lack of validation of the option key, allowing for changes to arbitrary options and setting the value to '1'.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Missing Authorization:** The AJAX action does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.
    - **Missing CSRF Checks:** There is no protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, meaning a malicious user could trick an authenticated user into unintentionally triggering the vulnerable AJAX request.
    - **Arbitrary Option Update:** The lack of validation of the option key allows attackers to update any WordPress option, potentially causing significant changes to the site's functionality.
    - **Limited Value Input:** While the vulnerability allows for arbitrary option updates, the value of these options can only be set to ‘1’ which limits the control they have over settings.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker could:
        - Change the blogname and potentially other WordPress options (e.g., to render the blog unusable).
        - Enable user registrations (`users_can_register` option), allowing unauthorized users to create accounts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is via an AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action set to `pa_dismiss_admin_notice`.
    - The parameters for the AJAX call include the action and the ‘notice’ which is used as the option key to update.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber or higher.
    - The attacker does not need any special admin privileges.
    - They also need to know the structure of the vulnerable plugin to make the call, as well as the options available in order to change.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` highlights fixes in version 4.5.2, addressing the "equal height not working" and other unrelated issues, but does not speak to the vulnerability.
*   The `ithemes.com` content confirms the vulnerability, identifies the patched version (4.5.2), and states it as "Subscriber+ Arbitrary Blog Option Update".
*   The `wpscan.com` content provides a technical description of the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept of how to change the Blogname and the 'users_can_register' option using an AJAX request and a cookie for an authenticated user.
*   The `www.wordfence.com` entry labels the vulnerability as "Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited Arbitrary Option Update", again with references to the missing authorization/CSRF checks.

In summary, this vulnerability allows any authenticated user to change arbitrary options, including critical ones like enabling user registration on a website. The lack of CSRF protection makes exploitation easier, but the limited value input restricts the full extent of control the attacker can have over settings. The vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.2 of the plugin.
