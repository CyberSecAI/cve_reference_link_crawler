## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Premium Addons for Elementor < 4.5.2 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Blog Option Update

### Description

The plugin does not have any CSRF and authorisation checks in the pa\_dismiss\_admin\_notice AJAX action, available to any authenticated users, and do not validate the option key to ensure the option to update belongs to the plugin. As a result, any authenticated user, such as subscriber can update arbitrary WordPress options and set them to the value '1'. An attacker changing the users\_can\_register would enable users registration, other options could be changed to make the blog unusable as well.

### Proof of Concept

Change the Blogname to '1'
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
