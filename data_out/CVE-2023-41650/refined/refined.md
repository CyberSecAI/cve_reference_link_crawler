{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, will cause the vulnerable plugin to perform unintended actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request. This is typically achieved through social engineering or by injecting malicious code on a website the user visits."
