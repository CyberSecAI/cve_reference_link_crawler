A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of EdgeConnect SD-WAN Orchestrator could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack. A successful exploit allows an attacker to enumerate information about the internal
    structure of the EdgeConnect SD-WAN Orchestrator host leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information.
