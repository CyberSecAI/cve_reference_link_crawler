Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6870

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `rl_upload_image` AJAX endpoint of the Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts through file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input during file uploads, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the lack of sanitization on the `rl_upload_image` AJAX endpoint allows an attacker to upload a malicious 3gp2 file that contains malicious javascript code which is then executed when a user accesses the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of users accessing the affected pages. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions.
- **Website Compromise:** An attacker could potentially use XSS to escalate privileges, redirect users to malicious sites, steal session cookies, or perform other actions to compromise the website and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through a malicious file upload using the `rl_upload_image` AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with at least Author-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress admin interface to upload a malicious file via the AJAX endpoint.
