- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient authorization in the profile update request, allowing any user to inject the `user_data[api_key]` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper authorization checks when processing the `user_data[api_key]` parameter during profile updates. This allows users without the necessary privileges to create a valid API key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker (any user) can create a valid API key associated with their account. This allows them to bypass intended access restrictions and use the API, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or performing unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the profile update endpoint, including the `user_data[api_key]` parameter with an arbitrary API key value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (any user) of the CS-Cart MultiVendor platform.
