Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient input sanitization in the `/goform/delFileName` endpoint of the Tenda W30E router firmware. The `fileNameMit` parameter is passed to `strtok` and then directly to the `doSystemCmd` function without proper validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the `doSystemCmd` function through the `fileNameMit` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected device, with root privileges, potentially leading to:
    - Full control of the router
    - Data exfiltration
    - Installation of malicious software
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request to `/goform/delFileName`:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/delFileName` endpoint with the `fileNameMit` parameter containing malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router. This could be from the local network if the device is not exposed to the internet, or from the internet if port forwarding is enabled, or if the router is directly connected.
- **Authentication:** The provided PoC requires authentication to gain access to the affected URL. This implies that the attacker must authenticate with the router's credentials.
