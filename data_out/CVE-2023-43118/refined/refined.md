- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Chalet application has endpoints vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows a cross-domain request to force an authenticated user to perform actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability in the Chalet application. Specifically, the `/jsonrpc` API is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force an authenticated user, including admin users, to perform actions. Exploiting the `/jsonrpc` API allows for the execution of commands on the device, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** Cross-domain requests targeting vulnerable endpoints of the Chalet application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a malicious webpage) that triggers the CSRF attack. The user needs to be logged into the vulnerable Chalet application.
