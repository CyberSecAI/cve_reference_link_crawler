Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-47933:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to the resolution of a crash vulnerability related to IPFS functionality, specifically mentioned as "[hackerone] IPFS crash" and linked to issue #23646 in the `brave/brave-browser` repository. While the provided content does not include the original HackerOne report, it does reference the issue and the commit that addresses the reported crash. Although the CVE ID is not mentioned, the description aligns with a fix for a crash bug.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause was a lack of proper handling of IPFS requests when IPFS was disabled or when there was no browser context available. The code was attempting to handle IPFS requests even when the feature was disabled, leading to the crash. Specifically, the issue was related to "not proceeding loading ipfs resources if ipfs is disabled".

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing checks for IPFS enablement:** The code was not consistently checking if IPFS functionality was enabled before attempting to process IPFS requests.
- **Lack of browser context handling:** The code was not handling scenarios where a browser context was not available, leading to potential null pointer dereferences or other crashes.
- **Inconsistent handling of resource types:** The fix addresses that IPFS requests for subframes were not handled correctly when IPFS was disabled.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Browser crash:** Exploitation resulted in a browser crash, causing the user to lose their browsing session and any unsaved data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Loading IPFS resources:** The vulnerability is triggered when the browser attempts to load IPFS resources, particularly subframes, while IPFS is disabled.
- **Lack of context:** The code crashes when no browser context is available.
- **Specific resource type:** The issue was triggered when subframes with IPFS schema were requested, when IPFS was disabled.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to cause the browser to attempt to load an IPFS resource, specifically a subframe with IPFS schema when the IPFS functionality is disabled in the browser or without a browser context. This could be achieved through a malicious website or by injecting content into a legitimate website.

**Technical Details:**

The fix involved changes in `browser/net/ipfs_redirect_network_delegate_helper.cc` to:
- Add checks to ensure the presence of a browser context before attempting to handle IPFS requests.
- Verify if IPFS is enabled or disabled and block loading of IPFS resources if it is disabled.

The commit also added unit tests in `browser/net/ipfs_redirect_network_delegate_helper_unittest.cc` to verify:
- IPFS resource requests are blocked when IPFS is disabled.
- IPFS resource requests are blocked when there is no browser context.
- Subframe requests are blocked if IPFS is disabled.

The vulnerability fix was implemented in the `brave/brave-core` repository, as evidenced by the pull request [brave/brave-core#13989](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/13989) which addresses the issue.
The fix was then included in the `brave-browser` version 1.42.x release, as shown in the release notes.

In summary, the provided information details the resolution of a crash vulnerability in Brave Browser related to IPFS handling. The fix ensures that the browser does not crash when IPFS functionality is disabled, or when there is no browser context, thus addressing the identified weakness.
