**CVE-2022-31564** (and similar CVEs: 2022-31504, 2022-31505, 2022-31509, 2022-31510, 2022-31511, 2022-31512, 2022-31513, 2022-31514, 2022-31515, 2022-31516, 2022-31518, 2022-31520, 2022-31521, 2022-31526, 2022-31527, 2022-31528, 2022-31532, 2022-31533, 2022-31534, 2022-31535, 2022-31536, 2022-31537, 2022-31538, 2022-31540, 2022-31544, 2022-31545, 2022-31546, 2022-31547, 2022-31548, 2022-31551, 2022-31552, 2022-31553, 2022-31554, 2022-31555, 2022-31556, 2022-31557, 2022-31559, 2022-31560, 2022-31561, 2022-31562, 2022-31563, 2022-31564, 2022-31565, 2022-31566, 2022-31567, 2022-31568, 2022-31570, 2022-31571, 2022-31572, 2022-31574, 2022-31575, 2022-31576, 2022-31577, 2022-31578, 2022-31579, 2022-31582, 2022-31583, 2022-31585, 2022-31587, 2022-31588)

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause for all of these CVEs is the unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function in the respective repositories. Specifically, the `send_file` function was used with user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary vulnerability present is a **path traversal (CWE-22)**, also known as directory traversal. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths before passing them to the `send_file` function. This function will then access the files using an absolute path specified by user.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially access any file within the server's file system that the user running the application has access to. This could expose sensitive data such as application source code, configuration files, credentials, and system files.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is primarily through network requests, where an attacker sends a specially crafted request containing malicious file paths (e.g., containing `../` sequences or absolute paths) to the server. The vulnerable `send_file` function uses this input to construct the path for retrieving the file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or user interaction is needed for the exploitation as the vulnerability is in the parameters used by the function.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input (often a parameter in the URL) before using it in the `send_file` function.
*   The `os.path.join()` function, if used, also contributes to the path traversal because when it encounters an absolute path, it ignores the previously set paths.
*   The Flask's `send_file` function directly accesses files based on the given path and does not perform checks to ensure it does not go outside the defined path.
*   The common fix for this vulnerability is to replace `flask.send_file` function with `flask.send_from_directory` to ensure files are loaded from a secure, whitelisted directory or use `flask.safe_join` to sanitize the path input.

**Github Issue #669: Python: Flask Path Traversal Vulnerability**

This Github issue serves as a central point of discussion around path traversal vulnerabilities related to the unsafe use of `flask.send_file`. Key aspects from the comments in this issue can be summarized as follows:

*   A security researcher used CodeQL to discover numerous instances of this vulnerability in various Flask-based applications.
*   The researcher submitted patches to these projects, along with CVE requests.
*   There was a debate over the validity of the CVEs due to lack of active users and other factors.
*   The vulnerability arises from the use of `flask.send_file` with unvalidated user input.
*   Proposed fixes involve using `flask.safe_join` or `flask.send_from_directory`.
*   It was pointed out that some of these projects were not widely used and did not deserve CVEs (opinion).
*   Discussion was made on if these vulnerabilities were really "exploitable" for some projects because they were just code scraps
*   There was some controversy regarding if security researchers should have opened a public issue and PR rather than submitting a patch directly to maintainer.
*   A pull request was made to the OWASP dependency-check project to handle these vulnerabilities and avoid false positives ([jeremylong/DependencyCheck#4688](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/pull/4688)).
*   MITRE has stated that they are concerned with the amount of time required to debate CVE records for products that are not widely used.
*   GitHub Security Lab stated they do not encourage participants to request CVEs for small, academic or personal projects.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The information suggests a widespread issue with how developers handle file serving in Flask applications.
*   Automated tools like CodeQL can easily identify these issues, indicating the need for increased attention and developer education on secure file handling practices.
*   The discussion in GitHub issue #669 highlights the conflict between broad security vulnerability reporting and the actual impact of these vulnerabilities in different projects.
*   The `os.path.join` function when receiving absolute path should not be used.

In summary, CVE-2022-31564 and all the other CVEs are due to a pattern of insecurely using Flask's `send_file` function with untrusted inputs, allowing path traversal attacks. This issue was found on multiple public repositories with seemingly similar vulnerable patterns.
