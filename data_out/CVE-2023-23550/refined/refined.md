The content is related to CVE-2023-23550.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization of the username parameter in the `ys_thirdparty`'s `user_delete` function when calling the `check_system_user` function. Specifically, the `check_system_user` function uses `snprintf` to construct a command string that includes the user-provided username which is then executed using `popen`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS command injection (CWE-77): The user-supplied username is directly incorporated into a command string executed by `popen` without any sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: An attacker can inject malicious shell commands into the username field, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the device. This could result in full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
- Demonstrated impact: The provided exploit PoC shows that it can reboot the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted sequence of requests to the device via its telnet or ssh interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the router console via telnet or SSH.
- The attacker needs to have privilege to execute the `enable`, `configure terminal`, and `user_permission` commands. This implies the attacker requires administrative privileges.
