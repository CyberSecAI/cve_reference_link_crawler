Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in a regular expression used for email validation within the `nope-validator` library. This regex is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** The email validation regex has ambiguity and overlapping clauses which can lead to exponential backtracking. This means that for specific crafted input strings, the regex engine will take an extremely long time to process them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can provide a specially crafted email address string that forces the regex engine to perform excessive backtracking and consume excessive CPU resources. This can result in a denial of service for applications utilizing the vulnerable `nope-validator` library.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted email-like string as input to the email validation function of the `nope-validator` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over the input string that is being validated by the vulnerable regex. This could be an email address field in a web form, data provided via an API, or any scenario where user input is processed using the vulnerable library.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific email input string `name@[192.168.168.1:80\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a\a]`.
- The `emailRegex` regex used in `nope-validator` was identified as vulnerable via a CodeQL query.
- The vulnerability was reported to the maintainers of `nope-validator` by the GitHub Security Lab.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information includes examples of vulnerable regex and common ways of fixing them which can improve understanding of the vulnerability.
- The coordinated disclosure timeline indicates that the vulnerability was initially reported on November 30, 2020 and the public disclosure occurred on July 13, 2021, after the deadline for a fix had passed.
