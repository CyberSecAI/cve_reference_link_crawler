The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25774.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ConnectionAccept()` function of SoftEther VPN. Specifically, the shared `c->Cedar->lock` is contested by numerous threads spawned for each new TCP connection. This occurs because the code section after acquiring the lock takes longer to execute than the rate at which the `ListenerTCPMainLoop` spawns new threads, causing a buildup of threads waiting for the lock. This eventually leads to the server thread dying and being respawned, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400): The server spawns new threads for each incoming connection without properly managing the resource consumption, leading to excessive thread creation.
    - Shared lock contention: The `c->Cedar->lock` is a shared resource, and the contention for this lock leads to a bottleneck.

- **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial-of-service condition. The SoftEther VPN server becomes unresponsive, all existing VPN connections are terminated, and the server process restarts. Due to the speed at which the server can be repeatedly killed, the service becomes unusable. The service will restart as it runs as a service but can be continually killed.

- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this by sending a sequence of specially crafted network connections to any of the listening TCP ports (default ports: 443, 992, 1194, and 5555) of the SoftEther VPN server.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs network access to the target SoftEther VPN server.
    - The attacker needs the ability to initiate multiple TCP connections to the server.
