- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a vulnerable function that lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
