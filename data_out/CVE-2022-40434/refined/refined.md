{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application stores user-provided input (specifically the 'name' field from the account profile) without proper sanitization or encoding. This unsanitized input is then included in emails sent by the system, leading to HTML injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
       "HTML injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into emails sent by the application. This could be used for phishing attacks, injecting malicious scripts, or other forms of social engineering attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves submitting crafted HTML content in the 'name' field of a user's account profile. The injected HTML will be triggered when a password reset email is sent to the user.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a valid account on the application, and the ability to edit their profile details."
