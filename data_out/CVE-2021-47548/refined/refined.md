- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An array overflow vulnerability exists in the `hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port` function within the Hisilicon hns driver due to an incorrect bounds check. The code checks if `port` is greater than or equal to `DSAF_GE_NUM` (8) but uses `port` as an index into the `dsaf_dev->mac_cb` array which has a size of `DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM` (6). Thus, if the `port` value is 6 or 7 an array out-of-bounds read would occur.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Array out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially information disclosure by reading beyond the allocated memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port` function with a `port` value of 6 or 7.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have a way to call the vulnerable function with a crafted `port` value. This likely requires the attacker to have some control over the driver or kernel parameters.
