`* Security: Fixed XSS from post-meta shortcode in email campaign builder.`

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An XSS vulnerability existed within the email campaign builder due to the improper handling of the `post-meta` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the email campaign.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code via the post-meta shortcode.
- This malicious code could be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the crafted email.
- Depending on the injected code, this could lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of cookies or sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the email content
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to create a malicious post-meta shortcode and include it within an email campaign.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to create or modify email campaigns within the MailOptin plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have an account with privileges to create or modify email campaigns within the MailOptin plugin.
- The attacker would need to understand how to craft malicious shortcodes or use the `post-meta` shortcode to inject JavaScript.
