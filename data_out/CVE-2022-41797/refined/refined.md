Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Lemon8 app fails to properly restrict access permissions when handling Custom URL Schemes or Deep Links. This means the app does not properly validate the URLs it's instructed to access through these mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Restriction of Access Control (CWE-939):** The core issue is that the application does not properly restrict access to the function that handles custom URL schemes/DeepLinks, allowing it to be directed to arbitrary websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to redirect a user to an arbitrary website, potentially leading to phishing attacks. The user might be tricked into entering sensitive information on a malicious website disguised as a legitimate one.
*   **Arbitrary Website Access:** An attacker can force the app to open any website, which could be used for malicious purposes beyond just phishing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom URL Scheme/DeepLink:** The vulnerability is exploited through the app's handling of custom URL schemes or Deep Links. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when processed by the app, redirects the user to a site of the attacker's choosing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the local network. They can be a remote attacker that can craft malicious URLs.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The user must click or otherwise trigger the malicious URL through the vulnerable app.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both the Android and iOS versions of the Lemon8 app before version 3.3.5.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 4.3, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, indicating a moderate severity.
*   The vendor has released updated versions of the app (version 3.3.5 for both Android and iOS) to address this vulnerability.
* The provided content includes information about the app from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which are not directly related to the vulnerability but provide context about the app.
