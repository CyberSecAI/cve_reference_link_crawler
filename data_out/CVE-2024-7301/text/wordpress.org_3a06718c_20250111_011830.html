## FAQ

### Will the plugin work in a mobile browser?

Yes, the plugins will work in most mobile phones (has been tested in iOS, Android and Symbian browsers as well as Opera Mobile)

### Do I need to have Flash to use then plugin?

No, you do not need Flash to use the plugin.

### I get a SAFE MODE restriction error when I try to upload a file. Is there an alternative?

Your domain has probably turned SAFE MODE ON and you have restrictions uploading and accessing files. WordPress File Upload includes an alternative way to upload files, using FTP access. Simply add the attribute **accessmethod=”ftp”** inside the shortcode, together with FTP access information in **ftpinfo** attribute.

### Can I see the progress of the upload?

Yes, you can see the progress of the upload. During uploading a progress bar will appear showing progress info, however this functionality functions only in browsers supporting HTML5 upload progress bar.

### Can I upload many files at the same time?

Yes, but not in the free version. If you want to allow multiple file uploads, please consider the [Professional](http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/ "Wordpress File Upload support page") version.

### Where do files go after upload?

Files by default are uploaded inside wp-content directory of your WordPress website. To change it use attribute uploadpath.

### Can I see and download the uploaded files?

Administrators can view all uploaded files together with associated field data from the plugin’s Settings in Dashboard. The [Professional](http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/ "Wordpress File Upload support page") version of the plugin allows users to view their uploaded files, either from the Dashboard, or from a page or post.

### Are there filters to restrict uploaded content?

Yes, you can control allowed file size and file extensions by using the appropriate attribute (see Other Notes section).

### Are there any upload file size limitations?

Yes, there are file size limitations imposed by the web server or the host. If you want to upload very large files, please consider the [Professional](http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/ "Wordpress File Upload support page") version of the plugin, which surpasses size limitations.

### Who can upload files?

By default all users can upload files. You can define which user roles are allowed to upload files. Even guests can be allowed to upload files. If you want to allow only specific users to upload files, then please consider the [Professional](http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/ "Wordpress File Upload support page") version of the plugin.

### What security is used for uploading files?

The plugin is designed not to expose website sensitive information. It has been tested by experts and verified that protects against CSRF and XSS attacks. All parameters passing from server to client side are encoded and sanitized. For higher protection, like use of captcha, please consider the [Professional](http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/ "Wordpress File Upload support page") version of the plugin.

### What happens if connection is lost during a file upload?

In the free version the upload will fail. However in the Pro version the upload will resume and will continue until the file is fully uploaded. This is especially useful when uploading very large files.

### The plugin does not look nice with my theme. What can I do?

There is an option in plugin’s settings in Dashboard to relax the CSS rules, so that buttons and text boxes inherit the theme’s styles. If additional styling is required, this can be done using CSS. The Professional version of the plugin allows CSS rules to be embed in the shortcode.

Thank you very much for your great work! well done!
I have some issue with the plugin and It would be great if you help me with them as soon as possible.
first of all, I use the plugin inside Gravity form and I want the uploaded link could be saved with the form entry! I’ve tried different ways but didn’t come with the result! finally I just added the %pathfile% in the comment below when file successfully uploaded as a way to see the uploaded link but I want this path be saved some where with the form. but the link will disappears when we move to next page or next file upload!
secondly, in wordpress dashboard > uploaded files, it doesn’t show the file path with the domain name of ftp server but it shows the direct ftp address to the file which is not wanted!
thirdly, It would be great if the plugin asks the domain name and replace it with the ftp file address at the beginning of each file link.
lastly, it would be fantastic if the (uploaded files)’s links and names could be exported in an xlsx or csv file from wordpress dashboard > uploaded files.

The plugin is well-written and has a clean, logical interface. I am using it primarily for its webcam support, and it is working very well indeed.
There is a currently a problem with uploading the resulting video to Dropbox or Google Drive; however, that is caused by another plugin that has a dependency on an outdated version of Guzzle (an HTTP client).
Not only does the plugin work well, but Nickolas, the developer, delivers outstanding support.
Highly recommended!

This plugin is absolutely perfect and has everything one might need, especially in the pro version (awesome features that aren’t in the free version are listed there). If I was making a more serious website than I am currently working on, I’d definitely buy the pro version.
