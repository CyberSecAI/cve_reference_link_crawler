# CVE-2024-51060: SQL Injection in Projectworlds Online Admission System v1

## Description

Projectworlds Online Admission System v1 has an SQL injection vulnerability in the `index.php` login functionality. This flaw allows an attacker to inject specially crafted SQL queries into the `a_id` parameter, leading to potential code execution and information disclosure.

## Steps to Reproduce (PoC)

1. Capture the login request from the application using a proxy tool.
2. Inject malicious SQL queries into the `a_id` parameter or use automated tools for testing.

## Impact

Successful exploitation may allow unauthorized code execution or exposure of sensitive information.

## Credits

Discovered by Abhijith Narayanan, October 2024.
