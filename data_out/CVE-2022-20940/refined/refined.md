The provided content relates to CVE-2022-20940.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of countermeasures against a Bleichenbacher attack in the TLS handler of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. Specifically, the issue arises when a device uses SSL decryption policies with "Block with reset" configured for decryption errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper implementation of countermeasures against Bleichenbacher attack.
- Vulnerable devices act as an oracle.
- Susceptibility to chosen-ciphertext attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions to the affected device
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted TLS messages to an affected device.
- Remote network attack vector

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker
- Ability to craft TLS messages

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
- The vulnerability affects devices with at least one active SSL decryption policy configured to "Block with reset" for decryption errors.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to a software version that addresses the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

- Cisco confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products: Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, FMC Software, Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
