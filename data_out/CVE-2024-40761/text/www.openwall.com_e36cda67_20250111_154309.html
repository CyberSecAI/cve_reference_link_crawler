Subject: Re: CVE-2024-40761: Apache Answer: Avatar URL leaked
 user email addresses

Yes, but only through brute-force. The one-way property of MD5 is still
unbroken.

> The official recommendation is to use SHA256 instead.
This doesn't change a thing. You may as well brute-force SHA256 thus the
information leakage remains the same.

I'd recommend to switch to using HMAC (with SHA256 for good measure) as
a keyed pseudo-random function here. When the secret ist kept - well -
secret, negligible information about the user's email address is leaked.
Performing brute-force without knowledge of the secret key is also not
tractable.

Side note: This change does take away Gravatar's global property (i.e.
across multiple sites). I can't think of a straightforward way to
achieve global avatars without leaking any information about the user.
However, if the goal here is to have a simple avatar picture this should
be fine.
