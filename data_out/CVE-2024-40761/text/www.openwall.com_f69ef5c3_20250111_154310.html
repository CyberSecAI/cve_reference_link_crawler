 user email addresses

I think you are right. When I wrote my response yesterday I wasn't fully
aware how Gravatar is supposed to be used. I always thought of Gravatar
as a service to generate unique avatar images.

Now, this leaves me with a few observations:

 1. The 'should be taken' from Gravatar's documentation should be 'must
    be taken' to ensure consistent user hashes (therefore using MD5 in
    the first place rendered Gravatar useless if Gravatar doesn't match
    against MD5 hashes as well).
 2. The information leakage with Gravatar is in-spec. Fixing the
    information leakage would be possible but requires changes on
    Gravatar's side by implementing a symmetric cipher instead of a hash
    (as suggested; a hash wouldn't be tractable any more because
    Gravatar would need to hash every user's email address with every
    registered seed when using seeded PRF). Prior hashing wouldn't even
    be required given that both sides - Gravatar and the site itself -
    have access to the user's email address anyway.
 3. It may be advisable to not use Gravatar as the default (not sure if
    this is the case here). Instead, let user's choose it and let them
    know about the potential information leakage.
 4. The fix does not fix what it tries to fix.
 5. Assigning a CVE for an in-spec information leakage seems not useful
    to me. Otherwise, every single product using Gravatar would be
    affected by this.
