What is the specific property of SHA256 required here?  Email addresses
have low entropy and I suspect they can be easily brute-forced, so
leaking the SHA256 has is still bad.  Instead, I would use a seeded PRF
with a seed only known to the server, ensuring that the resulting value
does not leak any information about the email.
