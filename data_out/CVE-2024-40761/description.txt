Inadequate Encryption Strength vulnerability in Apache Answer.

This issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.3.5.

Using the MD5 value of a user's email to access Gravatar is insecure and can lead to the leakage of user email. The official recommendation is to use SHA256 instead.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.4.0, which fixes the issue.
