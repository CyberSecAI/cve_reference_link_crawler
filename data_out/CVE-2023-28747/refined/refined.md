**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a page containing a malicious form that triggers actions within the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to target a user who is already authenticated with the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious links or inject malicious code into a page that the victim is likely to visit.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity with a CVSS score of 5.4.
*   The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.4 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability falls under OWASP Top 10 category A5: Broken Access Control.
