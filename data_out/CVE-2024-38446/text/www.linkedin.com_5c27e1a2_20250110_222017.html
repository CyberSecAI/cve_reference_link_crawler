Written by: [Andy Olchawa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzejolchawa/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), [Milenko Starcik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milenko-starcik-b7960b198/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)

## Background

The Advisor Network ("ANET") is a platform designed to monitor the connections between advisors and their advisees. It was initially developed by the Defense Digital Service to aid the USFOR-A and Resolute Support missions in supporting the Afghan government by providing a structure for training, advising, and assisting. The
 [NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency)](https://be.linkedin.com/company/nato-communications-and-information-agency-nciagency-?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-mention)
  continues developing it, with the code available on [GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub%2Ecom%2FNCI-Agency%2Fanet&urlhash=2GJC&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block).

While ANET was created for a specific mission, its utility extends beyond its initial scope. Essentially, ANET tracks reports and associates them with their authors, organizations, and objectives, streamlining the management of relationships within and between entities.

## Vulnerability Assessment

As part of our ongoing review of open-source software in the aerospace and defence industry, we have done a vulnerability assessment that resulted in the following findings:

* CVE-2024-38447: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
* CVE-2024-38446: Incorrect Ownership Assignment

Both are forms of the [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger%2Enet%2Fweb-security%2Faccess-control%2Fidor&urlhash=m0yT&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) vulnerability.

## Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key

The ANET system allows users to create engagement reports. The reports require several different types of fields to be filled in; however, every report gets a unique ID. Additionally, a report can be in a different stage; in particular, a report can be saved as a draft (see Figure 1).

![]()

Figure 1: ANET report saved as a draft.

Figure 1 also shows that the author of the report is Erin. Reading the report details, we can access the ID of that object, in this case, 530b735e-1134-4daa-9e87-4491c888a4f7, as shown in Figure 2. Since Erin created this report and saved it as a draft, it should be visible only to her; namely, given that Erin hasn't published her report when logging in to the system as another user (e.g., username: Advisor), they can't see that report [MS1] (see Figure 3). However, if the user Advisor tries to access the report directly via the URL http://localhost:3000/reports/530b735e-1134-4daa-9e87-4491c888a4f7, they can now see Erin's report (see Figure 4).

### Recommendations

This vulnerability is a classic Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), and in this case, it is classified as [CWE-693 – Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcwe%2Emitre%2Eorg%2Fdata%2Fdefinitions%2F639%2Ehtml&urlhash=aYOi&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block). It is recommended that an additional check be added to verify that if the report is in the draft stage, it should be visible only to the author (or/and involved parties of a particular engagement).

## Incorrect Ownership Assignment

The ANET system allows users to create engagement reports. The reports require several different types of fields to be filled in. One of those fields is "Advisors". By default, this field is set to the report's author, and the system functionality prevents this field from being changed (see Figure 5). By editing and saving this report by Erin, we can intercept the GraphQL POST request with the report details using Burp Suite (see Figure 6). Reviewing the request, we can see that it contains Erin's UUID. At this point, we can replace this value with another user's UUID (in this case, the UUID of the user Advisor) and forward the request to the server. Figure 7 shows that the server accepted the request, and we received a 200 OK response. In the response from the server, we can also see that the author's UUID value has indeed been set to the user Advisor.

![]()

Figure 5: Error message with removing the author.

Going to Erin's dashboard, it's noticeable that the draft reports this user was the author of have disappeared (see Figure 8). However, when logging in to the system as an Advisor user, we can now see that this user has a new report (see Figure 9). To verify this is the same request, we compare the UUID we get from the browser with the one sent in the GraphQL request (see Figure 10).

Figure 10: Verification that it is the same report using its UUID.

### Recommendations

This is another example of IDOR vulnerability; however, in this case, we classified it as [CWE-708: Incorrect Ownership Assignment](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcwe%2Emitre%2Eorg%2Fdata%2Fdefinitions%2F708%2Ehtml&urlhash=gMuz&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block). It is recommended that the check done on the front end be extended to the back end of the ANET application.
