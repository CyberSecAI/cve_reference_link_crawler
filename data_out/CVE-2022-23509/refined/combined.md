Add HTTPS support to bucket server

```
The bucket server used by `gitops beta run` now serves over HTTP as
well as HTTPS. HTTP is still necessary as Flux's Bucket resource
doesn't have a field for providing a custom CA certificate.

This is a backwards-incompatible change as the ports the server is
listening on have to provided through flags. Also, providing TLS cert
and key is mandatory.
```

use HTTPS in `gitops run` S3 bucket server

```
When installing the dev bucket server on the cluster, it is now
configured with a self-signed certificate generated on demand. The
certificate is valid for 3 days which should be enough for a typical
`gitops run` use case.

Instead of using HTTP in the forwarding from the host machine into the
bucket server pod, the CLI now uses HTTPS so that traffic can't be
intercepted on its way between the developer's machine and the
cluster.

The certificate, after being generated, is put into a Kubernetes
Secret which is in turn mounted into the bucket server pod.

# Gitops Run insecure communication

High

[souleb](/souleb)
published
GHSA-89qm-wcmw-3mgg
Jan 9, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v0.11.0

## Patched versions

v0.12.0

## Description

### Impact

GitOps run has a local S3 bucket which it uses for synchronising files that are later applied against a Kubernetes cluster. The communication between GitOps Run and the local s3 bucket is not encrypted.

This allows privileged users or process to tap the local traffic to gain information permitting access to the s3 bucket. From that point, it would be possible to alter the bucket content, resulting in changes in the Kubernetes cluster's resources(e.g. [CVE-2022-23508](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wr3c-g326-486c "CVE-2022-23508")).

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed by commits [ce2bbff](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3106/commits/ce2bbff0a3609c33396050ed544a5a21f8d0797f) and [babd915](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/pull/3098/commits/babd91574b99b310b84aeec9f8f895bd18acb967). Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0 released on 08/12/2022.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

### References

Disclosed by Paulo Gomes, Senior Software Engineer, Weaveworks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
