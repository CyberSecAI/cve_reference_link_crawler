The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6443.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `utf8_trunc` function within `zephyr/lib/utils/utf8.c`. Specifically, when an empty string is passed to `utf8_trunc`, the `last_byte_p` pointer can point to one byte before the beginning of the string, leading to an out-of-bounds access in the subsequent code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The `utf8_trunc` function attempts to dereference `last_byte_p` without ensuring that it points to a valid memory location within the provided string.
- Lack of input validation: The `utf8_trunc` function assumes the input string is not empty, without a check to handle such cases.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial-of-service attacks due to the out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent, implying that the attacker needs to be within a network-adjacent location of the target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted Read Preset response with a PresetRecord name starting with a null character. The name length can be any non-zero value, which will trigger the vulnerability in the affected function.
