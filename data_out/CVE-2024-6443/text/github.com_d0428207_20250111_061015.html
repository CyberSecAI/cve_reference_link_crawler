# zephyr: out-of-bound read in utf8\_trunc

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-gg46-3rh2-v765
Oct 4, 2024

## Package

zephyr
(zephyr)

## Affected versions

<=3.6

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

In `utf8_trunc` in `zephyr/lib/utils/utf8.c`, `last_byte_p` can point to one byte before the string pointer if the string is empty.

### Details

First of all, I'm not sure whether this is a bug of library function or calling site's function.

The function `utf8_trunc` can be invoked by `utf8_lcpy`.

`utf8_lcpy` is called by multiple sites, and one example could be `handle_generic_update` in `zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/audio/has_client.c`.

There is no check for the input string, which could be empty string starting with null character, but `name_len` is larger than 0:

```
	pdu = net_buf_simple_pull_mem(buf, sizeof(*pdu));

	...

	name_len = buf->len + 1; /* + 1 byte for NULL terminator */
	if (name_len > ARRAY_SIZE(name)) {
		LOG_WRN("name is too long (%zu > %u)", buf->len, BT_HAS_PRESET_NAME_MAX);

		name_len = ARRAY_SIZE(name);
	}

	utf8_lcpy(name, pdu->name, name_len); // pdu->name could be null while name_len is not zero

```

When it goes into `utf8_lcpy`, it enters `utf8_trunc` since `n` is not 0:

```
char *utf8_lcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t n)
{
	if (n > 0) {
		strncpy(dst, src, n - 1);
		dst[n - 1] = '\0';

		if (n != 1) {
			utf8_trunc(dst);
		}
	}

	return dst;
}

```

This results in `last_byte_p` pointing to `utf8_str` - 1, because `utf8_trunc` seems to assume that `utf8_str` is not an empty string.

```
char *utf8_trunc(char *utf8_str)
{
	char *last_byte_p = utf8_str + strlen(utf8_str) - 1;
	uint8_t bytes_truncated;
	char seq_start_byte;

	if ((*last_byte_p & ASCII_CHAR) == *last_byte_p) {
		/* Not part of an UTF8 sequence, return */
		return utf8_str;
	}
	...

```

It directly leads to an out-of-bounds read in the subsequent code.

### PoC

Send Read Preset response with PresetRecord name starting with a null character.

The name length can be any value other than 0.

### Impact

Result of exploitation could lead to instability (i.e., crash) or denial of service attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
