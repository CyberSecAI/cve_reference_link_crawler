- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AppsAnywhere macOS client-privileged helper can be tricked into executing arbitrary commands with elevated permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege assignment in the macOS client's privileged helper component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can execute arbitrary commands with elevated permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user process can trick the privileged helper into executing arbitrary commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the macOS system.
