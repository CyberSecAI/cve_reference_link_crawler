**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Advanced Ads plugin's Ad widget.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**  Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
*   Malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim user.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Theft of session cookies and other sensitive data.
*   Website defacement.
*   Other XSS-related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present within the Advanced Ad widget.
*   Attackers inject malicious scripts via user-supplied attributes within the widget.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker must be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to utilize the Advanced Ad widget to inject malicious code.
