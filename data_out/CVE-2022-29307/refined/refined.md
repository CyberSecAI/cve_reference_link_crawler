The provided content relates to CVE-2022-29307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `copy_lang_content` method in the `application/models/lang_model.php` file of Ionize CMS. The `POST` parameter `from` is directly incorporated into the `create_function` function's content parameter without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code injection: The lack of input sanitization allows arbitrary code to be injected via the `from` POST parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server by injecting malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: A crafted POST request with a malicious payload in the `from` parameter is sent to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned in the provided content, which suggests that the vulnerability may be exploitable without authentication, although this requires further verification.
