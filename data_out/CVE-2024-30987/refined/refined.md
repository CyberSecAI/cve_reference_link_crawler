- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the "fromdate" and "todate" parameters within the "/bwdates-reports-ds.php" page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they access the affected page or interact with compromised data, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects a malicious script into the "fromdate" and "todate" parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable web application and modify the mentioned parameters.
