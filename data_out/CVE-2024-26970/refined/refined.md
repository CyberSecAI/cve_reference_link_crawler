{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The frequency table arrays in the `gcc-ipq6018.c` driver were not terminated with an empty element.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to missing null termination of frequency table arrays.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential out-of-bounds memory access when traversing frequency tables in functions like `qcom_find_freq()` or `qcom_find_freq_floor()`, possibly leading to a denial of service or information leak.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation would occur when the system attempts to access the frequency table using the vulnerable code paths.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to trigger the vulnerable clock frequency lookup functions which would require local access with the ability to interact with the clock subsystem."
