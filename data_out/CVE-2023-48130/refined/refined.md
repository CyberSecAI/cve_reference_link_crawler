Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The mini-app 'GINZA CAFE' exposes the channel access token in the client-side response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200): The channel access token, a critical credential, is exposed in the response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`. This token is intended to secure communication within Line and should be kept secret.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized access to the Line communication channel.
*   Attackers can use the leaked token to broadcast malicious messages to users of the GINZA CAFE mini-app. This could include:
    *   Malicious website links.
    *   Fraudulent information.
    *   Other unwanted content.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the Line mini-app 'GINZA CAFE'.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the mini-app.
*   The attacker intercepts or views the HTTP response of the request to `www.l-members.me/miniapp/members_card`, which contains the exposed token.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker only needs to have Line installed and be able to open the vulnerable mini-app 'GINZA CAFE'.
*   The attacker has to be able to view the network traffic when the mini-app makes requests (e.g., through browser developer tools or a proxy), or otherwise obtain the token as transmitted by the server.

**Additional notes:**

*   The content provides specific request URLs where the vulnerability can be observed.
*   It includes screenshots demonstrating the location of the leaked token and the intended usage of the token.
*   It explains the official definition and importance of keeping the channel access token secure.
*   The affected version is v13.6.1 of the GINZA CAFE mini-app.
