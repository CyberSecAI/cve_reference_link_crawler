LayUI is a native minimalist modular Web UI component library. Versions prior to 2.9.17 have a DOM Clobbering vulnerability that can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) on web pages where attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., `img` tags with unsanitized `name` attributes) are present. Version 2.9.17 fixes this issue.
