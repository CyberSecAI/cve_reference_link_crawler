# DOM Clobbering gadgets found in layui that leads to XSS

Moderate

published
GHSA-j827-6rgf-9629
Sep 26, 2024

## Package

npm

layui
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 2.9.17

## Patched versions

2.9.17

## Description

Hi, layui developer team!

### Summary

We have discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `layui` that can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) on web pages where attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., `img` tags with unsanitized `name` attributes) are present.

It's worth noting that we’ve identifed similar issues in other popular client-side libraries like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)) and Vite ([CVE-2024-45812](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-64vr-g452-qvp3)), which might serve as valuable references.

### Backgrounds

DOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code snippet) living in the existing libraries to transform it into executable code.

### Impact

This vulnerability can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) on websites that uses `layui` library and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags with improperly sanitized `name` or `id` attributes.

### Patch

This problem has been patched in Layui 2.9.17. You can find the official fix announcement at:

<https://layui.dev/notes/share/security-currentscript.html>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
