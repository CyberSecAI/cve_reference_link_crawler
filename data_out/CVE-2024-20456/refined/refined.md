- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error in the software build process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control in the boot process, allowing an attacker to bypass secure boot functionality. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to an error in the software build process that allows manipulation of system configuration options to bypass integrity checks during boot.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to control the boot configuration, bypass the requirement to run Cisco signed images, and alter the security properties of the running system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have *root-system* privileges on the affected device to manipulate the system's configuration options. They must be an authenticated local user with high privileges.
