{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-3759",
  "description": "It was discovered that the memory cgroup controller did not account for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects. A local user could use this for denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
  "affected_versions": [
    "linux-5.10"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The memory cgroup controller does not account for kernel memory allocated for IPC objects, specifically semaphores and sem_undo objects.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Missing accounting of kernel memory usage for IPC objects in memory cgroup controller."
  ],
  "impact": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by exhausting the available memory, leading to system crashes.",
  "attack_vector": "Local access",
  "attacker_capabilities": "A local user can exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly calling the semget function to create semaphores and sem_undo objects, thereby exhausting system memory.",
  "patches": [
    "The issue was fixed by adding accounting flags to semaphores and sem_undo allocation sites."
  ],
  "details": "A malicious user could take up more than 63GB of unaccounted memory under default sysctl settings by exploiting the unaccounted objects. This can be achieved by allocating 32,000 semaphore sets, each with 32,000 semaphore objects and one sem_undo object."
