Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the `username` parameter in the `index.php` file of the "Online Shopping Portal In PHP With Source Code" project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the user-provided `username` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on the database permissions and structure, an attacker might be able to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `username` parameter in the `index.php` file. By crafting a malicious payload within the `username`, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web application containing the malicious SQL payload in the `username` parameter.
*   No specific privilege is needed other than being able to access the web application.
