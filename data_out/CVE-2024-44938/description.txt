In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbDiscardAG

When searching for the next smaller log2 block, BLKSTOL2() returned 0,
causing shift exponent -1 to be negative.

This patch fixes the issue by exiting the loop directly when negative
shift is found.
