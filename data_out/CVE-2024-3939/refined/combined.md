## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ditty < 3.1.36 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ditty-new
2. In the menu on the right, click "Add Default"
3. Put the following payload in the Content Title field: "&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;
4. Click save and then reload to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
