### Description

The WatchTowerHQ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.10.1. This is due to the 'watchtower\_ota\_token' default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing in the 'Password\_Less\_Access::login' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in to the WatchTowerHQ client administrator user.
