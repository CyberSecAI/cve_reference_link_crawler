- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input in the `tab` parameter of the `serverMHospitality.asmx` function, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed in the context of a victim user's browser. This allows the attacker to steal cookies from authenticated users and potentially perform other malicious actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `tab` parameter and tricking a user into visiting it or by injecting the malicious payload through other vectors if available.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs to convince a user to trigger the injected payload, for example, by hovering the mouse over an element.
