Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that preloaded JSON data is not properly escaped when it is embedded within the HTML. This means that if an administrator enters text containing characters that conflict with HTML or JavaScript syntax, it can break the page's structure or cause JavaScript parsing errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Output Sanitization/Escaping:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-provided text before it's included in the HTML as part of preloaded JSON data.
*   **Injection Vulnerability:** Although the Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents direct script execution, the ability to inject arbitrary text that breaks JSON parsing or HTML structure is a form of injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. By injecting unescaped text into translatable fields, an administrator can cause the page to break, leading to an empty page and JavaScript console errors (e.g., "SyntaxError: Unterminated string in JSON").
*   **Page Disruption:** The injected content disrupts the intended rendering of the page, making it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Panel Input:** The attack vector is through the administrative interface, specifically the internationalization settings, where an admin or event admin can input arbitrary text into translatable fields.
*   **Data Injection:** The malicious data is inserted as user-defined text, which is then embedded within `<script>` tags as preloaded JSON, without proper encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** An attacker needs to have administrative privileges or event administrator privileges to access the system configuration and internationalization settings.
*   **Knowledge of Injection Point:** The attacker must know the specific fields that are vulnerable to this injection (e.g., "alfio.credits" in the provided example).

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The commit diffs highlight that the fix involves changing the way preloaded data is handled in `event.service.ts`, `i18n.service.ts`, `info.service.ts`, and `util.ts`. Specifically,  `JSON.parse(preloadEvent.textContent)` is replaced by `loadPreloaded('preload-event')` where `loadPreloaded` now calls `JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(preload.textContent))`. Additionally, in `IndexController.java` a fix was made by not adding raw content but instead encoding before placing it in a script tag.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by inserting `</script><script>` into the "alfio.credits" field.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix appears to focus on ensuring that preloaded data is parsed correctly, including decoding URL encoded text before parsing. The previous code was not encoding, and the data was placed directly into the HTML.
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `alfio/alf.io` up to and including `2.0-M4-2407` are affected. The patched version is `2.0-M5`.
*   **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is considered low because it can only be triggered by an administrator, and the Content Security Policy prevents script execution.

In summary, CVE-2024-45299 is due to a lack of proper escaping of preloaded JSON data, allowing an administrator to inject text that breaks the page functionality.
