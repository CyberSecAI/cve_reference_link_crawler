Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect authorization** within the `wpsp_display` function of the WP Show Posts plugin. Specifically, the plugin did not properly check user capabilities when querying for posts, leading to unauthorized access to posts with different statuses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The plugin was susceptible to exposing sensitive information by allowing authenticated users with contributor access or higher to view posts and pages with statuses like 'draft', 'trash', 'future', 'private', and 'pending', which they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with contributor-level access (or higher) could bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers could view potentially sensitive content meant to be private, such as unpublished drafts, private pages, or posts scheduled for the future.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `wpsp_display` function, potentially via a shortcode or direct function call, as the function is accessible to authenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in WP Show Posts plugin versions up to and including 1.1.4.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.1.5 by adding a user capability check.
*   The plugin's code retrieves post statuses based on user-defined settings, but before the fix it did not enforce proper permission checks allowing access to unauthorized post status.
*   The `post_status` argument in the query was not checked against the user's capabilities before running the query.
*   The fix ensures that if a user doesn't have the `read_private_posts` capability, then the query only looks for 'publish' posts.
