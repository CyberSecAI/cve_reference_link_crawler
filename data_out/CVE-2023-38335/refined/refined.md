Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an implementation flaw in Omnis Studio's handling of "always private" libraries. The software is designed to make this setting irreversible, but a specific check can be bypassed, allowing access to these libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Expected Behavior Violation (CWE-440):** The primary vulnerability is that the "always private" setting, intended to be irreversible, can be bypassed, leading to unexpected behavior. This violates the intended security design of the product.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Private Libraries:** An attacker can load and analyze "always private" Omnis libraries through the Omnis Studio browser, which is not intended by design.
*   **Analysis of Locked Classes:** By bypassing the privacy setting, the attacker can analyze locked classes within the private libraries.
*   **Potentially Sensitive Information Disclosure**: The ability to analyze "always private" libraries may lead to the disclosure of sensitive code or business logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Omnis Studio:** The attacker needs to access and use the Omnis Studio browser to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Bypassing Specific Check:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by bypassing a specific check in Omnis Studio when loading libraries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Omnis Studio:** The attacker must have access to the Omnis Studio development environment.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker must have some technical knowledge on how Omnis Studio works, as well as familiarity with the vulnerability.
*   **Execution of Custom Tool**: The attacker would likely need to execute the provided `OmnisUnlocker.exe` or a similar tool to achieve the bypass.

**Additional Information:**

*   A proof-of-concept tool, `OmnisUnlocker.exe`, has been created to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   A YouTube video demonstrating this exploit is also available.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but a solution is not yet available.
*   The risk level is considered low.
* The affected version is Omnis Studio 10.22.00
