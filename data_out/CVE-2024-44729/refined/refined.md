Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-44729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Missing access control allows arbitrary users to remove any participant from any meeting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The system lacks proper checks to ensure only authorized users (e.g., moderators) can remove participants.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who doesn't necessarily need to be part of the meeting, only a websocket connection to the server and knowledge of the peer ID of the victim.
*   **Reliance on Client-Side Information:** Peer IDs, necessary for the attack, are known to all meeting participants, including those who have been removed from the meeting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disruption of Meetings:** Attackers can arbitrarily remove participants, effectively ending or interrupting meetings.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly removing users, attackers can prevent meetings from taking place.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebSocket Connection:** An attacker needs a WebSocket connection to the server.
*   **Peer ID or Room ID Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know either the peer ID of the user to be removed or the room ID to remove all users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a WebSocket connection to the server.
*   **Knowledge of Peer IDs or Room IDs:** The attacker must know the peer ID of the targeted user, or the room ID to remove all users, which can be obtained by participating in the meeting at least once.
*   **Not required to be part of the meeting:** The attacker doesn't need to be an active participant in the meeting to exploit this vulnerability after having the necessary information.
