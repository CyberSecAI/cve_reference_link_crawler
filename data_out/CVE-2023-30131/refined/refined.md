{
  "CVE-2023-30131": {
    "root_cause": "The EasyInstall agent API on port 20051/tcp is unauthenticated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated API access"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can execute administrative management tasks such as: installing/removing software, generating pop-ups, terminating processes, changing admin passwords, and remotely wiping devices without any authentication.",
     "attack_vectors": [
         "Network access to the agent API on port 20051/tcp"
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable server/agent"
    ],
    "details": "The unauthenticated API allows for the execution of various administrative tasks, including the ability to remotely erase devices by using API function 36, terminate processes as SYSTEM (API function 37), change the admin password (API function 41), and run arbitrary commands using a callback mechanism to the EasyInstall server (API function 7). The unauthenticated access allows attackers to set server parameters and perform actions without any checks."
