Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of cookies without a specified domain in `Mojo::UserAgent::CookieJar`. According to RFC 6265, if a cookie lacks a `domain` attribute, the browser should assign the domain of the request-host and mark the cookie as "host-only".  However, Mojolicious was not setting the domain and using an `origin` attribute instead, which caused multiple cookies with the same name, domain and path, but different `origin` values, to be stored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Incorrect Cookie Domain Handling:** The `Mojo::UserAgent::CookieJar` did not properly set the cookie's domain to the request-host when no domain was provided, and was storing an `origin` parameter instead.
2.  **Duplicate Cookie Submission:** Due to the incorrect domain handling, multiple cookies with the same name, path, and (implicitly) domain could exist in the cookie jar. This resulted in multiple cookies being submitted to the server despite them having the same name and path, and belonging to the same domain. This deviates from the RFC and browser behavior.
3.  **Leaking Old Cookies:** The old cookies with a missing domain were not being removed and replaced by the new one, as they should have been according to RFC 6265. This resulted in old cookies "leaking" and being submitted with requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Security Risk**: The most concerning impact is the possibility of two cookies with identical parameters being submitted to the same site, which is not the intended behavior and may lead to security vulnerabilities. An attacker might be able to manipulate the cookies sent to a site or bypass security checks that rely on a single cookie having a specific value.
2.  **Inconsistent Cookie Behavior**: Applications using Mojolicious would behave inconsistently with web browsers because it allows duplicate cookies to exist in its cookie jar. This could lead to unexpected application behavior since the same cookie may be sent multiple times with different values for some systems.
3. **Cookie Jar Inconsistency:** Serialization and copying of the cookies are not possible, without copying the origin parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could exploit this by setting a cookie without a domain using `Mojo::UserAgent`, and then set another cookie with the same name and path, with a domain parameter.  The affected server would then receive two cookies, and the attacker could control the content of both cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the cookies that a Mojolicious application receives (directly or indirectly).
*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to a Mojolicious application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue was discovered by `expbbc` and subsequently fixed by `kraih`.
*   The fix involved removing the `origin` attribute and introducing a `host_only` attribute in `Mojo::Cookie::Response`, ensuring that the domain is properly set when missing from the cookie.
*   The fix also included a change in the cookie jar to correctly replace old cookies according to RFC 6265.
*   The vulnerability was deemed a "weak security issue" and was fixed quickly.
*   The fix can be found in commit `c16a56a9d6575ddc53d15e76d58f0ebcb0eeb149`.
*   The issue was also tracked in pull request #1192 "Only one identical cookie should be accepted per domain".
*   The fix was included in Mojolicious version 7.66
