- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ajax.php` script in the "Theme Volty CMS Payment Icon" module for PrestaShop has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed through a trivial HTTP request. The script failed to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `$pos` and `$value` variables, before using them in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (CWE-89) due to improper neutralization of SQL parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via HTTP requests to the `ajax.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker can perform the SQL injection remotely.
