The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47502.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of channel mapping lists in the `wcd934x` audio codec driver. Specifically, the driver was not checking if a channel was already added to a DAI (Digital Audio Interface) channel list before adding it again. This could lead to corruption of the list if the same channel was added to multiple lists. Similarly, when removing a channel from a list, the driver was not verifying its presence on the list, which could lead to issues if not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double insertion:** The code could add the same channel to multiple DAI channel lists, leading to list corruption.
- **Missing removal verification:** The code would attempt to remove channels without verifying their presence on the list.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **List corruption:** Incorrect channel mapping could corrupt the internal data structures of the driver.
- **Potential audio issues:** This corruption could manifest as audio routing issues, incorrect playback/capture, or other unexpected behavior in the audio subsystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Abuse of audio controls:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the audio controls, specifically the SLIM RX/TX mux settings, using amixer commands, or any other tool that interacts with the audio subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to manipulate audio controls.
- **Ability to interact with audio subsystem:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the audio subsystem, for example through amixer commands, or a specialized tool that can manipulate the audio driver's interface.
