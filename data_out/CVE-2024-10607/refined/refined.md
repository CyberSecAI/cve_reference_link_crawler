Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input verification for the "Consignment" parameter in the `track-result.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries because the input is not sanitized or validated before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert arbitrary SQL code into a query. The lack of input validation makes the application susceptible to this attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and directly access the database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Sensitive Information Access:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **System Control:** Exploiting the vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain more extensive control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** The attack can potentially disrupt the normal functioning of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `Consignment` parameter in the `track-result.php` file. This parameter is part of a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No login verification is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques, including:
  - **Boolean-based blind SQL injection:** Using `RLIKE` operator to infer the result of boolean conditions.
  - **Error-based SQL injection:** Using the `GTID_SUBSET` function to trigger database errors and extract information.
  - **Time-based blind SQL injection:** Using the `SLEEP` function to cause delays and infer the result of SQL queries based on the delay duration.
  - **UNION query SQL injection:** Using `UNION` queries to extract data from other database tables.

- The provided example HTTP request demonstrates a typical vulnerable request:
```
POST /track-result.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.200:1213
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
...
Consignment=123312&Submit=Track+now
```

- The GitHub issue provides example payloads for testing and exploiting this vulnerability.

**Remediation:**
The suggested repair includes:
1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
2. Input validation and filtering.
3. Minimize database user permissions.
4. Regular security audits.
