Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and improper input validation in the `api/file/multiDownload` API endpoint of ltcms. This endpoint allows an attacker to download files from a remote server and save them to the website directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The `api/file/multiDownload` endpoint does not require authentication, allowing any user to access it.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application uses `curl_exec()` to fetch content from a URL provided by the user via the `file` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, potentially leading to SSRF.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The content fetched from the attacker-controlled URL is saved to a location specified by the `savePath` parameter using `file_put_contents()`, enabling arbitrary file write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE by downloading a malicious PHP file from a remote server and saving it to a publicly accessible directory on the target server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/api/file/multiDownload` endpoint.
*   The attacker controls the `file` parameter to specify the malicious file to download and the `savePath` parameter to specify the location where the file is written.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ltcms server.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.

**Additional details:**
* The `file` parameter in the GET request specifies the URL of the file to download.
* The `savePath` parameter specifies the location where the downloaded file is saved.
* The vulnerability is located in the `File/multiDownload` controller, with the core logic in `app/utils/base/helper/Ltcms_download.php`.
* The vulnerability is triggered using the GET method and the parameters are passed as GET parameters, as shown in the provided POC.
