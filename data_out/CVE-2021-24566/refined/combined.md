# Severe Vulnerability Patched In WooCommerce Currency Switcher

Updated on July 23, 2021 - Marc Montpas

During an internal audit of [the woocommerce-currency-switcher plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-currency-switcher/), we uncovered a very severe local file inclusion vulnerability.

This security flaw could enable attackers to leak sensitive information like database credentials, cryptographic keys, and may allow arbitrary code execution in some instances.

We reported the vulnerabilities to the WOOCS team via email last week, and they released version 1.3.7 to fix this issue. If you are using an older version of this plugin, we encourage you to update immediately.

## **Details**

**Plugin Name:** WOOCS – WooCommerce Currency Switcher
**Plugin URI:**<https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-currency-switcher/>
**Author:** [PluginUs.net](https://pluginus.net/)

## **The Vulnerability**

Due to the seriousness of this vulnerability, and the number of affected sites, we will delay posting the proof of concept to give users time to upgrade.

### **Authenticated Local File Inclusion**

**Affected Versions:** < 1.3.7
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2021-24566
**CVSSv3.1:** [9.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
**CWE:**[CWE-98](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html)
**CWSS:** [96.5](https://www.cwss-score.info/#TI:C,1/AP:A,1/AL:NA,1/IC:NA,1.0/FC:T,1/RP:L,0.9/RL:NA,1/AV:I,1/AS:NA,1/IN:A,1/SC:A,1/BI:C,1/DI:NA,1/EX:H,1/EC:N,1/P:H,0.9/)

```

public function render_html($pagepath, $data = array()) {
    @extract($data);
    ob_start();
    include($pagepath);
    return ob_get_clean();
}

```

The *render\_html* method, which is used by the [woocs] shortcode to display the currency switcher on a page, does not correctly handle arguments sent to PHP’s extract function.

```

//[woocs]
    public function woocs_shortcode($args) {
        if (empty($args)) {
            $args = array();
        }

        $args['shortcode_params'] = $args;

        if (isset($args['sd']) AND intval($args['sd']) > 0) {
            wp_enqueue_style('woocs-sd-selectron23', WOOCS_LINK . 'css/sd/selectron23.css', [], WOOCS_VERSION);
            wp_enqueue_script('woocs-sd-selectron23', WOOCS_LINK . 'js/sd/selectron23.js', [], WOOCS_VERSION);
            wp_enqueue_script('woocs-sd-front', WOOCS_LINK . 'js/sd/front.js', ['woocs-sd-selectron23'], WOOCS_VERSION);

            if ($this->shop_is_cached) {
                wp_enqueue_script('woocs-sd-front-cache', WOOCS_LINK . 'js/sd/front-cache.js', ['woocs-sd-front'], WOOCS_VERSION);
            }

            global $WOOCS_SD;
            $args['sd_id'] = intval($args['sd']);
            $args['sd_settings'] = $WOOCS_SD->get(intval($args['sd']));
        }

        return $this->render_html(WOOCS_PATH . 'views/shortcodes/woocs.php', $args);
    }

```

Since $data contains all of the shortcode’s attributes, $pagepath can be overwritten with arbitrary file paths, which will then be included in the site’s execution context.

Since WordPress allows any logged-in users to render shortcodes, regardless if they have post-editing privileges or not, this is a pretty severe bug.

**Proof of concept**

To be released.
