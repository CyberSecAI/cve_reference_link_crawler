| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco SD-WAN Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sd-wan-priv-E6e8tEdF  First Published: 2022 September 28 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2022 September 29 21:59 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwa52793](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa52793)  [CSCwb54198](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb54198)     CVE-2022-20775 CVE-2022-20818     CWE-25 CWE-282       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2022-20775 CVE-2022-20818     CWE-25 CWE-282       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-priv-E6e8tEdF/csaf/cisco-sa-sd-wan-priv-E6e8tEdF.json)   Email      Summary  * Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges.  These vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on commands within the application CLI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by running a malicious command on the application CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-priv-E6e8tEdF>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco SD-WAN Software:    + SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers   + SD-WAN vManage Software   + SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.  **CVE-2022-20775**          | Cisco SD-WAN Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 18.4 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.2 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.6 | 20.6.3 |   | 20.7 | 20.7.2 |   | 20.8 | 20.8.1 |   | 20.9 | Not affected. |       **CVE-2022-20818**          | Cisco SD-WAN Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 18.4 and earlier | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.2 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.6 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.7 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.8 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.9 | Not affected. |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
