- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user-controlled data copied to stack buffers without size checks using unsafe functions like `strcpy` and `sprintf`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the usage of unsafe functions without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via command handlers and processing functions that handle user-controlled data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote network access. The vulnerabilities are exploitable without authentication, as indicated by `PR:N` (Privileges Required: None) in the CVSS vector.
