  "CVE-2023-41058": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2023-41058",
      "Description": "A Parse Pointer can be used to access internal Parse Server classes. It can also be used to circumvent the `beforeFind` query trigger which can be an additional vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify an incoming query."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to use a Parse Pointer to access internal Parse Server classes and circumvent the `beforeFind` query trigger.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Bypass of security mechanisms"
      ],
       "Impact": "An attacker could access internal Parse Server classes and bypass `beforeFind` query triggers, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.",
      "Attack Vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted Parse Pointer within a query.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a query with a malicious Parse Pointer. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
    },
     "Affected Versions": "1.0.0",
     "Patched Versions": "(>=5.5.5 <6.0.0) || (>=6.2.2)"
