# Parse Pointer allows to access internal Parse Server classes and circumvent `beforeFind` query trigger

High

[mtrezza](/mtrezza)
published
GHSA-fcv6-fg5r-jm9q
Sep 4, 2023

## Package

npm

parse-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

(>=5.5.5 <6.0.0) || (>=6.2.2)

## Description

### Impact

A Parse Pointer can be used to access internal Parse Server classes. It can also be used to circumvent the `beforeFind` query trigger which can be an additional vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify an incoming query.

### Patches

The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a patch in the internal query pipeline to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes or circumvent the `beforeFind` trigger.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround to prevent a Parse Pointer to be used to access internal Parse Server classes. A workaround if a `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer is to instead use the Parse Server provided [security layers](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security) to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
