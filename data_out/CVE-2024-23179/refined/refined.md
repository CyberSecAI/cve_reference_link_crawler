Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of the `parentheses` message when used in `GlobalBlocking::buildSubtitleLinks`. Specifically, the `::text` method was used without proper escaping. This message is used in the subtitle links within the GlobalBlocking special page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an i18n-XSS (Internationalization Cross-Site Scripting). This type of XSS occurs when user-controlled data within internationalized messages is not properly sanitized, leading to the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript through the `parentheses` message. If a user visits the vulnerable `Special:GlobalBlock` page, the injected script will execute in their browser, within the context of the site.
- **Possible consequences of arbitrary Javascript execution**: This could include stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the page content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Translation:** The attacker would need to inject malicious code within the translation of the `parentheses` message. This likely involves exploiting the i18n system used by MediaWiki to inject the payload.
- **Special Page Access:** The malicious script is then executed when a user visits the `Special:GlobalBlock` page, specifically when the subtitle links are generated.
- **`uselang=x-xss` parameter:** The `uselang=x-xss` parameter is used to trigger the vulnerability by injecting the malicious code via a specifically crafted language.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to modify translations:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify or contribute to translations within the MediaWiki environment, specifically modifying the translation for the `parentheses` message.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to visit the `Special:GlobalBlock` page to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a custom language code `x-xss` intended to find i18n XSS issues.
- The fix was implemented by properly escaping the output of the `parentheses` message in the affected code path.
- The fix was first applied in the MediaWiki 1.41.0 release, and backported to 1.35.14, 1.39.6 and 1.40.2
- This vulnerability is related to a larger issue of unsafe HTML in some MediaWiki messages (T2212)
- The fix includes marking `OutputPage::addSubtitle` as an XSS sink
