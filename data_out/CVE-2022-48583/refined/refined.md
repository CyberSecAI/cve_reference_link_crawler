- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ScienceLogic SL1 dashboard scheduler feature takes unsanitized user-controlled input and passes it directly to a shell command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands to the underlying operating system, leading to potential full compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the dashboard scheduler feature, and the user input is passed to a shell command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged user can exploit the vulnerability over the network.
