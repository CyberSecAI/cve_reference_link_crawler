  "0": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `lwp_ajax_register` function of the Login with phone number plugin where an empty check for the 'activation_code' was missing. The default value of the `activation_code` was an empty string, which allowed unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication Bypass",
       "Missing Empty Value Check"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker could log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user email.",
    "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by sending a request to the vulnerable endpoint without providing an activation code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the victim's email. No other special access or capabilities are required."

  "1": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The primary issue is a missing check for an empty activation code during the registration process, specifically within the lwp_ajax_register function. This allows bypassing the intended verification process.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication Bypass",
      "Missing Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to authentication bypass, potentially allowing unauthorized access to any user account if the email is known.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the lwp_ajax_register endpoint without an activation code, enabling an attacker to impersonate or access any user on the site.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only requires knowledge of the victim's email address to successfully carry out the attack. No special position or capabilities are necessary."
  },
  "2": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check for an empty value of `activation_code` in the `lwp_ajax_register` function. The default value of `activation_code` was set to an empty string which is not properly handled by a check. This permits an attacker with knowledge of an email on the affected site to bypass authentication.",
