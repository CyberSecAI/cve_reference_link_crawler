Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary Entry Deletion

**Root Cause:**
- Missing authorization checks in various AJAX actions within the Smart Forms plugin. This allows users with minimal privileges (like subscriber role) to execute privileged actions.
- Lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in some parts of the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control (OWASP A5):**  The plugin fails to properly restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles.
- **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** AJAX actions can be called by unauthorized users.
- **CSRF vulnerability:** Attackers can trick logged-in users into performing unwanted actions, such as deleting entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized deletion of entries. This can lead to data loss or manipulation, and potentially impact the functionality of forms using this plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct AJAX Call:** A low privileged user (subscriber) can directly call the vulnerable AJAX actions.
- **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage or link that forces a logged-in user to make the unauthorized AJAX calls (e.g., entry deletion).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the WordPress site, even a low-privileged subscriber account can be enough.
- For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a HTML form and Javascript to construct a POST request to `admin-ajax.php` with the vulnerable action `rednao_smart_form_delete_entries` and the IDs of the entries to be deleted.

**Affected Plugin:**
- Smart Forms plugin versions before 2.6.87.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.87 of the Smart Forms plugin.
