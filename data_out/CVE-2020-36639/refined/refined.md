The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36639.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `amx_votemap` command in the `adminvote.sma` plugin for AMX Mod X did not properly sanitize user-provided map names. Specifically, it did not restrict the use of the ".." sequence in the map name, which could lead to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation in the `amx_votemap` command.
- Directory traversal vulnerability due to the lack of filtering of ".." sequences in map names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- On Windows servers, this vulnerability allowed attackers to execute potentially dangerous console commands. It is implied, but not explicitly stated, that this could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious `amx_votemap` command with map names containing ".." sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to use the `amx_votemap` command, likely requiring admin privileges or the ability to trigger a vote.
- The target server must be running a vulnerable version of the AMX Mod X plugin on a Windows server.
