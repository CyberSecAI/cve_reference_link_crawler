Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `vc_saving_data` function of the Mega Addons plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The `vc_saving_data` function, responsible for saving plugin settings, lacks proper verification of user capabilities.
- **Insecure Data Handling:** The `vc_saving_data` function uses `sanitize_text_field` on the `$_REQUEST` data before updating the option, which is insufficient to prevent unauthorized modifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Settings Manipulation:** Authenticated users with subscriber-level permissions (or higher) can modify the plugin's settings, potentially disrupting site functionality or injecting malicious content. This includes enabling or disabling various plugin elements.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** By manipulating settings, an attacker might enable/disable components to facilitate further exploits or inject malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Authentication:** Requires an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- **Direct Access:** The attack targets the `wp_ajax_vc_save_data` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site with subscriber or higher level permissions.
- The attacker does not need any special administrator level privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `main.php` file of the plugin, specifically the `vc_saving_data` function (line 87).
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 4.3.0.
- There is no known patch available at this time.
