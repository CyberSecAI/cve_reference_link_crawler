### Description

The Mega Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the vc\_saving\_data function in versions up to, and including, 4.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to update the plugin's settings.
