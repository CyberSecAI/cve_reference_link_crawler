- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs when handling XML data provided to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DAP-1325 router.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XML data to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Authentication is not required.
