**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component, specifically within the firewall service configuration.

**Weakness/Vulnerability Present:**
- CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'). The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization or validation of input used to configure the firewall.
