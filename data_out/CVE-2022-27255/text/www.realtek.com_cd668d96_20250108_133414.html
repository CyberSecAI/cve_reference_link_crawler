Realtek AP-Router SDK Advisory

(CVE-2022-27255)

Release Date

2022/03/25

Affected Projects

Realtek AP-Router SDK

Affected Versions

rtl819x-eCos-v0.x Series

rtl819x-eCos-v1.x Series

CVE ID

CVE-2022-27255

Description

On Realtek eCos SDK-based routers, the ‘SIP ALG’ module is vulnerable to buffer overflow. The root
cause of the vulnerability is insufficient validation on the received buffer, and unsafe calls to strcpy. The
‘SIP ALG’ module calls strcpy to copy some contents of SIP packets to a predefined fixed buffer and
does not check the length of the copied contents.

A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability through a WAN interface by crafting arguments in SDP
data or the SIP header to make a specific SIP packet, and the successful exploitation would cause a crash
or achieve the remote code execution.
