## Commit

[Permalink](/vyperlang/vyper/commit/0b740280c1e3c5528a20d47b29831948ddcc6d83)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix: only allow valid identifiers to be nonreentrant keys ([#3605](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3605))

```
disallow invalid identifiers like `" "`, `"123abc"` from being keys for
non-reentrant locks.

this commit also refactors the `validate_identifiers` helper function to
be in the `ast/` subdirectory, and slightly improves the VyperException
constructor by allowing None (optional) annotations.
```
