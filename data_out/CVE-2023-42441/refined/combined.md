# incorrect re-entrancy lock when key is empty string

Moderate

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-3hg2-r75x-g69m
Sep 15, 2023

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=v0.2.9, <0.3.10

## Patched versions

0.3.10

## Description

### Impact

Locks of the type `@nonreentrant("")` or `@nonreentrant('')` do not produce reentrancy checks at runtime.

```
@nonreentrant("") # unprotected
@external
def bar():
    pass

@nonreentrant("lock") # protected
@external
def foo():
    pass
```
### Patches

Patched in [#3605](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3605)

### Workarounds

The lock name should be a non-empty string.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-42441

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

## Commit

[Permalink](/vyperlang/vyper/commit/0b740280c1e3c5528a20d47b29831948ddcc6d83)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix: only allow valid identifiers to be nonreentrant keys ([#3605](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3605))

[Browse files](/vyperlang/vyper/tree/0b740280c1e3c5528a20d47b29831948ddcc6d83)

```
disallow invalid identifiers like `" "`, `"123abc"` from being keys for
non-reentrant locks.

this commit also refactors the `validate_identifiers` helper function to
be in the `ast/` subdirectory, and slightly improves the VyperException
constructor by allowing None (optional) annotations.

disallow invalid identifiers like `" "`, `"123abc"` from being keys for non-reentrant locks.

this commit also refactors the `validate_identifiers` helper function to be in the `ast/` subdirectory, and slightly improves the VyperException constructor by allowing None (optional) annotations.

### What I did

So the rule is "first letter should be alphabet or `_` and remaining letter may be alphanumerical". Can we please add this to the docs [here](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/control-structures.html#re-entrancy-locks) what qualifies as a valid `<key>`.

it's the same as for all identifiers though. we could say "keys must be valid identifiers" but i think that might actually be more confusing than not.

well i just checked, and the identifier rules are not documented. they are basically a simplified version of the python2 identifier rules tho.
