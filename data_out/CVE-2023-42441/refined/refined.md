```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `@nonreentrant` decorator in Vyper did not properly enforce re-entrancy protection when an empty string was used as the lock key. This resulted in functions being unprotected from re-entrancy attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect re-entrancy lock",
    "Lack of input validation for the lock key in the `@nonreentrant` decorator"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A contract using `@nonreentrant(\"\")` or `@nonreentrant('')` would not have reentrancy protection, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Attackers could potentially call a vulnerable function recursively before the previous invocation finishes, which could lead to unexpected or malicious behavior, such as draining funds or manipulating contract state.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit the lack of re-entrancy protection by crafting a malicious contract that calls the vulnerable function on the target contract.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deploy and interact with smart contracts, and target a Vyper contract that uses the vulnerable `@nonreentrant` decorator with an empty string as a key."
