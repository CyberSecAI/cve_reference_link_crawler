Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-2949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of an uninitialized resource during the parsing of H3D files. Specifically, a DWORD value is extracted from an uninitialized buffer. This value, after sign extension, is used as an index into a stack variable to increment a counter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of Uninitialized Resource (CWE-908): The software uses data from an uninitialized memory buffer, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of specially crafted H3D files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious H3D file to the affected application (Altair HyperView Player).
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file (UI:R).
