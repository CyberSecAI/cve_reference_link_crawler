- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of validation of a key-value field in the Splunk-to-Splunk (S2S) protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the S2S protocol when processing key-value pairs. Specifically, the lack of validation can lead to a read buffer overflow (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) on Splunk Enterprise instances configured to index Universal Forwarder (UF) traffic. This DoS occurs because the malformed S2S request can crash the indexer.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending a malformed S2S request to a Splunk Enterprise instance configured to receive UF traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs network access to send the malformed S2S request to the affected Splunk Enterprise instance.
    - If Splunk forwarding is secured with TLS or a token, the attacker needs to compromise the certificate or token (or both) to exploit the vulnerability.
