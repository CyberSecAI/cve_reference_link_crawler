Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-2766:

**CVE-2018-2766**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is within the InnoDB storage engine used by MySQL and MariaDB, but the specific details are not provided in the given content. The vulnerability is described as "unspecified" in multiple sources.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as an "unspecified vulnerability" within the InnoDB storage engine. This means the exact flaw is not detailed. 
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to "unspecified" consequences, as described in the RHSA and Debian advisories. The RedHat advisory also indicates that this vulnerability could be exploited leading to an unauthorized read or modification of a subset or all MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.
*   **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the MySQL or MariaDB protocol over a network, but without the need for user interaction. The attack can be conducted locally or remotely (over a network) depending on the environment and exploit techniques. The RedHat advisory says this can be exploited remotely with low privileges.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the affected MySQL or MariaDB server instance. The attacker may or may not need user credentials depending on other vulnerabilities being exploited.  The RedHat advisory mentions that low privileges are enough to exploit remotely.
