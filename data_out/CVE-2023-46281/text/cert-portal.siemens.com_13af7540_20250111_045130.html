WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• CVE-2023-46281, CVE-2023-46282: Do not access links from untrusted sources
• CVE-2023-46283, CVE-2023-46284: If only one UMC server is used, block access to port 4002/tcp

e.g. with an external firewall

• CVE-2023-46284, CVE-2023-46285: If only one RT server is used, block access to port 4004/tcp
e.g. with an external firewall. If the deployment contains no RT-Servers, block the port in the local
firewall.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC IT Unified Architecture Foundation (SIT UAF) is a framework to build and run state-of-the-art
manufacturing operations management (MOM) applications.

Opcenter Quality is a quality management system (QMS) that enables organizations to safeguard
compliance, optimize quality, reduce defect and rework costs and achieve operational excellence by
increasing process stability. The integrated process capabilities (control charts, statistics, quality gates)
can detect production errors to avoid further processing and shipment of nonconforming material.

SIMATIC PCS neo is a distributed control system (DCS).

SINEC NMS is a new generation of the Network Management System (NMS) for the Digital Enterprise.
This system can be used to centrally monitor, manage, and configure networks.

SINUMERIK Integrate product suite facilitates simple networking of machine tools in the IT of the
production landscape.

Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) is a PC software that provides access to the complete
range of Siemens digitalized automation services, from digital planning and integrated engineering to
transparent operation.

User Management Component (UMC) is an integrating component that enables system-wide, central
maintenance of users.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46281

When accessing the UMC Web-UI from affected products, UMC uses an overly permissive CORS policy.
This could allow an attacker to trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS Vector
CWE

7.1
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46282

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected applications
that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The code could be potentially executed
later by another (possibly privileged) user.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46283

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when
handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the application. The
corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (’Classic Buffer
Overflow’)

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46284

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when
handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the
application. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (’Classic Buffer
Overflow’)

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46285

The affected application contains an improper input validation vulnerability that could allow an attacker
to bring the service into a Denial-of-Service state by sending a specifically crafted message to 4004/tcp.
The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash is detected by a watchdog.
