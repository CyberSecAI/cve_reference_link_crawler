WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2023-46281, CVE-2023-46282: Do not access links from untrusted sources
* CVE-2023-46283, CVE-2023-46284: If only one UMC server is used, block access to port 4002/tcp e.g. with an external firewall
* CVE-2023-46284, CVE-2023-46285: If only one RT server is used, block access to port 4004/tcp e.g. with an external firewall. If the deployment contains no RT-Servers, block the port in the local firewall.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46281

When accessing the UMC Web-UI from affected products, UMC uses an overly permissive CORS policy. This could allow an attacker to trick a legitimate user to trigger unwanted behavior.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.1 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46282

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected applications that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The code could be potentially executed later by another (possibly privileged) user.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.1 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46283

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the application. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46284

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer when handling specific requests on port 4002/tcp and 4004/tcp. This could allow an attacker to crash the application. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') |

Vulnerability CVE-2023-46285

The affected application contains an improper input validation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bring the service into a Denial-of-Service state by sending a specifically crafted message to 4004/tcp. The corresponding service is auto-restarted after the crash is detected by a watchdog.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.5 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-20: Improper Input Validation |
