# Potential mXSS vulnerability due to improper HTML escaping

Moderate

[shairez](/shairez)
published
GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4
Aug 6, 2024

## Package

npm

@builder.io/qwik
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.6.0

## Patched versions

1.7.3

## Description

### Summary

A potential mXSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to 1.6.0.

### Details

Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the following rules:

<https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/v1.5.5/packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208>

* If the string is an attribute value:
  + `"` -> `&quot;`
  + `&` -> `&amp;`
  + Other characters -> No conversion
* Otherwise:
  + `<` -> `&lt;`
  + `>` -> `&gt;`
  + `&` -> `&amp;`
  + Other characters -> No conversion

It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS).

## PoC

A vulnerable component:

```
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { useLocation } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

export default component$(() => {

  // user input
  const { url } = useLocation();
  const href = url.searchParams.get("href") ?? "https://example.com";

  return (
    <div>
      <noscript>
        <a href={href}>test</a>
      </noscript>
    </div>
  );
});
```

If a user accesses the following URL,

```
http://localhost:4173/?href=</noscript><script>alert(123)</script>

```

then, `alert(123)` will be executed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
