Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-6609:

**Root Cause:**
- When a system is nearly out of memory, an elliptic curve key that was never properly allocated could be freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management, specifically a double-free condition when memory allocation fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory corruption. While the severity is listed as "moderate," memory corruption could lead to a crash or potentially other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-memory scenario when dealing with elliptic curve keys. It's not explicitly stated how to force the out-of-memory condition but it's related to memory allocation/deallocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to find a way to trigger a situation within the application that leads to very low memory conditions, specifically related to elliptic curve key allocation.
