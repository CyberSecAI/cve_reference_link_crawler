Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper locking mechanism within the `mariabackup` component of MariaDB. Specifically, a mutex lock (`thd->ctrl_mutex` in `ds_compress.cc` and `stream_ctxt->mutex` in `ds_xbstream.cc`) is not released in certain error conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unreleased Mutex Lock:** When `pthread_create` fails in `create_worker_threads` function (MDEV-26561) or when `stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL` in `xbstream_open` function (MDEV-26574) the mutex lock acquired before the respective operations is not released, leading to a potential deadlock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The unreleased mutex locks can lead to a deadlock, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition, preventing the system from functioning correctly. The NetApp advisory states "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, as indicated by the CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H .

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerable code paths.
- **No User Interaction:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes references to two specific issues: MDEV-26561 and MDEV-26574 which both describe the same underlying problem (unreleased locks) in different files.
- The vulnerability affects MariaDB Server versions prior to 10.7.
- The fix involves ensuring that the mutex is released in error handling paths and was fixed in several versions including 10.2.42, 10.3.33, 10.4.23, 10.5.14, 10.6.6, and 10.7.2.
