### **[w1ldb1t](/w1ldb1t)** commented [Nov 25, 2023](#issue-2010700803)

| Vulnerability ReportSummary It is possible to cause a heap-buffer-overflow in CImg by passing a corrupted file as an input to the `load_analyze` function that is meant to process `ANALYZE7.5/NIFTI` files. Details The issue is present in the `_load_analyze` function, and it has to do with the fact that after reading the `header_size` variable, there is no check if its value is bigger than 4 bytes. Therefore, providing a `header_size` smaller than 4 bytes will make the first argument of `cimg::fread` point out of bounds of the `header` buffer, while it will subsequently underflow the second parameter (the size) passed to the function:  ```  CImg<T>& _load_analyze(std::FILE *const file, const char *const filename, float *const voxel_size=0) {       // ...       bool endian = false;       unsigned int header_size;       cimg::fread(&header_size,1,nfile_header); // <--- Read |header_size| from file       // ...       unsigned char *const header = new unsigned char[header_size];       cimg::fread(header + 4,header_size - 4,nfile_header); // <-- Heap buffer overflow       // ... } ```  Due to how `cimg::fread` is implemented this will write all the contents of the corrupted file out of bounds of the `header` buffer, enabling an attacker to control both the size and the contents of the overflow. Version Tested on CImg 3.3.2 Reproduction Simply call `load_analyze(..)` with the "corrupted" file attached in this issue as an input.

| This will indeed fix the underflow issue that causes the `cimg::fread` heap-buffer-overflow, but I don't think that this fix is enough, mainly because the root cause of this bug (a bogus `header_size`) can still cause a number of issues in the rest of the function.  To give you an example, a `header_size` that has the value of 5 (which will satisfy the suggested fix) will allocate successfully the `header` buffer with that size, but such a small buffer will then cause a series of access violations later down the road where the code will try to access it assuming that it's bigger than it actually is.  For example here:  ``` CImg<T>& _load_analyze(std::FILE *const file, const char *const filename, float *const voxel_size=0) {    // ...     if (endian) {       cimg::invert_endianness((short*)(header + 40),5); // <--- Out of bounds access       cimg::invert_endianness((short*)(header + 70),1); // ---       cimg::invert_endianness((short*)(header + 72),1); // ---       cimg::invert_endianness((float*)(header + 76),4); // ---       cimg::invert_endianness((float*)(header + 108),1); // ---       cimg::invert_endianness((float*)(header + 112),1); // ---     }     // ... }     ```  Or here:  ``` CImg<T>& _load_analyze(std::FILE *const file, const char *const filename, float *const voxel_size=0) {       // ...       if (nfile_header==nfile) {         const unsigned int vox_offset = (unsigned int)*(float*)(header + 108); // <--- Out of bounds access         std::fseek(nfile,vox_offset,SEEK_SET);       }       // ... } ```  ---   Since the code of `_load_analyze` seems to me that it accesses the `header` buffer at fixed offsets, one simple solution I believe is to increase the size of the check suggested above from 4 to the biggest offset used to access the `header` buffer.  Additionally, I believe that it's also crucial to check the return value of the `fread` that reads the header data from the file and writes it to the `header` buffer, and terminate/return if it's not equal to the `header_size`. That is because with the current function implementation, it's also possible to put a `header_size` bigger than the actual file size, which means that after `fread` reads the entirety of the file and puts it into the `header` buffer, it will leave the rest of the buffer uninitialized, essentially allowing `_load_analyze` to do all subsequent calculations based on uninitialized memory instead of user-defined data.  Let me know if you need any further clarification or reproduction cases/files. |

| According to <https://brainder.org/2012/09/23/the-nifti-file-format/>, the header size for Analyze and NIFTI files should be 348 bytes, so a more strict check may be possible (let say at least `header_size>128)`. At least CImg function `CImg<T>::save_analyze()` always output a 348 bytes header.  My proposal : [ec6a1f2](https://github.com/GreycLab/CImg/commit/ec6a1f2183620a90b4dcf456813e597ade791dc6)  Can you tell me if that seems ok ? |
