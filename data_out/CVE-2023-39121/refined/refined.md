{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of SQL queries during the import of SQL files in the emlog 2.1.9 system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into an SQL file and importing it through the system's backup/restore functionality. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially resulting in complete compromise of the system's database and the application itself.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves modifying a backup SQL file generated by the application, injecting malicious SQL code into it, and then importing this modified file back into the system through the 'Import SQL file' functionality in the administrator's panel.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the emlog 2.1.9 system to be able to access the backup and import functionality. The attacker must be able to modify the SQL backup file."
