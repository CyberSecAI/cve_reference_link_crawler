Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Exclusive Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin, specifically in the Call to Action widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering the Call to Action widget. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a webpage.
- **Compromise of User Data:** The injected script can potentially steal user session data, cookies, or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability resides in the "Exclusive Addons for Elementor" plugin.
- **Call To Action Widget:** The attack vector specifically involves the Call to Action widget within the plugin.
- **Input Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code into fields associated with the Call to Action widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least "contributor" level access.
- **Elementor Usage:** The attacker must be able to use the Elementor page builder to add or edit Call to Action widgets.

**Technical Details:**
The provided code diffs show several instances where user-supplied data is not properly escaped before being output to the HTML page. These include:
- `exad_section_cta_btn_effect` in `elements/call-to-action/call-to-action.php`
- `exad_card_badge` in `elements/card/card.php`
- `exad_section_countdown_show_box` in `elements/countdown-timer/countdown-timer.php`
- `exad_corona_enable_data_table_box` and `exad_corona_enable_data_table_heading_sticky` in `elements/covid-19-stats/covid-19-stats.php`
- `exad_ihe_effect` and `exad_ihe_hover_effect_2` in `elements/image-hover-effect/image-hover-effect.php`
- `exad_section_list_layout` and `exad_list_icon_position` and `exad_list_item_icon_box_enable` and `exad_list_icon_number_image` in `elements/list-group/list-group.php`
- `exad_section_logo_alignment` and `exad_logo_box_max_height_enable` in `elements/logo-box/logo-box.php`
- `exad_pricing_table_regular_price_cur` and `exad_pricing_table_regular_price` and `exad_pricing_table_price_subtitle` and `exad_pricing_table_note_text` and `exad_pricing_table_promo_title` in `elements/pricing-table/pricing-table.php`
- `exad_testimonial_layout` in `elements/testimonial/testimonial.php`

The fix implemented in changeset [3042217](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3042217/exclusive-addons-for-elementor) involves using functions such as `esc_attr()` and `esc_url()` to escape user-supplied data before outputting it in HTML. This prevents the browser from interpreting it as executable code, effectively mitigating the XSS vulnerability.

The javascript also has been updated in this changeset to validate the URLs that are used in the `data-exad-element-link` attribute, and prevent the redirection if the url is invalid by preventing the default behavior.

The version change in `exclusive-addons-elementor.php` from `2.6.9` to `2.6.9.1` and the changelog entry in `readme.txt` indicate that this patch addresses a security vulnerability.

The Wordfence article confirms this vulnerability as an authenticated Stored XSS via the Call To Action widget in the plugin with version 2.6.9 and earlier being vulnerable and 2.6.9.1 being patched.
