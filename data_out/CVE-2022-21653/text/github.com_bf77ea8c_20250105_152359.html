Scala's default `Map` is vulnerable to a DoS attack where an attacker basically fills up one leaf of the hash trie and causes resource exhaustion as more elements are added to the leaf with poor efficiency.

[scala/bug#11203](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11203)

`SimpleFacade` should be resistant to this as a "simple" implementation. Users can always implement their own `Facade` if they trust the input and need the performance edge.

Switching to `TreeMap` should solve this without any compatibility issues.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks!  Circe uses a [`LinkedHashMap`](https://github.com/circe/circe/blob/11068d8e9a1849a5f0e91adf60dabb57ae550edf/modules/jawn/shared/src/main/scala/io/circe/jawn/CirceSupportParser.scala#L69-L91), which I think we'd have to wrap as an `immutable.Map` in `finish`. So does [play-json](https://github.com/circe/circe/blob/11068d8e9a1849a5f0e91adf60dabb57ae550edf/modules/jawn/shared/src/main/scala/io/circe/jawn/CirceSupportParser.scala#L69-L91). Even a wrapped `java.util.HashMap` is sufficient, if we're not trying to optimize iteration of the underlying map. I strongly suspect this would be faster than building `TreeMap`s. You are of course correct that users can implement their own, but maybe we can avoid a performance regression using the Java types.  There's also a [`CollisionProofHashMap`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.6/scala/collection/mutable/CollisionProofHashMap.html). That may or may not be faster than the Java one, and could only work for Scala >= 2.13.  Seems like the mutable facade would also be vulnerable? |

| I haven't looked deep at the implementations for how Circe or Play do that wrapping. But I'd guess that they turn the java map into some non-map type (I vaguely remember play is a Seq of tuples or something?), or have expensive mutations (cloning the underlying mutable map each time), or do something like `scala.collection.JavaConverters` `.toScala.toMap`, which would convert to the default HAMT and expose the vuln ([I think Circe does on mutation](https://github.com/circe/circe/blob/e6685317bc9e6e65539bb6194900e0e754fbcb7c/modules/core/shared/src/main/scala/io/circe/JsonObject.scala#L295)). None of the above are ideal; for [my use case](https://github.com/kag0/ninny-json/blob/0.4.1/ninny/src/io/github/kag0/ninny/ast/package.scala#L54) at least. Users would find the map follows the contract, but wouldn't perform as one would assume. So at the end of the day we need a safe immutable map and `TreeMap` is the only one I'm aware of. Is there a way to more quickly build a different structure and then convert to `TreeMap`?  Unfortunately there's no immutable `CollisionProofHashMap`, so I think that leaves us in about the same situation as the java `java.util.HashMap` wrapped using `JavaConverters`. I think the ideal solution would be an immutable `CollisionProofHashMap` in the standard library (and added to collections compat), but short of that `TreeMap` seems like what we're left with.  Let me know if that all sounds correct |

> Is there a way to more quickly build a different structure and then convert to TreeMap?

As long as the building can't be observed externally, using a `TreeMap.newBuilder` and converting at the end would probably be faster.

But we should fix the vulnerabilities first, and we can improve the performance second.
