- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Short URL plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can craft a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, will perform unwanted actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing the malicious request. This can be achieved by sending the victim a link or embedding malicious code into a website. The attacker does not need any privilege within the application other than the ability to cause the victim to execute an action.
