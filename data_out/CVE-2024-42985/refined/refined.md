Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the `fromNatlimit` function of the Tenda FH1206 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the usage of `sprintf` to format a string where the size of the destination buffer `v4` is not checked against the user-provided `page` parameter from the POST request.
-  The `page` parameter is used in the following statement `sprintf(v4, "lan_controllist.asp?page=%s", v2);` without input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device. This can cause denial of service, device compromise, or potentially allow an attacker to perform other malicious actions on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/Natlimit` endpoint. The request must include a malicious `page` parameter with a length that exceeds the buffer size `v4`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, meaning they either need to be on the same network or have the ability to access it remotely, potentially through port forwarding or other means.
- No authentication seems to be required, making this easily exploitable for any network-connected attackers.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is specifically identified as FH1206 V02.03.01.35.
- A proof of concept (PoC) exploit script is provided using `requests` and `pwn` libraries that clearly shows how to trigger the stack overflow using a `page` parameter with 1000 'a' characters.
