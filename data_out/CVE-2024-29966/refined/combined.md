CVE-2024-29966

| **Brocade Security Advisory ID** | **BSA-2024-2569** |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | **hard-coded credential** |
|  |  |

**Summary**

Brocade SANnav OVA provides a Linux root account for use during the initial installation and management of the SANnav product. The default password for the root account is documented in the SANnav installation guide. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker full access to a Brocade SANnav OVA if the root password is not changed from default by the Admin after installing the SANnav product.

**Products Affected**

Brocade SANnav before v2.3.0a

**Solution**

Security update provided in Brocade v2.3.1, v2.3.0a and later releases will force the user to change the root password after first login.

**Credit**

Pierre Barre reported the issue to Brocade.
