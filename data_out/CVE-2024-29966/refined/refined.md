- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Brocade SANnav OVA has a default root password that is documented in the installation guide.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credential, specifically a default root password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker could gain full access to the Brocade SANnav OVA if the default root password isn't changed after installation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker could remotely access the system using the default root credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the SANnav OVA's network interface. No prior authentication is needed as the vulnerability lies with the default root password.
