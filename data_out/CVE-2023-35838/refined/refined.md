Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-35838:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided text from tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com explicitly mentions CVE-2023-35838 in the context of the "LocalNet attack":

> ### [LocalNet Attacks](#localnetdetails "CVE-2023-36672 and CVE-2023-35838")
>
> In the LocalNet attack, the adversary acts as a malicious Wi-Fi or Ethernet network, and tricks the victim into connecting to this network.

Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2023-35838.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how VPN clients handle routing exceptions, specifically the rule that traffic to and from the local network should bypass the VPN tunnel. This is intended to allow users to access local resources like printers while connected to the VPN.
*   **Weakness:** VPN clients incorrectly assume that all traffic routed to a local network address is actually local. Attackers can manipulate this by advertising a public IP range as local.
*   **Vulnerability:** An attacker-controlled Wi-Fi network can assign public IP addresses and subnets to connected devices. This tricks the VPN client into thinking that remote servers and websites are on the local network, causing the VPN to route the traffic outside the encrypted tunnel.
* **Impact of Exploitation**: The primary impact of this specific CVE is blocking of traffic.
    *   By advertising a large public IP range as local, an attacker can cause the VPN client to route traffic meant for the internet outside of the tunnel.
    *   Traffic blocked by this attack could include communications with security cameras, or other network devices, thus preventing users from receiving notifications.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is a malicious Wi-Fi network that can be controlled by the attacker. The attacker can also use a malicious Ethernet network.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by controlling the network to which the victim is connecting.

*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to create and control a Wi-Fi or Ethernet network.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
    *   The attacker does not need any information specific to the victim except that the victim connects to the attacker controlled network, and uses a vulnerable VPN client.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Specifics of CVE-2023-35838**: This CVE is specific to the LocalNet attack resulting in the blocking of traffic. A separate CVE (CVE-2023-36672) addresses the traffic leakage aspect of the LocalNet attack.
*   **Affected Devices**: The vulnerability is widespread, affecting various operating systems. iOS and macOS are very vulnerable. The text specifically states that VPN apps on Android are typically the most secure and that one quarter of VPN apps are vulnerable.
*  **Mitigation**: The primary mitigation against the LocalNet attack is to disable local network access in VPN clients. However, this feature is not offered by all clients. An ideal mitigation strategy is to force traffic to local IP addresses through the VPN tunnel instead of bypassing it.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-35838 is a vulnerability that allows an attacker in control of the network, to cause traffic to be blocked by tricking the VPN client into thinking that remote destinations are part of the local network. By doing this, the traffic will be routed outside the VPN tunnel and either be intercepted or blocked, thus bypassing the protection normally afforded by the VPN. The content provided here offers significantly more details than a typical CVE description, outlining the technical details of the attack, specific impacts, and mitigation strategies.
