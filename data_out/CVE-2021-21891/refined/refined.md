Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-21891

**Root Cause:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the `FsBrowseClean` functionality of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 Web Manager application (`ltrx_evo`). The vulnerability is caused by the use of `sprintf` with a fixed-size buffer and a user-controlled source, without any size validation, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** Two exploitable calls to `sprintf` exist within the function handling `FsBrowseClean`. Both are vulnerable because the `path` parameter, which is user-controlled, is copied into a fixed-size buffer on the stack using `sprintf` without any validation of its length.
*   The vulnerable code is triggered based on the `action` POST parameter being either `"deletedir"` or `"deletefile"`.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, corrupt the stack frame, and gain control of the program counter, resulting in remote code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overflows can cause crashes and potentially cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted authenticated HTTP request to the `/` endpoint, targeting the `FsBrowseClean` AJAX directive.
*   **POST Parameters:** The attacker must include the following POST parameters:
    *   `ajax=FsBrowseClean` to target the vulnerable functionality.
    *   `action` set to either `"deletedir"` or `"deletefile"` to trigger the specific vulnerable code paths
    *   `dir` with any non empty value
    *   `path` with a string large enough to overflow the fixed-size buffer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the web management interface of the Lantronix PremierWave 2050 device.
*   **`filesystem` Permission:** The authenticated user must have `filesystem` permissions to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Network Access:** Attacker requires network connectivity to the target device's web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
* The report provides assembly code snippets and a decompiled snippet of the vulnerable code, making it easier to understand the vulnerability's mechanics and locate the vulnerable `sprintf` calls.
*  The content provides specific exploit Proof of Concepts (PoCs) using `curl`, showing how to trigger the overflow with both `action` values.
*   The crash information provides register values from a crash caused by the buffer overflow, confirming successful exploitation.
*  The report mentions that there are two different overflows possible, depending on the "action" parameter value, and are tracked under the same Talos report ID (TALOS-2021-1334) as well as two different CVE IDs (CVE-2021-21890 and CVE-2021-21891).
