**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges to inject malicious code.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user to interact with the stored malicious payload

**Affected Product:**

*   Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
    *   AEM Cloud Service (CS)
    *  AEM 6.5.20 and earlier versions
