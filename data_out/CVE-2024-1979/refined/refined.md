Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-1979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `quarkus-kubernetes-deployment` extension in Quarkus automatically adds an annotation `app.quarkus.io/vcs-uri` to generated Kubernetes deployment descriptors. This annotation includes the Git repository URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** If the Git repository URL contains credentials (e.g., a token) for authentication, this information is included in the `app.quarkus.io/vcs-uri` annotation within the Kubernetes deployment descriptor. This descriptor might be exposed in a CI/CD artifact.
- **Credential Exposure:** The inclusion of the Git credentials in the descriptor, if exposed, could allow unauthorized access to the Git repository.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Git Repository Compromise:** An attacker who gains access to the Kubernetes descriptor containing the Git credentials could potentially access, modify, or compromise the source code repository.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Exposure of Kubernetes Deployment Descriptor:** The attacker would need to obtain the Kubernetes deployment descriptor. This could occur if the descriptor is published as a build artifact, stored in a public artifact repository, or otherwise exposed.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** The vulnerability is likely to be triggered within CI/CD pipelines where the repository is cloned using a URL containing credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the Kubernetes descriptor:** The attacker needs to gain access to the generated Kubernetes deployment descriptor to extract the Git URL with credentials.
- **No direct access to application code or server is needed**: This is a vulnerability in the build process.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue arises specifically when the Git repository URL contains sensitive data such as a Git token used for CI/CD authentication.
- The fix involves making the `app.quarkus.io/vcs-uri` annotation optional.
- The vulnerability is not a runtime issue but occurs during the build process.
- Red Hat has rated this as an "Important" security issue.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11.
