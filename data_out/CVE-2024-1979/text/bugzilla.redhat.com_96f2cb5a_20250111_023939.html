| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2266690#c0)  Nick Tait    2024-02-28 18:11:17 UTC  ``` The problem described at <https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/38055> has potential security impact.  Note that this is NOT a runtime CVE and that it will happen in very specific circumstances but it could lead to Git credentials leaking and thus your Git repository being at risk.  - If you are in an environment where you have a token in the Git URL of the Quarkus project you are building (which unfortunately sometimes happens on CI as it's the easiest way to authenticate) - if you build with an extension that generates a Kubernetes descriptor (e.g. Kubernetes or OpenShift extension) - if you publish the descriptor somehow (for instance as a build artifact attached to your CI build - for instance GitHub Actions artifacts)  Then there's a risk for your token to be leaked and your Git repository potentially compromised.  The fix is simple: <https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/38748/files>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2266690#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-03 10:53:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Quarkus 3.2.11  Via RHSA-2024:1662 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1662](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1662)   ``` |  |
