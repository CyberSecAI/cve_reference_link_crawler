# Directus version number disclosure

Moderate

[rijkvanzanten](/rijkvanzanten)
published
GHSA-5mhg-wv8w-p59j
Mar 1, 2024

## Package

npm

Directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=10.8.2

## Patched versions

10.8.3

## Description

### Impact

Currently the exact Directus version number is being shipped in compiled JS bundles which are accessible without authentication. With this information a malicious attacker can trivially look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version.

### Patches

The problem has been resolved in versions 10.8.3 and newer

### Workarounds

None

### Severity

Moderate

5.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-27296

### Weaknesses
