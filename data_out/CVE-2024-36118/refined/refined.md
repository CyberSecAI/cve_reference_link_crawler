- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient permission checks on functional test case access, allowing unauthorized users to view test cases from other workspaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization checks for viewing test cases, leading to an access control bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized viewing of functional test cases from different workspaces, potentially exposing sensitive testing details.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based access to the application's web interface, achieved by directly accessing a URL referencing a test case.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account on the application, but does not need to be a member of the workspace containing the test case they wish to view. They must also know or guess the URL of a specific test case. The attacker requires high privileges within the platform, which is likely related to being logged in. User interaction is required to access the URL.
