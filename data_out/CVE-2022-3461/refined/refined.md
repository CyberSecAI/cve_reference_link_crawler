- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of input data when parsing PC Worx or Config+ files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap buffer overflow (CWE-119)
    - Read access violation
    - Release of unallocated memory
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Compromise of availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (\*.bcp).
    - The attacker needs to manipulate data within the \*.bcp file.
    - The attacker needs to exchange the original file with the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Access to an original bus configuration file (\*.bcp).
    - Ability to manipulate the contents of the \*.bcp file.
    - Ability to replace the original \*.bcp file on the application programming workstation with the manipulated file.
