[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2022-048/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2022-048: PHOENIX%20CONTACT%3A%20Automationworx%20BCP%20File%20Parsing%20Vulnerabilities%20%28Update%20A%29)

#### ID

#### Published

2022-11-15 10:25 (CET)

#### Last update

#### Vendor(s)

PHOENIX CONTACT GmbH & Co. KG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - | Config+ | 1.0 <= 1.89 |
| - | PC Worx | 1.0 <= 1.89 |
| - | PC Worx Express | 1.0 <= 1.89 |

#### Summary

Manipulated PC Worx or Config+ files could lead to a heap buffer overflow, release of unallocated memory or a read access violation due to insufficient validation of input data.
The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (\*.bcp) to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation the attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.

**Update A, 2022-11-14**

* removed the sentence "*Automated systems in operation which were programmed with one of the above-mentioned products are not affected.*" from Impact.

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer[(CWE-119)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

**Summary**
*In PHOENIX CONTACT Automationworx Software Suite up to version 1.89 manipulated PC Worx or Config+ files could lead to a heap buffer overflow and a read access violation. Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities.*

[**CVE-2022-3737**](#cvedetails-CVE-2022-3737)

7.8

**Last Update**
Nov. 17, 2022, 11:18 a.m.

**Severity**
7.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

**Weakness**
Out-of-bounds Read[(CWE-125)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)

**Summary**
*In PHOENIX CONTACT Automationworx Software Suite up to version 1.89 memory can be read beyond the intended scope due to insufficient validation of input data. Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities.*

**Details**
[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3737)

#### Impact

Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

We strongly recommend customers to exchange project files only using secure file exchange services. Project files should not be exchanged via unencrypted email.

**Remediation**

With the next version of Automationworx Software Suite an already implemented remediation measure needs to be corrected to prevent the release of unallocated memory.
To prevent the read access violation the validation of the input data will be improved.

**We strongly recommend customers to upgrade to Automation Worx Software Suite > 1.89.**

#### Reported by

This vulnerability was discovered by Michael Heinzl.
We kindly appreciate the coordinated disclosure of this vulnerability by the finder.
PHOENIX CONTACT thanks CERT@VDE for the coordination and support with this publication.
