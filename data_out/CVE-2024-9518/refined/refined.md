- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient restrictions on the 'form_actions' and 'userplus_update_user_profile' functions within the UserPlus WordPress plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management. Specifically, the plugin allows unauthenticated users to set their user role via the `role` parameter during registration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can escalate their privileges to any role they choose (likely administrator if the vulnerable plugin is installed and active with default settings) by manipulating the registration process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted request to the plugin's registration handler by supplying a `role` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication and can be a remote, unprivileged user of the affected WordPress site.
