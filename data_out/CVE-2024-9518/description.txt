The UserPlus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.0 due to insufficient restriction on the 'form_actions' and 'userplus_update_user_profile' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to specify their user role by supplying the 'role' parameter during a registration.
