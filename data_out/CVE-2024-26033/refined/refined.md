- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts that are stored on the server and later executed by other users when they access the affected content. User interaction is required for the execution of the malicious script.
