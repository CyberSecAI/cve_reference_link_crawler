{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenFGA handles authorization models with rewritten tupleset relations, specifically when these relations involve anything other than a direct relationship ('as self').",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the authorization bypass due to the incorrect handling of rewritten tupleset relations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation leads to an authorization bypass, potentially allowing unauthorized access or actions within the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting authorization models that leverage rewritten tupleset relations, which don't adhere to the direct relationship constraint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to define or modify authorization models within OpenFGA and create models that involve rewritten tupleset relations that are not direct (as 'self') relationship."
