Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add` AJAX action within the WP Popup Builder plugin not properly validating input before passing it to the `do_shortcode` function. This allows the execution of arbitrary shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The core weakness is the ability for unauthenticated users to trigger the execution of arbitrary shortcodes. This is due to the lack of input sanitization and authorization checks before calling `do_shortcode`.
- **Improper Authorization:** The initial versions of the plugin only checked for the 'administrator' role, and later a nonce was added but did not fix the authorization issue. The fix involves checking for the 'manage_options' capability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary shortcodes, which can lead to various malicious activities. This could include:
    - Injecting malicious scripts into the website.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the server through vulnerabilities in executed shortcodes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests, specifically by sending AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoint `wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special User Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any user account on the target WordPress website.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX action (`wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add`) to target.

**Additional Details from Wordfence:**

- **Affected versions:** All versions of the WP Popup Builder plugin up to and including 1.3.5.
- **Patched version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.6, where the proper `manage_options` capability check was implemented in several AJAX functions.
- **Partial fix:** Version 1.3.5 introduced a nonce check which prevented direct access but didn't fully fix the authorization issue.
- **CVSS Score:** 7.3 (High)
- **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9061

**Summary of Changes in Version 1.3.6 (from the provided Trac logs):**
The changes in version 1.3.6 specifically address the authorization issue in `admin/ajax.php` and `admin/themehunk-menu/admin-menu.php`. The checks for `current_user_can('administrator')` were replaced with `current_user_can('manage_options')`, ensuring that only users with the necessary permissions can perform specific actions.

The key change is the replacement of administrator checks with `manage_options` checks in the following files and functions:
- `admin/ajax.php`: `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `option_update`, `lead_form_plugin_activate` and also in the shortcode handler.
- `admin/themehunk-menu/admin-menu.php`: the `themehunk_activeplugin` function.
