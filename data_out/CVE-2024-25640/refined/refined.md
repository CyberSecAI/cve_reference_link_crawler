- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of alternate XSS syntax. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in description fields, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application does not correctly sanitize or encode user-provided input, particularly in description inputs. This allows the attacker to store malicious scripts in the application's database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other related malicious activities. The attacker's scripts will execute when other users view the affected content.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. Attacker injects malicious script through a description field in the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit this vulnerability.
