{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses the uploaded file name without any sanitization or filtering in `CmsWebFileAdminController#upload` and `CmsFileUtils#upload` when creating the file on the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Upload"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/admin/cmsWebFile/doUpload` endpoint with a malicious file name and content within a multipart/form-data request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user, and needs to obtain a valid `_csrf` token and session cookie values."
