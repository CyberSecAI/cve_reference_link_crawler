{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The commit ab4750332dbe, which introduced begin/end_use ring callbacks for SDMA5.2, caused GFXOFF control to be used more frequently. This exposed a code path that was previously removed by commit 0dee72639533.  The re-emergence of this code path at suspend, specifically when using GNOME with a lockscreen trigger, leads to SDMA traffic and a potential system deadlock.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The removal of the gfxoff flush on suspend entry was premature.",
      "Increased usage of GFXOFF control due to SDMA5.2 changes exposed latent issues."
    ],
    "impact": "System deadlock during suspend.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Triggering a suspend while using GNOME and a lockscreen."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The user must have the ability to trigger a suspend using GNOME and have a lockscreen active which will cause SDMA traffic to be generated."
  },
  "remediation": "The commit reverts the changes introduced in 0dee72639533, re-introducing the flush of delayed gfxoff on suspend entry.  This avoids the race condition."
