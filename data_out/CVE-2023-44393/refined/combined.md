# Reflected XSS in /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin\_id=[here]

Critical

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<13.8.0

## Patched versions

14.0.0beta4

## Description

### Summary

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page, which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload.

### Details

The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL, the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed.

### Vulnerable code

Using the `&installstatus=ok` parameter I was able to trigger the function that insecurely injects the `plugin_id` value of the url into the HTML to render, so we can execute JS

[Piwigo/admin/plugins\_new.php](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/blob/c5b5dd0b8a804f64d92d9fd30144b5a7ff1cb8c7/admin/plugins_new.php#L44-L58)

|  | . '&amp;plugin=' . $\_GET['plugin\_id'] |

### PoC

Logged in as administrator, use the following code as the path to your hosted piwigo application

/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin\_id=nfez2%22%3E%3Cscript%3Eprompt(/SEQODE/)%3C%2fscript%3Ehkugi

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72779090/272966295-95862ca1-8ba8-48bf-83f9-788369a5005c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72779090/272966295-95862ca1-8ba8-48bf-83f9-788369a5005c.png)

### Impact

This is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the web page that is displayed to the victim. The malicious code can then be executed by the victim's browser, which can give the attacker control over the victim's account or even their entire computer.

This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However, only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page, which is only accessible to administrators.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
