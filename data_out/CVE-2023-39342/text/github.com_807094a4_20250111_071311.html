# Dangerzone CLI does not sanitize ANSI escape characters

Low

[eloquence](/eloquence)
published
GHSA-pvwq-6vpp-2632
Aug 8, 2023

## Package

dangerzone
(cross-platform desktop app)

## Affected versions

<0.4.2

## Patched versions

0.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The Dangerzone CLI (`dangerzone-cli` command) logs output from the container where the file sanitization takes place, to the user's terminal. If the container is compromised and can return attacker-controlled strings, then the attacker will be able to spoof messages in the user's terminal or change the window title.

Besides logging output from containers, it also logs the names of the files it sanitizes. If these files contain ANSI escape sequences, then the same issue applies.

Dangerzone is predominantly a GUI application, so this issue should leave most of our users unaffected. Nevertheless, we always suggest updating to the newest version.

### Patches

This issue will be fixed in Dangerzone 0.4.2.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
