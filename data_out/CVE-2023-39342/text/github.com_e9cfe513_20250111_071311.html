This release includes various new features, stability improvements, and security fixes. The highlights are:

* **An opt-in update notification mechanism for Windows and MacOS users**.

  This allows users to get notified for new updates when they open the Dangerzone application. For more info, we have [a page](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/wiki/Updates) where we explain this mechanism in detail.
* **Fix for security vulnerability [CVE-2023-39342](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/security/advisories/GHSA-pvwq-6vpp-2632)**

  This vulnerability affects the messages that users of the `dangerzone-cli` see in their terminal. This is a low severity CVE that does not lead to any integrity or confidentiality loss, but all users are encouraged to upgrade.
* **Alpha support for native sanitization on Qubes OS**

  Qubes OS users that can follow our build instructions can give Dangerzone a spin and use disposable VMs to sanitize their files, instead of containers. If you are an early tester, feel free to write about your experience in our [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/discussions).
* **4 contributions from 2 new contributors**, [@OctopusET](https://github.com/OctopusET) and [@keywordnew](https://github.com/keywordnew)

  We are especially excited for the support for HWP/HWPX files, which is a file format popular in South Korea, and unfortunately a common target of malware attacks (**note**: support for these files is not available on Qubes OS or MacOS with Apple Silicon chip yet).

For a full list of the changes, see our [changelog](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/blob/v0.4.2/CHANGELOG.md#dangerzone-042).
