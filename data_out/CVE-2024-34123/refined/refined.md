- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application loads resources from an untrusted search path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could place a crafted file in an untrusted directory that is searched by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the search path used by the application (e.g., by having write access to a folder searched by the application). User interaction is required (UI:R) for the exploit to be triggered, and the attack vector is local (AV:L). The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N). The attack scope is unchanged (S:U).
