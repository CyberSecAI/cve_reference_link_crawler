          "root_cause": "A maintainer can edit a pipeline schedule created by another maintainer without the original maintainer's knowledge.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Lack of ownership enforcement for scheduled CI pipeline edits."

           "attacker_capabilities": "Maintainer access to the GitLab project.",
           "additional_notes": "This vulnerability allows maintainer B to edit a scheduled CI pipeline that was created by maintainer A. The fix forces a maintainer to take ownership of the pipeline before editing. It was reported through HackerOne. The most severe vulnerability in the report of a maintainer being able to execute scheduled pipelines using another maintainer's CI_JOB_TOKEN was not in the scope of this particular fix."
