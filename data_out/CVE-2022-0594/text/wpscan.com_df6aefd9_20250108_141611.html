## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shareaholic < 9.7.6 - Information Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not have proper authorisation check in one of the AJAX action, available to unauthenticated (in v < 9.7.5) and author+ (in v9.7.5) users, allowing them to call it and retrieve various information such as the list of active plugins, various version like PHP, cURL, WP etc.

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=shareaholic\_debug\_info
In v < 9.7.5, unauthenticated users can access it, in 9.7.5 it's only available to author roles and above
