Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the "Coming Soon Maintenance Mode" WordPress plugin handles REST API requests when the site is in maintenance mode. The plugin attempts to restrict access to posts and pages via the REST API for unauthenticated users when maintenance mode is enabled. However, it fails to properly implement this restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control within the plugin's REST API handling. Despite having logic to restrict access during maintenance mode, unauthenticated users can still retrieve post and page content.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Due to the improper access control, sensitive information, specifically post and page content, is exposed to unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can bypass the intended protection of the maintenance mode and access content that is meant to be hidden from public view. This can include drafts, unpublished content, or other sensitive information that site owners wouldn't want exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API Endpoint Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the WordPress REST API endpoints for posts and pages, typically located at `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts` and `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely without any prior access.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the target WordPress site to send requests to its REST API endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.0.5.
*   The patch for this vulnerability is included in version 1.0.6 of the plugin.
*   The provided diff from the plugin's trac shows the addition of a filter 'rest\_pre\_dispatch' that checks for the maintenance mode and restricts access to the REST API posts/pages endpoints, which was not in previous versions.
