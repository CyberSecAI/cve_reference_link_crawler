Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with **CVE-2024-23899**:

**Root Cause:**
- The `Git server Plugin` utilizes the `args4j` library for parsing command arguments when processing Git commands received via SSH.
- The `args4j` library has a feature (`expandAtFiles`) that replaces an `@` character followed by a file path with the contents of that file.
- This feature is enabled by default and not disabled in vulnerable versions of the `Git server Plugin`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by providing a path to the file within a command sent via SSH.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can read the first two lines of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system using the default character encoding of the Jenkins controller process.
- The ability to read arbitrary files can lead to the exposure of sensitive information (e.g., configuration details, credentials, cryptographic keys).
- This vulnerability is related to, and less severe than,  CVE-2024-23897 (SECURITY-3314).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the SSH interface used by the `Git server Plugin`. An attacker would need to send a crafted Git command via SSH to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to send Git commands via SSH to the Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text references "limitations for reading binary files" which are similar to CVE-2024-23897. These limitations relate to character encoding when reading files.
- The advisory emphasizes the importance of applying updates promptly, regardless of the `file.encoding` system property, because there is a chance binary keys might be more readable than anticipated.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Git server Plugin 99.101.v720e86326c09.
- The recommended workaround is to disable the *SSHD Port* in the *SSH Server* settings.
