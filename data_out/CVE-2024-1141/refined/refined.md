Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1141:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `python-glance-store` package logs the `access_key` for the Glance Store when the DEBUG log level is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Sensitive information exposure: The access key, which is a credential, is logged in a debug log, which may be accessible to unauthorized users or systems depending on the log configuration and access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential compromise of the Glance Store: If an attacker gains access to the logs, they could obtain the access key and potentially gain unauthorized access to the Glance Store, leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to debug logs: An attacker would need to gain access to the system's log files where the debug logs are written, either by compromising the system directly or via other means of access to the logging system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the system's debug log files to extract the leaked access keys. This could be through direct access to the system, compromised systems, or compromised logging systems.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `python-glance-store` package.
- The fix involves preventing the access key from being logged when the debug log level is enabled.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 17.1 via RHSA-2024:2732.
