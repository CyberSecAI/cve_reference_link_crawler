- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Innovs HR WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's user input handling.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
