{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin` operation does not validate that the `num_segments` input is a scalar before accessing its value. It assumes it is a scalar, but if a non-scalar tensor is passed, this results in a `CHECK`-failure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing input validation of the `num_segments` tensor, leading to a potential `CHECK` failure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be triggered via a `CHECK`-failure, crashing the process using the vulnerable code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific input to `tf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin` where the `num_segments` argument is a non-scalar tensor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide inputs to the `tf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin` operation.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is located in the `UnsortedSegmentJoinOp::Compute` method in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/unsorted_segment_join_op.cc` file. The fix adds a check to ensure that the `num_segments` input is a scalar using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar(num_segments_tensor.shape())`."
