The provided content discusses a path traversal vulnerability found in multiple Flask-based Python projects. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the usage of `flask.send_file` with attacker-controlled input, allowing path traversal attacks. In some cases, the vulnerability is exacerbated by the use of `os.path.join` with untrusted input. This is because `os.path.join` will treat any path starting with a `/` as an absolute path and will ignore the preceding paths, making it insecure with untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, also known as directory traversal. This allows an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
*   **Insecure use of `flask.send_file`:** The `send_file` function in Flask is used without proper sanitization of input, directly using user-provided filenames.
*   **Insecure use of `os.path.join`:** The `os.path.join` function is used improperly with untrusted input when building the file path to be passed to `flask.send_file`. It does not correctly handle absolute paths from user input.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There's a lack of input validation and sanitization, especially for filenames, which makes the system vulnerable to the traversal attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including source code, configuration files, and critical system files.
*   **Confidential Data Breach:** Sensitive data like passwords and credentials can be compromised.
*   **Potential Partial Denial of Service:** Although not the primary impact, multiple requests for large files can lead to partial denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests by manipulating the filename parameter in the URL path. Specifically, `../` sequences or absolute paths in the filename parameter are used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacks do not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and URL manipulation to craft the malicious requests.

**Additional Information:**

The content includes details on how the vulnerability was discovered using CodeQL, and it references the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process with maintainers to fix this class of issue. It also touches on the debate around the validity of CVEs for personal/academic projects and the issues related to false positives in vulnerability scanners. The discussions also clarify that the issue lies in the usage of `os.path.join` with unvalidated user-supplied input and the use of `flask.send_file` without input validation.
