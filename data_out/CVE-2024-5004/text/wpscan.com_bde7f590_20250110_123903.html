## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CM Popup Plugin for WordPress < 1.6.6 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of the campaign settings, which could allow high privilege users such as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. As admin, create a new campaign (wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=cm-ad-item)
2. In the option, put the following payload in the Basic Visual > Width field: `asd</style><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. At https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=cm-ad-item preview the campaign to see the XSS
Note: Multiple fields are vulnerable
