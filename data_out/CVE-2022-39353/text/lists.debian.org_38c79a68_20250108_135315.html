Package        : node-xmldom
Version        : 0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21366 CVE-2022-39353
Debian Bug     : 1024736

It was discovered that node-xmldom, a standard XML DOM (Level2 CORE)
implementation in pure javascript, processed ill-formed XML, which may result in
bugs and security holes in downstream applications.

CVE-2021-21366

    xmldom versions 0.4.0 and older do not correctly preserve system
    identifiers, FPIs or namespaces when repeatedly parsing and serializing
    maliciously crafted documents.  This may lead to unexpected syntactic
    changes during XML processing in some downstream applications.

CVE-2022-39353

    Mark Gollnick discovered that xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed
    because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to
    the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting or throwing
    any error.  This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node
    in the tree, and may open security holes such as CVE-2022-39299 in
    downstream applications.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-xmldom packages.
