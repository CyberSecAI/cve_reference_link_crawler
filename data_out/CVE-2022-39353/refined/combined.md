Package        : node-xmldom
Version        : 0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-21366 CVE-2022-39353
Debian Bug     : 1024736

It was discovered that node-xmldom, a standard XML DOM (Level2 CORE)
implementation in pure javascript, processed ill-formed XML, which may result in
bugs and security holes in downstream applications.

CVE-2021-21366

    xmldom versions 0.4.0 and older do not correctly preserve system
    identifiers, FPIs or namespaces when repeatedly parsing and serializing
    maliciously crafted documents.  This may lead to unexpected syntactic
    changes during XML processing in some downstream applications.

CVE-2022-39353

    Mark Gollnick discovered that xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed
    because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to
    the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting or throwing
    any error.  This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node
    in the tree, and may open security holes such as CVE-2022-39299 in
    downstream applications.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.1.27+ds-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your node-xmldom packages.

For the detailed security status of node-xmldom please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/node-xmldom>

## Description

### Impact

xmldom parses XML that is not well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`, without reporting any error or throwing.

This breaks the assumption that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39299> and is a potential issue for dependents.

### Patches

Update to `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7`, `@xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4` (dist-tag `latest`) or `@xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4` (dist-tag `next`).

### Workarounds

One of the following approaches might help, depending on your use case:

* Instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only search in the `documentElement`.
* Reject a document with a document that has more then 1 `childNode`.

### **[markgollnick](/markgollnick)** commented [Jan 20, 2016](#issue-127575968)

| Bug Description: xmldom allows incoming documents to have multiple root element nodes. This appears to me to be a violation of the [W3C DOM Level 2 Core Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/DOM2-Core.pdf):  […] Each document contains zero or one doctype nodes, **one root element node,** and zero or more comments or processing instructions; the root element serves as the root of the element tree for the document. […]  — *from “What the Document Object Model is” (emphasis mine)*  **The root node is the unique node that is not a child of any other node.** All other nodes are children or other descendants of the root node.  — *from the Glossary (emphasis mine)*  **However,** the spec *also* says this:  […] However, **the DOM does not specify that documents must be implemented as a tree or a grove,** nor does it specify how the relationships among objects be implemented. **The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any convenient manner.** […]  — *from “What the Document Object Model is” (emphasis mine)*  The children of a `DocumentFragment` node are zero or more nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the document. `DocumentFragment` nodes do not need to be *well-formed XML documents* (although they do need to follow the rules imposed upon **well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top nodes**). For example, a `DocumentFragment` might have only one child and that child node could be a `Text` node. Such a structure model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML document.  — *from § 1.2 / Fundamental Interfaces / Interface DocumentFragment (emphasis mine)*  In light of this, for the record, **I actually don’t dislike the fact that xmldom can parse such documents.** This comes with a few reservations (outlined below) because it seems like the current behavior is contrary to what the specs (both W3C DOM Level 2 Core *and* [XML 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/#sec-well-formed)) assert ought to be the case. Bug Reproduction: The following code:  ``` var DOMParser = require('xmldom').DOMParser; var xmlData = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n' + '<root>\n' + '  <branch girth="large">\n' + '    <leaf color="green" />\n' + '  </branch>\n' + '</root>\n' + '<root>\n' + '  <branch girth="twig">\n' + '    <leaf color="gold" />\n' + '  </branch>\n' + '</root>\n'; var xmlDOM = new DOMParser().parseFromString(xmlData); console.log(xmlDOM.toString()); ```  …produces the following output:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><root>   <branch girth="large">     <leaf color="green"/>   </branch> </root> <root>   <branch girth="twig">     <leaf color="gold"/>   </branch> </root>  ```  In contrast to this, [libxmljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libxmljs) — which relies on [libxml2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/) — refuses to parse such documents, opting to throw an error instead:  ``` var xml = require('libxmljs'); var xmlDoc = xml.parseXmlString(xmlData); Error: Extra content at the end of the document ```  Firefox behaves in a similar way, and refuses to parse the document:  ``` console.log(   new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(     new DOMParser().parseFromString(xmlData, 'text/xml'))); ```  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <?xml-stylesheet href="chrome://global/locale/intl.css" type="text/css"?> <parsererror xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/xml/parsererror.xml">XML Parsing Error: junk after document element Location: about:blank Line Number 7, Column 1:<sourcetext>&lt;root&gt; ^</sourcetext></parsererror>  ```  Chrome goes a *little* bit farther in that it is at least willing to parse/render the first root element node:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <root>   <parsererror xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="display: block; white-space: pre; border: 2px solid #c77; padding: 0 1em 0 1em; margin: 1em; background-color: #fdd; color: black">     <h3>This page contains the following errors:</h3>     <div style="font-family:monospace;font-size:12px">error on line 7 at column 1: Extra content at the end of the document </div>     <h3>Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.</h3>   </parsererror>   <branch girth="large">     <leaf color="green"/>   </branch> </root>  ``` Expectations/Recommendations/Discussion:  * I expected the above document to fail to parse in xmldom's DOMParser implementation, but it didn’t. In light of the specs, this seems like it might be a “false-positive” bug. However, I think there *is* some utility in being able to parse multiple documents in a single stream, *if* the API can be re-tooled just a bit. More on this below. * In order to be more compliant with the specs, I think that if more than one root node is present in an XML stream — especially if they appear without corresponding `<?xml?>` declarations — then the DOMParser should, bare-minimum, simply opt to not support such streams, and should raise an error informing the consumer that the given XML stream is invalid. * **Alternatively,** if it is desired to keep the ability to parse multiple documents in a single stream — which I think would be useful functionality to retain: the alternative of requiring users to manually split XML documents crammed into a single stream before they can pass them into xmldom seems counter-intuitive to me, as that should be the job of the parser — then perhaps the DOMParser API could be re-tooled to return an *array* or a *list* of multiple document objects, each one with a singular root element node (rather than a *single* document object with *multiple root elements,* as is the case today), but *only in the event that multiple root elements are detected within the input stream.* I think that this behavior would help xmldom to be more compliant with the specs, *and* it would help to prevent consumers from accidentally generating poorly formed XML output from their parsed document objects, since each parsed document object would have only *one* root node, as the specs indicate ought to be the case.  Conclusion: On one hand, **I think it is a useful thing to be able to parse streams containing multiple XML documents.**  On the other hand, to do that silently without issuing even so much as a warning to consumers — especially when the specs say that root nodes should be unique — seems, well, odd. **It seems like the current behavior is more of an artifact or a side-effect of xmldom’s current architecture than it is an intentional aspect of its design,** hence my writing this up as a bug rather than a feature request. (If I’m mistaken, do let me know!) Environment/Versions:  * xmldom v0.1.21 |

| [@frumioj](https://github.com/frumioj) xmldom is currently maintained at <https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom>. What would you suggest that we change in the behavior/implementation (as in what should be the preferred behavior in the context of the issue you linked, what assumption was made, which xmldom didn't fulfill)? Feel free to involve/ping me in an already ongoing discussions elsewhere or to kick off the process following our [security policy](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom/security/policy). Thx for the information. |

Can the impacted version ranges be clarified? Affected versions: <=0.7.7 Patched versions: ~0.7.7  I guess that should probably be < not <=? |

(like sample saml or code snippet)  Trying to understand how `xml-crypto`'s [checkSignature](https://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml/blob/8b7e3f5a91c8e5ac7e890a0c90bc7491ce33155e/src/node-saml/xml.ts#LL103C10-L103C28) function would return true if it is given a bad/malformed xml  Asking this here because it looks like the root cause I'm also asking just for curiosity! |

[#150](https://github.com/jindw/xmldom/issues/150) is where this issue was raised from. Multiple root elements were parsed. Because the SAML specification expects only one root element (because that's what is expected from well-formed XML from the parse tree) this caused a successful injection of an attacker's signature. If you correctly follow the XML specification there should only be one root element in an XML document, and multiple root elements should produce an error from the XML parser. That would have prevented the ability for an attacker to inject a valid signature into the XML. |
