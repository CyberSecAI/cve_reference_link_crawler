## Commit

[Permalink](/discourse/discourse/commit/2c45b949ea0e9d6fa8e5af2dd07f6521ede08bf1)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

SECURITY: Filter unread bookmark reminders the user cannot see

[Browse files](/discourse/discourse/tree/2c45b949ea0e9d6fa8e5af2dd07f6521ede08bf1)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
There is an edge case where the following occurs:

1. The user sets a bookmark reminder on a post/topic
2. The post/topic is changed to a PM before or after the reminder
   fires, and the notification remains unread by the user
3. The user opens their bookmark reminder notification list
   and they can still see the notification even though they cannot
   access the topic anymore

There is a very low chance for information leaking here, since
the only thing that could be exposed is the topic title if it
changes to something sensitive.

This commit filters the bookmark unread notifications by using
the bookmarkable can_see? methods and also prevents sending
reminder notifications for bookmarks the user can no longer see.
