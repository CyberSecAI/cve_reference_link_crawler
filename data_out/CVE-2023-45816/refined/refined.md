Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an edge case where a user sets a bookmark reminder on a post/topic, and subsequently, the post/topic's permissions are changed such that the user no longer has access.  Despite the change in permissions, the user could still see the unread notification for that bookmark reminder.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Access Control:** Unread bookmark reminder notifications were not consistently filtered based on the user's current access permissions to the underlying bookmarked content. This allowed users to see notifications for content they no longer had permission to view.
*   **Potential Information Leakage:** Although the risk is described as very low, the vulnerability could potentially leak the title of a topic if it changed to something sensitive after the bookmark was created and access was revoked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is a minor information disclosure. An attacker could potentially see the title of a topic that they should no longer have access to via an unread bookmark reminder notification.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interaction:** An attacker must have previously created a bookmark on a topic/post, and then that topic/post needs to change to a state where the user should no longer have access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a registered user of the affected Discourse instance.
*   The attacker must be able to create bookmarks and set reminders.
*   The attacker must be a user who loses access to the bookmarked content.

**Mitigation:**

The fix for this vulnerability includes:

1.  **Filtering Notifications:** The code now filters unread bookmark notifications by checking if the user has `can_see?` permission on the bookmarked content.
2.  **Preventing Reminder Notifications:** Reminder notifications are no longer sent for bookmarks that the user can no longer access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
*   The fix involves changes to multiple files, indicating a comprehensive approach to address the issue in different parts of the application.
*   The commit messages and the security advisory clearly describe the problem and the fix.
*   The issue is fixed in Discourse versions 3.1.3 (stable) and 3.2.0.beta3 (beta/tests-passed) and later.
