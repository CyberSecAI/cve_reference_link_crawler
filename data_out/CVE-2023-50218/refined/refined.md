Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-50218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `ModuleInvoke` class. This lack of validation leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data: The application deserializes data provided by a user without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
