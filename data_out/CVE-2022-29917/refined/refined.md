Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29917:

**Root Cause:**
- Memory safety bugs were present in Firefox 99, Firefox ESR 91.8 and Thunderbird 91.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is the presence of memory safety bugs, leading to potential memory corruption. The specific nature of these bugs is not detailed but is listed in the referenced bug list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
