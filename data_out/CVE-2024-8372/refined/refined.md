Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8372

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of image source URLs within the `ngSrcset`, `ngAttrSrcset`, and `ngPropSrcset` directives of AngularJS. Specifically, the sanitization logic can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Sanitization:** The core issue is that the sanitization mechanisms in AngularJS for `srcset` attributes can be bypassed using specially crafted input.
- **Content Spoofing:** By bypassing sanitization, attackers can load images from arbitrary domains, potentially leading to content spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification (NetApp):** According to NetApp's advisory, successful exploitation could lead to the addition or modification of data.
- **Content Spoofing (HeroDevs):** The HeroDevs description details that an attacker can inject arbitrary content, modifying the page displayed to the user under the context of the trusted domain. This can lead to users viewing spoofed content, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`ngSrcset`, `ngAttrSrcset`, `ngPropSrcset` Directives:** Attackers can use these directives in an AngularJS application with a specially crafted value to bypass domain restrictions.
- **Interpolated Values:** Setting interpolated values via the *srcset* HTML attribute is also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject input:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious input through one of the vulnerable directives or attributes into an AngularJS application.
- **User interaction (Indirect):** The user must load the crafted page in their browser for the attack to be successful.
- **No Authentication Required (NetApp):** The CVSS vector from NetApp indicates that no privileges are needed to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** AngularJS versions 1.3.0-rc.4 and greater are affected.
- **Mitigation:** Since AngularJS is end-of-life, there are no official patches from the AngularJS project. HeroDevs offers a commercial solution with a fix in their "Never-Ending Support" version of AngularJS (v1.9.6 and v1.5.22). Other mitigations involve migrating away from AngularJS or using a commercial support partner for security fixes.
- **NetApp Products Affected:** The NetApp advisory lists several products affected, including Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux, Microsoft Windows, VMware vSphere, and SnapCenter, meaning the impact goes beyond just the AngularJS library itself.
