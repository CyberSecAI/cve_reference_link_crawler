The provided content is related to CVE-2022-34798.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Deployment Dashboard Plugin, up to version 1.0.10, lacks proper permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints. It also does not require POST requests for these endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization/Incorrect permission check:** The plugin does not check if the user has the required permissions before allowing access to certain HTTP endpoints.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP URL using attacker-specified username and password, potentially capturing credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can send a crafted request to vulnerable endpoints without proper authorization. The lack of POST request requirements allows for CSRF attacks through crafted links or HTML content on a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs Overall/Read permission to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a malicious link or viewing a malicious page.
