Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in Alien Technology ALR-F800 RFID reader, specifically versions 19.10.24.00 and lower, as described in the provided content:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthorized Command Execution (cmd.php):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/cmd.php` endpoint allows execution of arbitrary CLI commands without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control and insecure handling of user-supplied commands.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can modify network configurations and login credentials, such as resetting the web interface and SSH password.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cmd.php` with the `cmd` parameter set to a command such as `password=password`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.

2.  **Command Injection (upgrade.cgi):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` endpoint is vulnerable to command injection via a filename parameter. The application appends the filename to an update command without sanitization and executes it via `popen`.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure use of `popen` with unsanitized user-provided filename.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands. The provided example shows how to write a webshell to the webroot for further exploitation.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` with a malicious filename in the `uploadedFile` field. The command is injected using `;` to separate it from the legitimate update command.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated session after gaining initial access via the unauthorized command execution vulnerability in `/cmd.php`.

3.  **Command Injection (admin/system.html):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `/admin/system.html` endpoint allows command injection by uploading a file with a malicious filename. Similar to `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi`, the filename is used in an insecure command execution context.
    *  **Weakness:**  Insecure handling of user-provided filenames during file upload leading to command injection
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands. The provided example shows execution of the `whoami` command
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin/system.html` with a malicious filename in the `uploadedFile` field.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to authenticate with Digest authentication, which is implied through the provided POC.

**Summary of Key Points:**

*   The primary vulnerability across multiple endpoints is command injection due to insecure handling of filenames in shell commands.
*   The vulnerabilities allow unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
*   The impact includes compromising the device, modifying its configuration, and potentially using it as a foothold in the network.
*   The exploit vectors involve sending crafted HTTP requests to specific endpoints with malicious parameters or filenames.
* The vulnerabilities have been found in the GateScape web interface of the ALR-F800 RFID reader.
* The github content provides POC's to show how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
