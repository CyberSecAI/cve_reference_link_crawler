Deprecates the old langchain-hub repository. Does *not* deprecate the new <https://smith.langchain.com/hub>

[@PinkDraconian](https://github.com/PinkDraconian) has correctly raised that in the event someone is loading unsanitized user input into the `try_load_from_hub` function, they have the ability to load files from other locations in github than the hwchase17/langchain-hub repository.

This PR adds some more path checking to that function and deprecates the functionality in favor of the hub built into LangSmith.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@PinkDraconian](https://github.com/PinkDraconian) we've contacted Huntr to change the status of your report, and will assess it today to assign a proper CVSS score.  Going forward we ask that if you disagree with a decision and have a good argument for that please reach out to security@langchain.dev prior to filing the CVE, so we can discuss. Filing the CVE effectively blocks users from being able to deploy their applications, without an option to upgrade to get a security patch, and in this case it's dubious that the code actually poses any risk to users. |
