Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The GitLab DAST scanner, when authenticating to a target website, improperly handles redirects. Specifically, when the authentication page redirects to another domain (via 301, 302, 307, or 308 redirects), the DAST scanner forwards the cookies set by the original authentication domain to the redirected domain. This behavior is different from standard browser behavior, which should not send cross-site cookies on redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Cookie Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of cookies across different domains. Cookies set by the authentication domain are inadvertently sent to the redirected domain.
*   **Incorrect Redirect Handling:** The DAST scanner's handling of redirects deviates from expected browser behavior, causing the cookie leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The leaked cookies could contain sensitive information like authentication tokens, session IDs, or other user-specific data.
*   **Potential Account Hijacking:** If the leaked cookies contain session information, an attacker on the redirected domain could potentially impersonate the user, gaining access to the original site.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker could collect cookies from multiple domains and use them maliciously.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Redirect on Authentication Pages:** An attacker would need to control or influence an authentication page such that it redirects to an attacker-controlled domain, either through a form submission, a CSS stylesheet or an HTML tag with a redirecting URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control or Influence over Authentication Page:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the authentication page targeted by the DAST scan so that it redirects to an attacker controlled domain. This could be achieved by changing the target app of DAST or by somehow influencing an existing website used as target for the DAST scan.
*   **Ability to Catch Requests:** The attacker needs a way to capture the HTTP requests sent during the DAST scan, for example by using a request catcher service like webhook.site or Burp Collaborator.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue is described as distinct from previous similar reports, indicating this was either a bypass or a missed fix from prior patches.
*   The report provides a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) involving a PHP page that sets a cookie and redirects via both a form and a stylesheet.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated to occur both with form submission redirects and through redirects within linked resources.
*   The vulnerability was reproducible on gitlab.com.
