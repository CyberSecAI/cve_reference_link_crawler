|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Check fuzzing - https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/fuzz |
|  |  | \* Add the option to set custom key ID |
|  |  | \* Add creating a metadata from init struct |
|  |  | \* Support for hashbin delegations and succint roles |
|  |  | \* Make sure to not discard custom fields when converting, i.e. for keys and such |
|  |  | \* Verify and fix how rsa and ecdsa keys are stored |
|  |  | \* Revisit the design - should we use generics or just 4 different structs for each metadata type? |
|  |  | \* Investigate whether depending on `sigstore/signatures` can cause dependency cycle and if so, how to avoid it? |

|  |  | # <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/theupdateframework/artwork/3a649fa6/tuf-logo.svg" height="100" valign="middle" alt="TUF"/> A Framework for Securing Software Update Systems |
|  |  | ---------------------------- |
|  |  | [The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/) is a framework for |
|  |  | secure content delivery and updates. It protects against various types of |
|  |  | supply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | NGO-TUF is started from the idea of providing a Go implementation of TUF that is heavily influenced by the |
|  |  | design decisions made in [python-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | About The Update Framework |
|  |  | -------------------------- |
|  |  | The Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security of a |
|  |  | software update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository |
|  |  | or signing keys. |
|  |  | TUF provides a flexible |
|  |  | [specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md) |
|  |  | defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or |
|  |  | re-implement to fit their needs. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as |
|  |  | part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) |
|  |  | and its design is [used in production](https://theupdateframework.io/adoptions/) |
|  |  | by various tech companies and open source organizations. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Please see [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about TUF! |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | How to use it |
|  |  | ------------- |
|  |  | See the [basic\_repo.go](examples/basic\_repo.go) example which demonstrates how to \*manually\* create and |
|  |  | maintain repository metadata using the low-level Metadata API. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The example highlights the following functionality supported by the metadata API: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* creation of top-level metadata |
|  |  | \* target file handling |
|  |  | \* consistent snapshots |
|  |  | \* key management |
|  |  | \* top-level delegation and signing thresholds |
|  |  | \* metadata verification |
|  |  | \* target delegation |
|  |  | \* in-band and out-of-band metadata signing |
|  |  | \* writing and reading metadata files |
|  |  | \* root key rotation |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Roadmap |
|  |  | ------------- |
|  |  | [x] Bootstrap a metadata API implementation |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [x] Recreate the `basic\_repo.py` example |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [] Verify the metadata API is complete |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [] Implement a client (standalone package built on top of metadata, to be split into several other parts) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [] Implement a repository (standalone package built on top of metadata, to be split into several other parts) |
|  |  |  |

|  |  | \* [The TUF Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/) |

|  |  | Contact |
|  |  | ------- |
|  |  | Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed on the [#tuf] |
|  |  | (https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C8NMD3QJ3) channel on |
|  |  | [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | We strive to make the specification easy to implement, so if you come across |
|  |  | any inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let us know by sending an |
|  |  | email, or by reporting an issue in the GitHub [specification |
|  |  | repo](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues). |
