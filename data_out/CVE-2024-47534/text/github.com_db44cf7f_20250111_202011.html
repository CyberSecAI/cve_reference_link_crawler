### @AdamKorcz **[AdamKorcz](/AdamKorcz)** commented [Aug 6, 2024](#issue-2451719515)

Adds the first graph and target search test as mentioned in [#101](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/issues/101).

This adds the `get_targetinfo` client API for both clients too. This might need more work for tests that actually use the output. The test in this PR does not use the output.

Interestingly, go-tuf fails in an indeterministic manner from this test; Different test cases will fail each time you run the test. I have tried removing all the testcases except for the `"max-number-of-delegations"` one, and this still fails sometimes. [@rdimitrov](https://github.com/rdimitrov) could you check this? You can test it by cloning my branch and running `make test-go-tuf`. I have left some print statements for debugging assistance.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I'll have a look at the failures but as a first comment: Let's not expand the CLI if at all possible -- I'm not sure we can assume that all libraries even expose API like this. Can we not use `download` command to achieve similar testable situations? I especially don't want any kind of structured output requirements for the CLI: it is just a pain for client developers |

The issue at least with python-tuf can be reproduced with `--repository-dump-dir /tmp/dumps`. There's two issues that I can see :

1. The code added to clients/python-tuf assumes `get_targetinfo()` always returns TargetFile: this is untrue (maybe we should enable linting in clients, mypy would have complained about this: [lint: Add the python client to linted files #118](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/118))
2. The test also fails because the dumping code invoked by `--repository-dump-dir` uses fetch\_metadata() which ends up breaking FetchTracker.

If you use the already existing `metadata_statistics` and `artifact_statistics` instead of FetchTracker this should not be an issue (because those are bumped in `fetch()` that is only called by the http handler, not other code)

Sorry, something went wrong.

I know you said don't review yet... I'm doing that anyway since this is kind of blocking the continuation like [#140](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/140).

All comments are minor -- the only issue preventing merging is go-tuf flakiness. I don't have great ideas for dealing with that. We would have to either

* support skipping in the action API like we do expected failures
* or add a hard coded special case in the test until go-tuf is fixed

  ```
    if ("clients/go-tuf/go-tuf" in client._cmd):
       pytest.skip("skip for flakiness")

  ```

maybe the hard coded skip (and filing an issue to remind us to remove it) makes sense so we can move and merge this?

Sorry, something went wrong.
