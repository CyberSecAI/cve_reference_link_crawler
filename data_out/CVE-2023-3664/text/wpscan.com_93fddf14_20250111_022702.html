## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FileOrganizer < 1.0.3 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Access

### Description

The plugin does not restrict functionality on multisite instances, allowing site admins to gain full control over the server.

### Proof of Concept

On a multisite instance, log in as an admin. Click on File Organizer in the sidebar. The UI gives full control to the files on the server, despite not being a super admin.

### Affects Plugins
