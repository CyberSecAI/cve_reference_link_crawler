In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Release hbalock before calling lpfc_worker_wake_up()

lpfc_worker_wake_up() calls the lpfc_work_done() routine, which takes the
hbalock.  Thus, lpfc_worker_wake_up() should not be called while holding the
hbalock to avoid potential deadlock.
