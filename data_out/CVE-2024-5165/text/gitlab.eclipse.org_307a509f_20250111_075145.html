# Eclipse Ditto User Interface vulnerable to XSS due to "Improper Neutralization of Input"

The Eclipse Foundation is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) Numbering Authority. This issue it used to request and track the progress of the assignment of a CVE for a vulnerability in the project code for an Eclipse open source project.

## Basic information

**Project name:** Eclipse Ditto

**Project id:** iot.ditto

**Request type:** reservation

**Versions affected:** [3.0.0, 3.5.5]

**Common Weakness Enumeration:**

* {[CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)}

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System:** {[cvss](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)}

**Summary:**

In Eclipse Ditto versions 3.0.0 to 3.5.5, the user input of several input fields of the Eclipse [Ditto Explorer User Interface](https://eclipse.dev/ditto/user-interface.html) was not properly neutralized and thus vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting).

Several inputs were not persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, but only in local browser storage to save settings of "environments" of the UI and e.g. the last performed "search queries", resulting in a "Reflected XSS" vulnerability.

However, several other inputs were persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, leading to a "Stored XSS" vulnerability. Those mean that authenticated and authorized users at Eclipse Ditto can persist Things in Ditto which can - when being displayed by other users also being authorized to see those Things in the Eclipse Ditto UI - cause scripts to be executed in the browser of other users.
