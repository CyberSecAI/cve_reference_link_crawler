  "CVE-2022-29195": {
    "description": "The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StagePeek` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.",
    "root_cause": "The code assumes `index` is a scalar but there is no validation for this before accessing its value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a CHECK-failure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a non-scalar index argument to `tf.raw_ops.StagePeek`"

     "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide input to the `tf.raw_ops.StagePeek` function"

      "The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to verify that the input `index` is actually a scalar before treating it as such."
