Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35078

**Product:** Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication on specific API paths within the Ivanti EPMM software. This allows unauthenticated access to these paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated API Access:** The primary weakness is the ability to access certain API endpoints without authentication.
*   **Exposure of PII:** Vulnerable API paths expose sensitive user data.
*   **Configuration Modification:** The vulnerability allows for unauthorized changes to server configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to PII:** Attackers can gain access to personally identifiable information (PII) of users, including names, phone numbers, and mobile device details.
*   **Limited Server Changes:** Attackers can modify server configurations, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Software Installation and Profile Modification:** Attackers can install software and modify security profiles on registered devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Internet-Facing Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote actors with internet access to the affected EPMM server.
*   **API Endpoint Targeting:** Attackers specifically target vulnerable API paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable EPMM server, typically over the internet, since it is described as internet-facing.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to have valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Ivanti has released patches for supported versions of the product. An RPM script is provided for customers using earlier versions.
*   There is evidence that this vulnerability is being actively exploited.
*   The vulnerability does not allow attackers to create an EPMM administrator account directly.
