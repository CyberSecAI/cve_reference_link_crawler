Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9797
*   **Affected Product:** code-projects Blood Bank System
*   **Affected Version:** 1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `register.php`
*  **Vulnerable Parameter:** `$user`

*   **Root Cause:** The `$user` parameter in `register.php` is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)
*   **Attack Vector:**  Remote network. Attacker sends a malicious payload through the `user` parameter via a POST request to `register.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected `register.php` file.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL payload

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information.
    *   **Integrity:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Availability:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the service by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The code snippet provided demonstrates the vulnerability:
    ```php
    $user=$_POST['user'];
    $password=$_POST['pass'];
    $useremail=$_POST['useremail'];
    $bloodgroup=$_POST['bloodgroup'];
    $gender=$_POST['gender'];
    $s = "select * from login where user= '$user'";
    ```
*   The `$user` variable, taken directly from the POST request, is embedded directly into the SQL query, creating an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Proof of Concept (POC):**

*   A sample POST request is provided that shows how to inject SQL code using the `user` parameter:
    ```
    POST /register.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: bloodbankmgmtsystem
    ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 6
    ...
    user=1
    ```
*   The provided `sqlmap` command shows how to use `sqlmap` with the crafted request to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit has been publicly disclosed and may be used.
*   The vulnerability is considered easy to exploit.
*   A public exploit is available on GitHub (as a PHP script).
*   Google hacking can be used to find vulnerable targets using the `inurl:register.php` search term.
*   No specific counter measures are mentioned in the provided text.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a straightforward SQL injection issue due to a lack of input sanitization in the `register.php` file of the Blood Bank System version 1.0. An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract database information, modify database content or potentially disrupt service by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable without any authentication.
