- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MailerLite â€“ WooCommerce integration WordPress plugin does not implement sufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF. This vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions, under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could force a logged-in administrator to perform actions they did not intend to perform, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in settings or data within the WordPress site related to the MailerLite integration.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted by crafting a malicious request that the victim user unknowingly initiates while being authenticated to the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action (typically through social engineering). The user must have the required privileges to perform the targeted action within the plugin's functionality.
