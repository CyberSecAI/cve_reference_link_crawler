- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Evolution Controller web interface uses default credentials which are not changed on initial setup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of default credentials, lack of prompt or warning to change the default password, weak authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can log in to the server directly and perform administrative functions, leading to full control over the access control system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attacker with network access to the web interface.
