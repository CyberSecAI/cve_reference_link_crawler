**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs when handling XML data provided to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.

**Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious XML data to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable D-Link DAP-1325 router and no authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
