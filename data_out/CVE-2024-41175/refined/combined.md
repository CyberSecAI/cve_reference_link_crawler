# Update major version

This chapter describes how to update a major version from TwinCAT/BSD 12 to TwinCAT/BSD 13, for example. The current major version is required for security updates, among other things.

The update is carried out with the aid of a script, because the entire basic system as well as the kernel adapted by Beckhoff is updated. The script also automatically creates a restore point that you can jump back to (see: [Resetting to the restore point](8953028747.html)).

**Proceed as follows:**

1. Update the latest major version with `doas pkg update -f && doas pkg upgrade`.2. Install the script for the update with the command `doas pkg install tcbsd-upgrade`3. Execute the script with the command `doas tcbsd-upgrade major`. At the end of the process, a message about a successful update to the next major version is displayed.
```
Successfully upgraded to TC/BSD 13 and activated the new BE "upgrade-2022-02-17T15:02:01Z"
Reboot is required.
```
4. Restart TwinCAT/BSD with `shutdown -r now` after a successful update.After the restart, the new major version is available and displayed after the login.

## Adaptation of the boot environment

The upgrade is installed in a new boot environment. A boot environment is a ZFS file system that can be booted into. The old ZFS file system is therefore still available and can be used as a backup in case of emergency. You can always select the boot environment you want to boot into from the bootloader menu and the "Boot Environments" menu item (press the space bar while booting).

To remove the old boot environment and free the system from legacy issues, the following procedure is recommended after a successful upgrade:

1. Delete the restore point that is automatically created before the upgrade to the new major version. This also serves as a further fallback. Enter the command `doas restorepoint destroy`.
2. Select the restore point `upgrade-backup-<your timestamp>` from the menu to delete it.
3. Delete old boot environment (`default`) with `bectl destroy default`
4. Rename the new boot environment to `default` with `bectl rename upgrade-<timestamp> default`. There must always be a "default" boot environment so that the restore point `factoryreset` can work.

Notice : The boot environment `restore` must not be deleted.

### Beckhoff: Denial-of-Service vulnerability in the IPC-Diagnostics package included in TwinCAT/BSD operating system

Share:
Email |
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2024-049/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2024-049: Beckhoff%3A%20Denial-of-Service%20vulnerability%20in%20the%20IPC-Diagnostics%20package%20included%20in%20TwinCAT/BSD%20operating%20system)

#### ID

VDE-2024-049

#### Published

2024-08-27 10:00 (CEST)

#### Last update

2024-08-27 08:57 (CEST)

#### Vendor(s)

Beckhoff Automation GmbH & Co. KG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | IPC Diagnostics package | < 2.0.0.1 |
|  | TwinCAT/BSD | < 14.1.2.0\_153968 |

#### Summary

By default, TwinCAT/BSD-based products have a device-specific web interface for web-based management (WBM) enabled, developed by Beckhoff and known as Beckhoff Device Manager UI. It can be accessed remotely or locally. When accessed locally, a user can post specifically crafted input which then lets the process “MDPWebServer” consume a maximum of CPU cycles and Random Access Memory (RAM).

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2024-41175](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2024-41175)

#### Last Update:

Aug. 30, 2024, 9:21 a.m.

#### Severity

5.5

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling [(CWE-770)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html)

#### Summary

The IPC-Diagnostics package included in TwinCAT/BSD is vulnerable to a local denial-of-service attack by a low privileged attacker.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2024-41175)

---

#### Impact

A local, low privileged attacker could cause a denial-of-service.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

Avoid the existence of user accounts with login permission on the target other than administrator access.
By default, TwinCAT/BSD has preconfigured user accounts with lower privileges, but none of them have a
password, which results in them being denied remote access. Avoid running third-party applications on the target
that have not been properly audited, regardless of the user they are running as.

**Remediation**

Please update to a recent version of the affected product. In general, Beckhoff recommends updating the entire
TwinCAT/BSD operating system to a current version rather than individual packages. Information on updating
existing TwinCAT/BSD installations is available [here](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/content/1033/twincat_bsd/11780818443.html?id=4222392218353411614). There you will also find information on how to determine
the operating system version via the command line. This is also visible via the Beckhoff Device Manager UI.
Please note that when updating from the TwinCAT/BSD major version 12, two consecutive upgrades are required.
