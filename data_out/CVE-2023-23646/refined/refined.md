- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Album Gallery plugin <= 1.4.9 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force a higher-privileged user to perform actions without their consent. The specific impact can vary case-by-case but may lead to unauthorized changes or access to the website.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that is unknowingly executed by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in, higher-privileged user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site but requires the user to be logged into the vulnerable site.
