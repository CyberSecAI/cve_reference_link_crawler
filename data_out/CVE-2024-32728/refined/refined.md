- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact may vary.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via CSRF attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing an unwanted action on a malicious webpage.
