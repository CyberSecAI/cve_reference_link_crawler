Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-7289

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `paytium_sw_save_api_keys` function. This function is responsible for saving the plugin's API keys, which control access to the Mollie payment gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `paytium_sw_save_api_keys` function lacks a check to ensure that only authorized users (specifically, administrators) can modify the API keys.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The function directly updates options (API keys) based on user-provided input without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **API Key Manipulation:** An attacker can overwrite the plugin's API keys with their own.
- **Payment Diversion:** By changing the API keys, attackers can potentially divert payments intended for the site owner to their own accounts.
- **Loss of Control:**  The attacker gains control over the payment gateway integration, potentially disrupting services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
- **Web Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to trigger the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site, with subscriber-level access or higher.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the website.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function `paytium_sw_save_api_keys` is located in `admin/class-pt-ajax.php`.
- The fix implemented in version 4.4 of the plugin introduces a check using `current_user_can('administrator')` to verify that the user has the appropriate permissions before allowing the API keys to be modified.
- The updated code also uses `esc_attr` to sanitize the input values before saving to the database, which provides a measure of XSS protection, not related to the authorization bypass.

**Summary of Changes:**
The provided diffs show that in multiple functions within `/admin/class-pt-ajax.php`,  the code was updated to include a check for administrator privileges before processing the request. For instance, in the `paytium_sw_save_api_keys` function, the code now includes `if (current_user_can('administrator'))` before executing the rest of the function's logic, preventing unauthorized users from modifying the API keys.

Additionally, several instances of output escaping and sanitization were introduced across multiple files, using functions like `esc_attr()` and `sanitize_text_field()`. This is mainly to prevent XSS attacks, but it's important to note that the primary vulnerability was the authorization bypass.
