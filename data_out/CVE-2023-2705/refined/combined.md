# Appointment booking addon for Gravity Forms < 1.10.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against admin

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a "Service" and a "Provider" under the "gAppointments" sidebar menu.
2. Create a new form within Gravity Forms. Add a "Booking Calendar" field to this form.
3. Add the form to a post or page, using the block or shortcode.
4. Visit the page as any user (authenticated or not). Choose an appointment slot in the booking calendar field. Submit the form, and intercept the request (e.g. with BurpSuite).
5. In the POST request, change the value of input\_6[time] to be blank (note that it may be called something other than input\_6 on your site.
6. Then, change the value of input\_6[cost] (same caveat on the naming) to '/><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
7. Submit the request and disable interception. See the alert, indicating XSS.
