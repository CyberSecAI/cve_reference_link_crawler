- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X_B or X_T files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction. The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (specifically crafted X_B or X_T files).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious X_B or X_T file or create a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the application. The attacker needs to trick the user into interacting with the malicious file or page.
