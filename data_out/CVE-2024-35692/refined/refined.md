- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions that are intended for users with higher privileges. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
