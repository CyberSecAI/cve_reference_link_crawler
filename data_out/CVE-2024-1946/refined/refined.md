Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1946

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Genesis Blocks plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied content when rendering blocks, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to Stored XSS. This type of vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is stored on the server and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can inject malicious web scripts into pages created using the vulnerable plugin. When other users access these pages, the injected scripts will execute within their browsers. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites
    - Defacing web pages
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- Block Content: The vulnerability is triggered via the block content of the plugin. An authenticated attacker can inject the malicious payload through the block content editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: An attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "contributor" access or higher. This level of access allows them to create and modify content, including adding blocks.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Genesis Blocks plugin up to and including 3.1.2.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn\_) of VNPT-VCI.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `postTitleTag` and `sectionTitleTag` attributes in the "Post Grid" block are sanitized to only allow heading tags (`h1`-`h6`) and that the `sectionTag` attribute only allows specific valid tags (`div`, `header`, `section`, `article`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`).
