- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the way TYPO3 handles frontend login for users organized in different storage folders. The system incorrectly handles username ambiguity, allowing an attacker to potentially access a different account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak authentication (CWE-287), Improper Authorization (CWE-302).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A potential attacker can gain unauthorized access to a different frontend user account. Although credentials must be known, the attacker can potentially access a user account they were not intended to access. This can lead to data leaks, and data manipulation due to the partial impact on integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the username and password of a valid user and be able to send requests over a network. The attacker must have low privileges and needs no user interaction. The attack complexity is high because it involves bypassing authentication and the user names can be ambiguous.
