Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Html` writer in PhpSpreadsheet not sanitizing spreadsheet styling information, specifically font names, when generating HTML output. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code via crafted font names within spreadsheet files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the HTML output by manipulating spreadsheet styles. The injected JavaScript then executes within the context of a user's browser when they view the generated HTML.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The root cause is the failure to sanitize styling information like font names which are included in the HTML output. This allows for the inclusion of malicious HTML tags within the generated HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Takeover of User Session:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session. This can lead to full session takeover by the attacker.
- **Data theft, redirection, other malicious actions:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other actions within the user's session.
- **Compromised Integrity of Output:** Maliciously crafted output could lead to a compromise in the integrity of the intended output/content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network based, as an attacker must provide a crafted spreadsheet file to a user of the software.
- **Crafted Spreadsheet Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted spreadsheet file with malicious styling that will be written to HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious Spreadsheet Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a spreadsheet file (e.g., Xlsx) and include malicious HTML in cell style definitions. Specifically, by including malicious JavaScript in font names.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious spreadsheet through the PhpSpreadsheet library and generate HTML with the unsafe styling.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of PhpSpreadsheet `< 2.1.0` and `< 1.29.1`.
- The vulnerability has been patched in versions `2.1.0` and `1.29.1`.
- The vulnerability was reported by emilvirkki.
- The fix implemented in pull request #3957, addresses the issue by sanitizing the HTML tags within comments using `htmlspecialchars`, and by also sanitizing the font names to prevent script injection.
