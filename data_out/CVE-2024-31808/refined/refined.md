- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Command Injection vulnerability via the `webWlanIdx` parameter in the `setWebWlanIdx` function within the `wireless.so` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `webWlanIdx` parameter in the `setWebWlanIdx` function is not properly sanitized, allowing for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `webWlanIdx` parameter of the `setWebWlanIdx` function. The attacker can inject malicious commands, leading to remote code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted request with a malicious payload to the affected function. The attacker needs access to the web interface of the router.
