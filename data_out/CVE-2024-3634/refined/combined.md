## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# month name translation benaceur < 2.3.8 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=month-name-translation-benaceur
2. For the name of the month "January" add the payload `"><script>alert(1)></script>
3. Click "Save Changes" and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
