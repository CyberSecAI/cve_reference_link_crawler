  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls, leading to sensitive data exposure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive Data Exposure",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can view sensitive information not normally available to regular users, which can then be used to exploit other weaknesses in the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is not explicitly described, however, given the unauthenticated requirement, it's likely the vulnerability can be exploited via a network request to a vulnerable endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
