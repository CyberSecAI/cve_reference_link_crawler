- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Don't Muck My Markup Plugin, in versions 1.8 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions the user is tricked into performing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious link or website that is used to make the user unknowingly perform unwanted actions when logged into the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, while they are also logged into the affected WordPress plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
