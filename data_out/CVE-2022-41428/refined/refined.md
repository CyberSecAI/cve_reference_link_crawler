The provided content describes three distinct heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in Bento4, specifically within the `mp4tag` and `mp4mux` utilities.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_Atom::TypeFromString(char const*)`.
*   **Weakness:** The `TypeFromString` function attempts to read past the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:**  A crash due to memory corruption.
*  **Attack vector**: Processing a crafted MP4 file with `mp4tag --remove 1`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP4 file that triggers the overflow when processed by `mp4tag`.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)`.
*   **Weakness:** Improper bounds checking within the bit reading function.
*   **Impact:** A crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted MP4 file with `mp4mux --track h264`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP4 file that causes the `ReadBits` function to read beyond allocated memory when processed by `mp4mux`.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*  **Root Cause**: Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBit()`.
*   **Weakness**:  Improper bounds checking when reading bits from a buffer.
*   **Impact:** A crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted MP4 file with `mp4mux --track h264`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious MP4 file that triggers the overflow in `ReadBit` when processed by `mp4mux`.
