### Summary:
The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2024-1760) in the "Appointment Booking Calendar — Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin" for WordPress, affecting versions up to and including 1.6.6.20. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin’s settings by tricking a site administrator into clicking a malicious link.

### Root Cause:
The vulnerability stems from the `ssa_factory_reset()` function lacking proper nonce validation. This function is responsible for deleting all plugin settings and truncating database tables, and without proper CSRF protection, an attacker can trigger it via a crafted request.

### Weaknesses:
*   **Missing or Incorrect Nonce Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper nonce verification in the `ssa_factory_reset()` function. Nonces are cryptographic tokens used to ensure that requests originate from legitimate user sessions, preventing CSRF attacks.

### Impact:
*   **Plugin Data Reset:** Successful exploitation leads to the complete reset of the plugin's settings and data. This can severely disrupt the functionality of the booking calendar, potentially causing loss of configuration, appointments, and customer data.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By resetting plugin settings, the attacker renders the plugin unusable, effectively causing a DoS.

### Attack Vectors:
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The attack vector is CSRF, where an attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, executes the `ssa_factory_reset()` function.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a forged form to exploit this vulnerability.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to socially engineer an administrator to interact with the malicious link or form.
*   **Target Interaction:** The attacker needs an authenticated admin to click a link or perform a similar action.

### Additional Technical Details:
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `class-support.php` file of the plugin.
*   The fix involves adding a nonce check to the ssa_factory_reset function to ensure that the request is legitimate.
* The `render_secret_support_page` function generates a support page with links to these actions, which are protected by a nonce and user capability check. However, the `ssa_factory_reset()` action was missing the nonce check.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.6.6.24 of the plugin.
