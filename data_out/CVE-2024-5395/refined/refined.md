Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `FullName` parameter in the `listofinstructor.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `listofinstructor.php` file
- Insufficient input validation of the `FullName` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Potential for complete system control
- Service disruption

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `FullName` parameter in the `listofinstructor.php` file.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `FullName` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `listofinstructor.php` file
- No special authentication is mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability is likely exploitable by any user that has access to the endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `Online Student Enrollment System Project In PHP` version 1.0.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The vulnerable file is `listofinstructor.php`.
- The `FullName` parameter is the entry point for the SQL injection.
- A sample SQLmap payload is provided as proof of concept.
- The suggested fixes include using prepared statements, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
