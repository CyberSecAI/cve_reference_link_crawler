{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mac` variable in the `formWriteFacMac` function is directly passed to a `doSystemCmd` function without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/goform/WriteFacMac` with a malicious `mac` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device."
