Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2021-47404.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The hid-betopff driver in the Linux kernel assumes that a device will always have an input report. Malicious devices can violate this assumption leading to a slab-out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The driver lacks proper validation of the existence of input reports.
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to the assumption of non-empty input reports.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious device can cause a slab-out-of-bounds write leading to a system crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Connecting a specially crafted malicious HID device to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the system to connect the malicious HID device or the ability to emulate a HID device.
