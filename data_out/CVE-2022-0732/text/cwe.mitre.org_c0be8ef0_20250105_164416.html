| | CWE Glossary Definition | x | | --- | --- | |  | |      CWE-284: Improper Access Control  | Weakness ID: 284 [Vulnerability Mapping](#Vulnerability_Mapping_Notes_284): DISCOURAGED This CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities    Abstraction: Pillar Pillar - a weakness that is the most abstract type of weakness and represents a theme for all class/base/variant weaknesses related to it. A Pillar is different from a Category as a Pillar is still technically a type of weakness that describes a mistake, while a Category represents a common characteristic used to group related things. | | --- |    View customized information:  Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  Operational For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  Mapping Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.    × Edit Custom Filter Conceptual Operational Mapping Friendly Select All     Reset Clear Submit Cancel       + Description  The product does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.    + Extended Description   Access control involves the use of several protection mechanisms such as:   * Authentication (proving the identity of an actor) * Authorization (ensuring that a given actor can access a resource), and * Accountability (tracking of activities that were performed)   When any mechanism is not applied or otherwise fails, attackers can compromise the security of the product by gaining privileges, reading sensitive information, executing commands, evading detection, etc.  There are two distinct behaviors that can introduce access control weaknesses:   * Specification: incorrect privileges, permissions, ownership, etc. are explicitly specified for either the user or the resource (for example, setting a password file to be world-writable, or giving administrator capabilities to a guest user). This action could be performed by the program or the administrator. * Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings). This problem occurs within the program itself, in that it does not actually enforce the intended security policy that the administrator specifies.     + Alternate Terms  | Authorization: | The terms "access control" and "authorization" are often used interchangeably, although many people have distinct definitions. The CWE usage of "access control" is intended as a general term for the various mechanisms that restrict which users can access which resources, and "authorization" is more narrowly defined. It is unlikely that there will be community consensus on the use of these terms. | | --- | --- |       + Common Consequences Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Scope | Impact | Likelihood | | --- | --- | --- | | Other | Technical Impact: *Varies by Context* |  |      + Potential Mitigations  | Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software. | | --- | | Phase: Architecture and Design  Strategy: Separation of Privilege   Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.  Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges. |       +  Relationships  Section Help This table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.  + Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)  | Nature | Type | ID | Name | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | MemberOf | View View - a subset of CWE entries that provides a way of examining CWE content.
