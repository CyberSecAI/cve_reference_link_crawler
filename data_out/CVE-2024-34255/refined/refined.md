Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "leave a message" function of jizhicms V2.5.1, specifically on the contact page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input (the message content) is not sanitized when submitted and stored in the system. When an administrator views the message, the unsanitized payload is executed in their browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a message, and that code will be executed when an administrator views that message.
- **Potential Account Takeover:** Depending on the administrator's actions and the specific JavaScript injected, an attacker could gain control over the administrator's account, steal their session cookie, perform actions on their behalf, or redirect them to a malicious site.
- **Other malicious activities:** The attacker could potentially deface the site, steal data, or perform other malicious actions on the server or client side.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Contact Form:** An attacker can use the contact form on `http://xxx/contact.html` to submit a message containing the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require any existing access to the system or any special administrative privileges.
- **Access to the contact page:** The attacker must have access to the vulnerable contact page.
- **Ability to fill the form:** The attacker must be able to fill and submit the contact form with a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was demonstrated using the payload: `<img src onerror=_=alert,_(13232)>`. This is a common XSS payload that triggers an alert box.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the message in the admin panel and clicks the 'reply' button.
- The payload is stored within the system and not sanitized on display, which allows it to be executed.
