# ReDoS in LDAP schema parser (GHSL-2021-117 #424)

Moderate

[encukou](/encukou)
published
GHSA-r8wq-qrxc-hmcm
Nov 26, 2021

## Package

pip

python-ldap
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.4

## Patched versions

3.4.0

## Description

[#424](https://github.com/python-ldap/python-ldap/issues/424)

### Impact

The LDAP schema parser of python-ldap 3.3.1 and earlier are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service attack. The issue affects clients that use `ldap.schema` package to parse LDAP schema definitions from an untrusted source.

### Patches

The upcoming release of python-ldap 3.4.0 will contain a workaround to prevent ReDoS attacks. The schema parser refuses schema definitions with an excessive amount of backslashes.

### Workarounds

As a workaround, users can check input for excessive amount of backslashes in schemas. More than a dozen backslashes per line are atypical.

### References

[CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
