{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LDAP schema parser in python-ldap versions 3.3.1 and earlier is vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from a poorly crafted regular expression used in the LDAP schema parser which is susceptible to ReDoS attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming excessive resources of the system parsing the schema. This is caused by the parsing taking an excessive amount of time, making the service unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `ldap.schema` package parses LDAP schema definitions from an untrusted source. An attacker can supply a malicious schema with a large number of backslashes which trigger the ReDoS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted LDAP schema definition to the application that is using the vulnerable `ldap.schema` package. No special privileges are required, however, as mentioned in the CVSS score, low privileges are needed. User interaction is not required."
