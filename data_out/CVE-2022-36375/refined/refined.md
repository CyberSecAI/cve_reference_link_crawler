Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Broken Access Control issue. The core problem lies in the lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in certain functions of the WordPress Tabs plugin. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privilege levels, like administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce proper access controls. This is evident in multiple areas of the plugin:
    *   The `post_oxi_settings` function in `Build_Api.php` did not sanitize input leading to arbitrary option updates.
    *   The `WooCommerce.php` file was not sanitizing tab titles, priorities, contents, or callbacks.
    *   The `Template.php` file was not sanitizing the page parameter when determining if a template should be loaded.
    *   The `Create.php` file was not sanitizing the layouts parameter
    *   The `Home.php` file was not checking user capability before allowing file upload.
    *   The `Old_Admin.php` file did not sanitize the item id and did not use `prepare` in an update query, and failed to verify the nonce for file save operations.
    *  The old admin style files also did not sanitize form data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that an unprivileged user could potentially:

*   Modify plugin settings.
*   Modify WooCommerce tab layouts.
*  Update plugin data arbitrarily using POST requests.
*   Upload arbitrary files.
*   Modify tab styles.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves sending crafted POST requests to the plugin's backend, bypassing the intended access controls.
*  Unsanitized GET parameters also provided an attack vector.
*   Uploading of arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user of the WordPress site, although not necessarily an administrator. They require the ability to make POST requests and have some knowledge of the plugin's structure and endpoints.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.7.0 of the plugin.
*   The provided changeset shows the specific code modifications made to address the vulnerability, including the use of `sanitize_text_field()` to clean user input and the use of `wp_nonce_field` to verify requests.

In summary, CVE-2022-36375 highlights a serious broken access control issue in the WordPress Tabs plugin, allowing potentially malicious users to gain access to restricted functionality by exploiting the lack of proper checks, ultimately enabling a range of malicious actions by attackers. The identified fixes include sanitization and proper nonce verification.
