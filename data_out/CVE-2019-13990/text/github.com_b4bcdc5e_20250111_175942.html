| The method initDocumentParser() in the XMLSchedulingDataProcessor.java does not forbid DTDs, which allows a context-dependend attacker to perfom an [XXE](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing). The vulnerability is confirmed working in version 2.2.3.  I reported this issue to the MITRE cooperation already which assigned the identifier [CVE-2019-13990](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13990) to this vulnerability. Please confirm the existence of this vulnerability so that the CVE-entry can be completed and published.  The OWASP Foundation provides an [XXE Prevention CheatSheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) that explains in detail the steps to prevent this security issue.  Credits to Andreas Schoedl for working out the relevant code section affected by this issue. |

| [@julyhurt](https://github.com/julyhurt) I think it depends on how you're using and driving Quartz. For context, I'm coming from Apache TomEE, where we have an old version of TomEE that uses Quartz for EJB timers, so we're using it as a library, rather than standalone. Its possible that our use of Quartz isn't actually vulnerable, but this issue flagged up on a scan, so I'm more than happy to help fix it.  In terms of mitigating this without a patch - if you're passing XML to Quartz, and that XML is untrusted, I would do something to check it before handing it over to Quartz - so that might mean parsing it with a well configured parser first, and then passing it to Quartz.  There's no 2.3.x branch, but I'm happy to patch 2.3.0 and create a branch for that. I'm not a committer on Quartz though, so I can't actually get anything into the repository, or get a release made. I have tried posting to the user and dev forums, both of which seem to have disappeared (for me at least) and I've tried emailing SoftwareAG to see if they need a signed CLA, per the guidelines here: <https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/blob/master/docs/contribute.adoc>. I've heard nothing back, so I'm starting to be a little concerned that potentially no-one is working on the project any more. |

| [@vineetpandey](https://github.com/vineetpandey) It does affect 2.3.1. There's no 2.3.x branch for me to create a PR against. There doesn't seem to be much movement here, but it seems like there are folks interested in patches, so I'm trying to push some new binaries so people can try them out. I would create a 2.3.x as part of that. |

| As there hasn't been any activity on this for over a month now, I have forked this repository, and created builds for 2.2.x and 2.3.x, and have staging repositories for both on oss.sonatype.org (these would go on to Maven central if promoted):  <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgtomitribe-1071/> -> 2.2.4 (source: <https://github.com/tomitribe/quartz/tree/quartz-2.2.4>) <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgtomitribe-1072> -> 2.3.2 (source: <https://github.com/tomitribe/quartz/tree/quartz-2.3.2>)  I'm doing some testing on these here, but I'd be grateful if anyone else can try too ([@krabbenpuler](https://github.com/krabbenpuler), maybe you could try your tests against these to see if my patch holds up)  Please note that the groupId for these artifacts is `org.tomitribe.quartz` as opposed to `org.quartz-scheduler`, so your dependency would need to be  ```     <dependency>       <groupId>org.tomitribe.quartz</groupId>       <artifactId>quartz</artifactId>       <version>${quartz.version}</version>     </dependency>  ```  I don't know how long the staging repositories will be kept on oss.sonatype.org for, but I suspect its 14 days. We'd need to promote or drop them in that time. |

| So the mechanism for the vulnerability to be exploited is someone allowing their quartz to be configured by arbitrary submissions from a client? Seems like a bizarre use-case but happy for the vulnerability to be fixed. Doesn't strike me as urgent to fix but I'd also comment that I like to see projects releasing often with minor fixes as well. |

| [@CiaranLMurphy](https://github.com/CiaranLMurphy) You're welcome!  Your use of CronScheduleBuilder *sounds* ok, but obviously everyone needs to make their own assessments, as there are different ways of using Quartz. I can't guarantee that a specific use-case is "fine" or not.  Checking whether this method is called in your system is a start: <https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/blob/master/quartz-core/src/main/java/org/quartz/xml/XMLSchedulingDataProcessor.java#L166> |

I also would like to see a Terracotta version published, but I haven't seen any activity on this project from its committers for something like 7 months, so I'm not sure what will happen.  I did publish my binaries (under a org.tomitribe.quartz groupId) on Maven central in case anyone wishes to use them: <https://mvnrepository.com/search?q=org.tomitribe.quartz>. Corresponding source code is here: <https://github.com/tomitribe/quartz/tree/quartz-2.2.4> and here: <https://github.com/tomitribe/quartz/tree/quartz-2.3.2>. |

| [@melloware](https://github.com/melloware) I'm working on trying to get a future plan for Quartz figured out, but this is something that will have to happen on its own timeframe - it's likely going to involve a lot of moving parts, many of which I have little to no influence over. Once I have the beginning of a plan figured out I'll likely file an issue for it here. In the meantime I'll look in to whether I can independently get this specific issue released on a shorter timeframe. |
