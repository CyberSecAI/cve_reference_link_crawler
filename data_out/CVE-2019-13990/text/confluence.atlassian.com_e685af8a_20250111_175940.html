| Summary | CVE-2019-13990 - XXE (XML External Entity Injection) Vulnerability in Jira Service Management Data Center and Server |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory Release Date | Tue, Oct 17 2023 10:00 PDT |
| Products | * Jira Service Management Data Center * Jira Service Management Server |
| CVE ID | CVE-2019-13990 |
| Related Jira Ticket(s) | * [JSDSERVER-14401](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-14401) |

## Summary of Vulnerability

Certain versions of Jira Service Management Server & Data Center were affected by CVE-2019-13990. The affected versions contained vulnerable versions of Terracotta Quartz Scheduler which allowed authenticated attackers to initiate an XML External Entity injection attack using job descriptions.

Atlassian has committed to issuing critical advisories based on the NVD vulnerability score, in this case the CVSS for this third party CVE is critical (9.8), but this score doesn’t always account for the context in which a vulnerable component is used in our software. Unauthenticated attackers without local access to the system are unable to exploit this vulnerability. As such, our internal assessment of this vulnerability is scored as high severity.

### Severity

While NVD rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as high (8.4 with the following vector CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) per our internal assessment. This is our assessment, and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Affected Versions

This XXE (XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability affects all versions including and after 4.20.0 of Jira Service Management Data Center and Server. Versions outside of the support window could be affected, Atlassian recommends upgrading to the fixed LTS version or later.
