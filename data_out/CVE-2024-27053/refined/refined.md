    "root_cause": "The code dereferences an RCU (Read-Copy-Update) pointer without being within an RCU read critical section.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect RCU usage",
       "RCU pointer dereferenced outside of RCU read critical section"

      "Connecting to a Wi-Fi network"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to initiate a Wi-Fi connection"
    ]
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function within the `drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/hif.c` file. The function attempts to parse target BSS parameters during a Wi-Fi connection. It dereferences the RCU pointer `bss->ies` without being in an RCU critical section, leading to the warning. To fix this, the code is modified to copy the `ies->data` into `ies_data` within an RCU read critical section, and use the copy. The fix ensures that RCU pointers are accessed safely within their designated critical sections."
