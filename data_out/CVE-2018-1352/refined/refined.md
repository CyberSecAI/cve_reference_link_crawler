- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A format string vulnerability exists in the handling of SSH usernames when connecting to FortiOS 5.6.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability in SSH username handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the format string vulnerability when an SSH connection is made to a vulnerable FortiOS device with a specially crafted username.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to initiate an SSH connection with a crafted username to the vulnerable FortiOS device, which can be done remotely if SSH is exposed.
