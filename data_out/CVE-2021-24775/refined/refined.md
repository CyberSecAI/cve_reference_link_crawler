- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Document Embedder plugin contains a REST endpoint that does not properly restrict access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated users can access the REST endpoint and retrieve the title of private or draft posts. This is a Sensitive Data Disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can enumerate the titles of arbitrary private and draft posts which are not meant to be publicly accessible.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a request to the vulnerable REST endpoint, `https://example.com/wp-json/doc/v1/single/509`, where 509 is the ID of the private/draft post, reveals the title of the post in the response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is needed. The attacker only needs to send the request to the vulnerable endpoint.
