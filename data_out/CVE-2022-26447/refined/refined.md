- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in BT firmware leading to an out-of-bounds write due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE) without requiring additional execution privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation occurs through the Bluetooth firmware.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No user interaction is needed for exploitation. An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range to exploit the vulnerability.
