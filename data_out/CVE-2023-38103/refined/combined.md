# Advisory Details

July 27th, 2023
## GStreamer RealMedia File Parsing Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-1007ZDI-CAN-21443

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-38103](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38103) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GStreamer. Interaction with this library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of MDPR chunks. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | GStreamer has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2023-07-06 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2023-07-27 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
