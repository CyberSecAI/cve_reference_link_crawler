Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-5645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `button_css_id` parameter within the Button widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to:
    - Account takeover
    - Data theft
    - Malicious redirects
    - Other malicious actions on the site

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the "Button" widget of the Envo Extra plugin.
- The `button_css_id` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher within the WordPress site.
- They can then inject malicious code through the vulnerable parameter.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `button.php` file of the plugin, specifically in the `render` function. The vulnerable code is:
```php
$attr = ( $settings[ 'button_css_id' ] ) ? ' id="' . $settings[ 'button_css_id' ] . '"' : '';
```
This code directly uses the `button_css_id` setting without any sanitization, making it possible to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. The fix involves using `esc_html()` to sanitize the `button_css_id` input before rendering it in the HTML:
```php
$attr = ( $settings[ 'button_css_id' ] ) ? ' id="' . esc_html($settings[ 'button_css_id' ]) . '"' : '';
```

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.8.25 of the Envo Extra plugin.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database entry provides additional information and links.
- Other files were also patched in version 1.8.25 related to XSS vulnerabilities in other widgets of the plugin (`team.php` and `testimonial.php`) using `esc_url()` and `esc_attr()` respectively.
