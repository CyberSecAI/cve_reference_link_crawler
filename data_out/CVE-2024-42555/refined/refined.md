Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Hotel-Management-System is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate the origin of requests before performing actions. Specifically, the `/admin_room_removed.php` endpoint is susceptible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The application lacks protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
-  **Lack of CSRF tokens:** It is likely that the web application doesn't use anti-CSRF tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can potentially escalate privileges by performing actions on behalf of an authenticated user, such as removing rooms via `/admin_room_removed.php`.
-  **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can trick the authenticated administrator into removing rooms, causing potential data loss or disruption of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** An attacker could embed a malicious form on a website that is visited by an authenticated user of the Hotel-Management-System. The form would automatically submit a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Malicious link:** The attacker could send a crafted link via email or other means that triggers a request to the vulnerable endpoint if clicked by an authenticated user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker must be able to trick or lure an authenticated user of the Hotel-Management-System to click on a malicious link or load a malicious web page.
-   The attacker needs to know the URL endpoint that is vulnerable which is `/admin_room_removed.php`.
-   The attacker does not require access to the server.

**Additional details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how an attacker can create an HTML form that sends a POST request to `/admin_room_removed.php` with parameters `rooms` and `noofrooms`, which can remove rooms without authorization.
- The vulnerability was found in the codebase with commit id <= `91caab8e505a1791780594d23408fb31fcc272cc`.
- This analysis provides more specific details than the official CVE description (PLACEHOLDER).
