Root cause of vulnerability: Sending a specific reset UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) request via the OBDII port.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of a reset UDS request leading to unintended shutdown.

Impact of exploitation: Vehicle engine shutdown and denial of service of other vehicle components, potentially while the vehicle is moving. However, safety-critical functions are not affected.

Attack vectors: Sending a specific reset UDS request via the OBDII port.

Required attacker capabilities/position: Access to the vehicle's OBDII port and ability to send specific UDS requests.
