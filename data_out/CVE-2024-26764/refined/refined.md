  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The `kiocb_set_cancel_fn()` function was being called for I/O operations submitted through `io_uring`, which it is not designed to handle. This resulted in a kernel warning due to the incorrect use of the cancel function with io_uring",

        "Submitting I/O operations via `io_uring` that would trigger the use of the incorrect cancel function `kiocb_set_cancel_fn()`"
