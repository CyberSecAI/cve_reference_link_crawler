{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a malformed nanomsg message sent to the FortiClient process via the IPC socket.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The FortiClient application does not properly handle malformed nanomsg messages, leading to a denial-of-service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit can cause FortiClient processes to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the local IPC socket of the FortiClient process. An attacker can inject specially crafted client requests.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have low-privilege access to the system where FortiClient is running to inject the malicious nanomsg messages via the local IPC socket."
