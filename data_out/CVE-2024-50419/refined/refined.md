*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is a broken access control vulnerability, specifically the lack of proper authorization checks before executing certain actions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is described as low severity, with potential for unprivileged users to perform actions they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact will vary depending on the privileged action that can be accessed without proper authorization.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector is through a function within the plugin that lacks proper authorization checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An unauthenticated attacker is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability, meaning no prior user account or login is required.
