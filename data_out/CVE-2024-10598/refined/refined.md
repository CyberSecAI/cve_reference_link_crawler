Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `general/hr/setting/attendance/leave/data.php` file of Tongda OA. This file lacks proper login verification, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of login verification for the `data.php` file. This allows unauthenticated users to access and manipulate data.
*   **Improper Authorization:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of annual leave rest time data.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  It also allows the viewing of all system user names without any authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify annual leave data, potentially causing disruptions in HR records and leave management.
*   **Information Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to the names of all system users, which could be leveraged for further attacks or social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `data.php` file through a web browser or other HTTP clients without logging in.  The provided link indicates the file can be reached via `http://192.168.0.106/general/hr/setting/attendance/newLeave/add.html` which will invoke the vulnerable `data.php` file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Tongda OA instance. No prior login or credentials are required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Tongda OA versions v11.2 to v11.6.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is related to HR settings, specifically leave and attendance.
*   The Github issue provides images that demonstrate the vulnerability by modifying annual leave data, which is called by `general/hr/setting/attention/newLeave/add.html`, and by viewing a list of system users.
