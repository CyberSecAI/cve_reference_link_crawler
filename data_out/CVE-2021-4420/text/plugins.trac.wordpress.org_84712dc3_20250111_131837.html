  | 78 |  | ~~If you're having trouble getting things set up, we offer a hosted version of Sell Media through our [VisualSociety.com](https://visualsociety.com) platform. There are many additional features found at VisualSociety.com.~~ |
  | 79 |  |  |
  | 80 | 71 | = Can I sell photo prints in addition to downloads? = |
  | 81 | 72 |  |
  | 82 |  | Yes, the~~re are two ways to do this: 1) [VisualSociety.com](https://visualsociety.com) includes print fulfillment by the world's best photo printers. 2) The~~ [Reprints extension](https://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media-reprints/) allows you to sell prints, but you are responsible for fulfilling the order.

  | 83 | 74 |  |
  | 84 | 75 | = I have 5k+ photos I would like to sell, can Sell Media handle this? = |
  | 85 | 76 |  |
  | 86 |  | Sell Media is a plugin for WordPress and WordPress can easily handle hundreds or thousands of files. That said, the number of images that can be bulk uploaded at once is largely related to server performance. If you are using a cheap, shared web host, then you will need to contact them and ask them to change [PHP settings] (http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php). |

  | 120 |  | 2. Assign each item to a specific Collection and the items will be displayed on that specific collection's archive page. You can then link to the collection like this: http://example.com/collection/my-collection-name/. A list of collecitons also shows up on the Appearance -> Menus page so you can add them to any menu. |

  | 84 | 75 | = I have 5k+ photos I would like to sell, can Sell Media handle this? = |
  | 85 | 76 |  |
  | 86 |  | Sell Media is a plugin for WordPress and WordPress can easily handle hundreds or thousands of files. That said, the number of images that can be bulk uploaded at once is largely related to server performance. If you are using a cheap, shared web host, then you will need to contact them and ask them to change [PHP settings] (http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php). |
