- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Five Star Restaurant Menu Plugin versions <= 2.4.6 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to execute unwanted actions under the current authentication of a higher privileged user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through CSRF, where a malicious actor forces a logged-in user to perform actions they didn't intend to perform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user (with higher privileges) to initiate a request which they did not intend. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
