CVE ID: CVE-2024-25228

Title: Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability in ManoeuvreHandler.class.php of Vinchin Backup & Recovery
Versions 7.2 and Earlier

Description:
A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in the `getVerifydiyResult` function within the
`ManoeuvreHandler.class.php` file of Vinchin Backup & Recovery software, affecting versions 7.2 and earlier. This
function, intended for validating IP addresses or web resources, is vulnerable to authenticated command injection due
to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

Function Analysis:
- The function accepts an input array `$params`, focusing on the `type` and `value` keys.
- Based on the `type`, it attempts to validate the input using either `verifyPing` (for IP addresses) or `verifyWeb`
(for web resources).
- The vulnerability specifically lies in the `verifyPing` method, where the `exec` function is used to execute a `ping`
command with the user-supplied `value`, without proper validation or sanitization.

Exploitation Risk:
Authenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious commands into the `value` parameter. When
processed by the vulnerable function, these commands can be executed on the server, leading to unauthorized access or
control.

Current Status:
As of the latest available information, no patch has been released for this vulnerability in versions 7.2 and earlier
of Vinchin Backup & Recovery. The vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability.

Recommendation:
Users are advised to apply strict access controls to mitigate the risk posed by this vulnerability until an official
patch is released. Monitoring for any updates from Vinchin regarding this issue is also recommended.
