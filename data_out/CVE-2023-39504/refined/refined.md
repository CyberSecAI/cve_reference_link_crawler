- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of OXPS files within PDF-XChange Editor. This lack of proper validation can lead to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in information disclosure. Attackers could potentially leverage this vulnerability alongside other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious OXPS file. User interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious OXPS file that, when parsed by the vulnerable software, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
