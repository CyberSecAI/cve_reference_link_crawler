- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'playground.wordpress.net' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DOM-Based Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute if a user clicks a malicious link crafted by the attacker. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the 'playground.wordpress.net' parameter, and then tricking a user into clicking a malicious link containing the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication and can be remote. The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on the malicious crafted link.
