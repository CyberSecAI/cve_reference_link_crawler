{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The mini-app 'KUKURUDELI' on Line exposes the 'client secret' in the client-side response to the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (client secret) in a client-side response",
      "Improper access control as the client secret is not meant to be accessible on the client side",
       "Insufficient protection of the communication channel as the access token can be obtained by exploiting the leaked client secret"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain the channel access token by utilizing the leaked client secret which can be used to broadcast malicious messages through the Line application. These messages can include website links and fraud information, affecting any user of the 'KUKURUDELI' mini-app.",
    "attack_vectors": "The client secret is exposed in the response to a specific HTTP request when the 'KUKURUDELI' mini-app is opened, allowing an attacker to intercept this response. An attacker can then use the leaked secret to request a channel access token.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to have the Line application installed and open the ‘KUKURUDELI’ mini-app. The attacker needs to be able to view network traffic, or otherwise access the response from the HTTP request mentioned."
