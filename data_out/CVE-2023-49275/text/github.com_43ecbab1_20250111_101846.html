# Multiple NULL Pointer Dereferences in wazuh-analysisd

High

[vikman90](/vikman90)
published
GHSA-4mq7-w9r6-9975
Apr 19, 2024

## Package

wazuh-manager
(deb)

## Affected versions

>= 3.2.0

## Patched versions

>= 4.7.1

wazuh-manager
(rpm)

>= 3.2.0

>= 4.7.1

## Description

### Summary

A NULL pointer dereference was detected during fuzzing of the analysis engine, allowing malicious clients to DoS the analysis engine.

### Details

The bug occurs when `analysisd` receives a syscollector message with the `hotfix` `msg_type` but lacking a `timestamp`.

It uses `cJSON_GetObjectItem()` to get the `timestamp` object item and dereferences it without checking for a `NULL` value.

[wazuh/src/analysisd/decoders/syscollector.c](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/e1d5231b31b68a75f3b8b33f833155b362411078/src/analysisd/decoders/syscollector.c#L1573)

### PoC

The bug can be reproduced with the servers default configuration. For example by using the docker single-node deployment.

To test if it is possible to trigger the bug from remote, I used a patched version of the linux client-agent.

The agent sends the following package:

`d:syscollector:{"type":"hotfix","ID":100,"hotfix":"hotfix-version-test"}`

Which gets passed to `DecodeSyscollector` as:

`d:[003] (e7e56eb7c9ee) any->syscollector:{"type":"hotfix","ID":100,"hotfix":"hotfix-version-test"}`

Resulting in a `Segmentation fault (core dumped)` after a few seconds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
