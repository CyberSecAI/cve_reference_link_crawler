The GiveWP â€“ Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.13.0 via the 'handleRequest' function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with GiveWP Worker-level access and above, to delete and update arbitrary posts.
