# Unauthorised granting of administrator privilieges over arbitrary teams under certain circumstances

High

GHSA-6m7p-gh9f-5mgg
Oct 1, 2024

## Package

elabftw

## Affected versions

>= 4.6.0

## Patched versions

5.1.0

## Description

# Advisory

In the context of eLabFTW, an [administrator](https://doc.elabftw.net/admin-guide.html#general-overview) is a user account with certain privileges to manage users and content in their assigned team/teams. A user may be an administrator in one team and a regular user in another. The vulnerability allows a regular user to become administrator of a team where they are a member, under a reasonable configuration. Additionally, in eLabFTW versions subsequent to v5.0.0, the vulnerability may allow an initially unauthenticated user to gain administrative privileges over an arbitrary team. The vulnerability does not affect system administrator status.

### Indicators

Users who were administrators of the affected team will receive a notification when logging in. Actions such as user creation and status change will be visible in audit logs in versions supporting this.

### Mitigation

Users should upgrade to version 5.1.0.

System administrators are advised to turn off local user registration, saml\_team\_create and not allow administrators to import users into teams, unless strictly required.

### Credit

The issue was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Anders Märak Leffler ([@anargam](https://github.com/anargam)).

### References

For a more complete and precise discussion of user roles, see the [eLabFTW documentation](https://doc.elabftw.net/index.html).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
