Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, March 26, 2024

The Stable channel has been updated to 123.0.6312.86/.87 for Windows and Mac and 123.0.6312.86 to Linux which will roll out over the coming days/weeks. A full list of changes in this build is available in the [Log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/123.0.6312.58..123.0.6312.87?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards
*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [7](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:1-M123) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$10000][[327807820](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/327807820)] Critical CVE-2024-2883: Use after free in ANGLE. Reported by Cassidy Kim(@cassidy6564) on 2024-03-03

[TBD][[328958020](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/328958020)] High CVE-2024-2885: Use after free in Dawn. Reported by wgslfuzz on 2024-03-11

[N/A][[330575496](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/330575496)] High CVE-2024-2886: Use after free in WebCodecs. Reported by Seunghyun Lee (@0x10n) of KAIST Hacking Lab, via Pwn2Own 2024 on 2024-03-21

[N/A][[330588502](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/330588502)] High CVE-2024-2887: Type Confusion in WebAssembly. Reported by Manfred Paul, via Pwn2Own 2024 on 2024-03-21

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[331221727](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/331221727)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/), [libFuzzer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/testing/libfuzzer/README.md), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl)

# CVE-2024-2887: A Pwn2Own Winning Bug in Google Chrome

May 02, 2024 | Guest Blogger

[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/rss/)

*In this guest blog from Master of Pwn winner Manfred Paul, he details CVE-2024-2887 – a type confusion bug that occurs in both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium). He used this bug as a part of his winning exploit that led to code execution in the renderer of both browsers. This bug was quickly patched by both* [*Google*](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html) *and* [*Microsoft*](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-2887)*. Manfred has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability and how he exploited it at the contest.*

---

In this blog, I describe a means of exploiting the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine to gain execution of arbitrary shellcode inside the renderer process. This includes a bypass of the V8 memory sandbox ([Ubercage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit#heading=h.xzptrog8pyxf)), though code execution is still constrained by the process isolation-based browser sandbox. For demonstration purposes, this limitation can be removed by running the browser with the `--no- sandbox` flag.

**Root Cause of the WebAssembly Universal Type Confusion**

A WebAssembly module may contain a `type` section that defines a list of custom “heap types”. In the base specification, this is used only to declare function types, but with the adoption of the garbage collection (GC) [proposal](https://webassembly.github.io/gc/core/_download/WebAssembly.pdf) [PDF], this section can additionally define struct types, allowing for the use of composite, heap-allocated types in WebAssembly.

Normally, a struct declared in this section may only reference structs that precede it (structs with a lower type index). To support mutually recursive data structures, a feature called recursive type groups is available. Instead of declaring the (potentially) mutually recursive types as individual entries in the type section, a recursive group is declared as a single type section entry. Within this group, individual types are declared, which are thereby allowed to reference each other.

With this in mind, consider the function responsible for parsing the `type` section from the binary WebAssembly format in `v8/src/wasm/module-decoder-impl.h`:

At (1), the limit `kV8MaxWasmTypes` (currently equal to 1,000,000) is passed as a maximum to `consume_count()`, ensuring that at most this many entries are read from the `type` section. When recursive type groups were added, this check became insufficient. While this code will permit only `kV8MaxWasmTypes` entries of the `type` section to be read, each of those can potentially be a recursive type group containing more than one individual type definition.

This insufficiency was clearly noticed at the time of this change, as together with recursive type groups a second check was added at (2). Here, for each recursive type group, it is checked that the addition of the constituent types would not exceed the `kV8MaxWasmTypes` limit.

However, this second check is still not enough. While it protects the indices of each type allocated inside a recursive group, the presence of those groups also has implications for types declared outside this group, as each recursive group adds to the total count of declared types.

To make this clearer, imagine a type section consisting of two entries: one recursive group containing`kV8MaxWasmTypes` entries, and following that group, one non-recursive type. The check at (1) is passed, as the section only has two entries. While processing the recursive group, the check at (2) is also passed, as the section has exactly `kV8MaxWasmTypes` entries. For the following single type, there is no further check: at (3) the type is simply allocated at the next free index. In this case, the index will be `kV8MaxWasmTypes`, exceeding the usual maximum of `kV8MaxWasmTypes-1`. If there were more than one non-recursive type at the end of the `type` section, they would similarly get assigned `kV8MaxWasmTypes+1`, `kV8MaxWasmTypes+2`, and so forth, as type indices.

**Impact of the Root Cause**

Exceeding the maximal number of declared heap types might seem like a very harmless resource exhaustion bug at first. However, due to some internal details of how V8 handles WebAssembly heap types, it directly allows constructing some very powerful exploit primitives.

In `v8/src/wasm/value-type.h`, the encoding of heap types is defined:

Here, V8 assumes that all user-defined heap types will be assigned indices smaller than `kV8MaxWasmTypes`. Larger indices are reserved for fixed, internal heap types (beginning with `kFunc`). This results in our own type declarations aliasing one of these internal types, leading to many opportunities for type confusion.

**Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion**

To leverage this encoding ambiguity into a full type confusion, let’s first consider the `struct.new` opcode, which produces a reference to a new struct created from fields given on the stack. The caller specifies the desired struct type by passing its type index. The relevant check on the type index can be found in `v8/src/wasm/function-body-decoder-impl.h`:

Following the validation logic into the `has_struct()` method from `v8/src/wasm/wasm-module.h`:

Since we can make `types.size()` exceed the usual limit of `kV8MaxWasmTypes`, we can make the check pass even if when passing an index larger than this value. This allows us to create a reference of an arbitrary internal type that points to the struct we can freely define.

On the other hand, consider now the handling of the `ref.cast` instruction:

Here, a `type` check elimination is performed. If `TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds` returns true, then no actual `type` check is emitted and the value is simply reinterpreted as the target `type`.

The function `TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds` ultimately calls `IsHeapSubtypeOfImpl` defined in `v8/src/wasm/wasm-subtyping.cc`:

This means that if our declared type index aliases the constant `HeapType::kNone`, the type check will always be elided if we cast to any non-function, non-external reference. In combination, we can use this to turn any reference type into any other by the following steps:

1. In the type section, define a structure type with a single field of type `anyref`, and make this struct have a type index equal to `HeapType::kNone` using the bug described above.
2. Place a non-null reference value of any type on the top of the stack and call `struct.new` with the type index set to `HeapType::kNone`. This will succeed, as `has_struct()` validates the index against the index established via the previous step.
3. Also, declare a struct with a normal type index lower than `kV8MaxWasmTypes` with a single field of the target reference type. Call `ref.cast` with this this struct’s type index. The engine will not perform any type check, as the input value is at this point understood to be reference type `HeapType::kNone`.
4. Finally, read back the reference stored in the struct by executing `struct.get`.

This arbitrary casting of reference types allows transmuting any value type into any other by referencing it, changing the reference type, and then dereferencing it – a universal type confusion.

In particular, this directly contains nearly all usual JavaScript engine exploitation primitives as special cases:

• Transmuting `int` to `int*` and then dereferencing results in an arbitrary read.

• Transmuting `int` to `int*` and then writing to that reference results in an arbitrary write.

• Transmuting `externref`to `int` is the `addrOf()` primitive, obtaining the address of a JavaScript object.

• Transmuting `int` to `externref` is the `fakeObj()` primitive, forcing the engine to treat an arbitrary value as a pointer to a JavaScript object.

While casting from `HeapType::kNone` to an `externref` is not allowed, remember that we are actually operating on one more level of indirection - transmuting to `externref` involves casting to a reference to a struct containing one `externref` member.

Note however that these “arbitrary” reads and writes are still contained in the V8 memory sandbox, as all involved pointers to heap-allocated structures are tagged, compressed pointers inside the heap cage, not full 64-bit raw pointers.

**Integer Underflow Leading to V8 Sandbox Escape**

The primitives described above allow for freely manipulating and faking most JavaScript objects. However, all of this happens inside the limited memory space of the V8 sandbox. “Trusted” objects such as WebAssembly instance data cannot yet be manipulated. We will now turn our attention to a bug that can be used to escape the memory sandbox.

An often-used object for JavaScript engine exploits is `ArrayBuffer` and its corresponding views, (i.e. typed arrays), as it allows for direct, untagged access to some region of memory.

To prevent access to pointers outside the V8 sandbox, sandboxed pointers are used to designate a typed array’s corresponding backing store. Similarly, an ArrayBuffer’s length field is always loaded as a “bounded size access”, inherently limiting its value to a maximum of 235 − 1.

However, in modern JavaScript, the handling of typed arrays has become quite complex due to the introduction of resizable ArrayBuffers (RABs) and their sharable variant, growable SharedArrayBuffers (GSABs). Both variants feature the ability to change their length after the object has been created with the shared variant being restricted to never shrink. In particular, for typed arrays with these kinds of buffers, the array length can never be cached and must be recomputed on each access.

Additionally, ArrayBuffers also feature an offset field, describing the start of the data in the
actual underlying backing store. This offset must be taken into account when computing the length.

Let’s now look at the code responsible for building a TypedArray’s length access in the optimizing Turbofan compiler. It can be found in `v8/src/compiler/graph-assembler.cc`. Note that most non-RAB/GSAB cases and the code responsible for dispatching are omitted for simplicity:

For arrays backed by a resizable ArrayBuffer, we can see at (1) that the length is computed as `floor((byte_length - byte_offset) / element_size)`. Crucially, there is an underflow check. If `byte_offset` exceeds `byte_length`, then 0 is returned instead.

Curiously though, in the case of a GSAB-backed array, the corresponding underflow check is missing. Thus, if `byte_offset` is larger than `byte_length`, an underflow occurs and the subtraction wraps around to something close to the maximum unsigned 64-bit integer 264. As both of these fields are found in the (by now) attacker-controlled array object, we can easily trigger this using the sandboxed arbitrary read/write primitives discussed previously. This results in access to the whole 64-bit address space, as the length computed by this function is used to bound any typed array accesses (in JIT-compiled code).

**Exploitation for Arbitrary Shellcode Execution**

Using the two bugs described above, exploitation becomes fairly straightforward. The primitives described in the Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion section directly give arbitrary reads and writes within the V8 memory sandbox. This can then be used to manipulate a growable `SharedArrayBuffer` to have an offset greater than its length. A previously JIT-compiled read/write function can then be used to access and overwrite data anywhere in the process’s address space. An appropriate target for overwrite is the compiled code of a `WebAssembly` module, since that resides in an RWX (read-write-execute) page and can be overwritten with shellcode.
