- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper CSRF protection in the `memberOnline_deal.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete user data by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, by tricking an authenticated administrator into submitting the malicious form.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a crafted HTML page containing a form that makes a request to the vulnerable `memberOnline_deal.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page that will be visited by an authenticated user and trick them into submitting the form, which will result in the request being sent to the vulnerable endpoint.
