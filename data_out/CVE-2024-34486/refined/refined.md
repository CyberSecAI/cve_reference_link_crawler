- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `OFPPacketQueue.parser` method in `ryu/ofproto/ofproto_v1_3_parser.py` (and similar files in other versions), enters an infinite loop when parsing `OFPQueueProp` if `OFPQueueProp.len` is 0. The loop condition depends on `length` and `offset` being incremented by `queue_prop.len`. When `queue_prop.len` is 0, these variables are not updated, causing an infinite loop.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper handling of a zero-length `OFPQueueProp` within the parsing logic of `OFPPacketQueue`. The code doesn't check for a zero-length and proceeds to use it in a loop condition causing an infinite loop.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability will cause the Ryu controller to become unresponsive due to an infinite loop in the parsing logic, effectively leading to a denial of service (DoS).

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted OpenFlow message containing a `OFPPacketQueue` with `OFPQueueProp` that has a length of 0.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send OpenFlow messages to the Ryu controller. This would typically involve having network connectivity to the controller or being able to inject messages into the network the controller monitors.
