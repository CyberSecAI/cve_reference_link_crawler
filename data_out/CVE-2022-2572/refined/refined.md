Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2572:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly invalidate API keys associated with disabled or deleted users when access is revoked via an external authentication provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** API keys of disabled or deleted users remain active even after their access has been revoked through an external auth provider.
- The system fails to properly synchronize the user's status with the validity of their API keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who had their access revoked via an external authentication provider can still use their old API key to access the system and potentially perform actions within the scope of their previous permissions, even if their user account has been disabled or deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must have previously held a valid user account with access to Octopus Server.
- The attacker must have obtained an API key while their account was active.
- The user's access must have been revoked through an external authentication provider.
- The attacker can then use the old API key to access the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have been a legitimate user who was subsequently disabled or deleted.
- The attacker must possess the old API key.

**Affected Versions:**
- All 3.x versions after 3.5
- All 4.x versions
- All 2018.x, 2019.x, 2020.x and 2021.x versions
