Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2017-3457:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from both `www.oracle.com` and `access.redhat.com` includes mentions of `CVE-2017-3457` in the context of MySQL server vulnerabilities. Therefore, the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability (from Oracle):**

*   The `www.oracle.com` document identifies `CVE-2017-3457` as a vulnerability within the "Server: DML" component of MySQL Server. This suggests a problem related to how the server handles Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the Data Manipulation Language (DML) handling of the MySQL server.
*   The `access.redhat.com` document lists several CVEs fixed in a MySQL update, which includes CVE-2017-3457, all relating to various MySQL server components. This highlights a range of weaknesses addressed in that update.
*   The Red Hat advisory also states "This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server. Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory pages listed in the References section".

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The `www.oracle.com` document indicates an availability impact, but confidentiality and integrity are low.
*   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 4.9, which is a medium-severity score.
*   `access.redhat.com` states a security impact of "Important" for the update including CVE-2017-3457.
*   Based on the CVSS score and the `www.oracle.com` impact assessments, this vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to cause a denial of service.
*   The Red Hat advisory also notes that several vulnerabilities fixed in this update could allow a remote attacker to crash the server or execute arbitrary shell commands, depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the network via the MySQL protocol.
*   The Red Hat advisory suggests a remote attacker with access to the MySQL port may exploit it.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The `www.oracle.com` document indicates that no authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, but the `access.redhat.com` content specifies "An unauthenticated remote attacker with access to the MySQL port".
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MySQL server.
*   It is implied that the attacker has a general understanding of database operations and the ability to craft malicious DML requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `access.redhat.com` document provides a more detailed overview, highlighting that a variety of vulnerabilities were fixed in that update, and some might allow arbitrary code execution.
*   The advisory emphasizes the importance of updating MySQL installations promptly.
*   The Red Hat advisory also mentions the specific fix in rh-mysql57-mysql package addresses the vulnerability.
*   The Red Hat advisory states “A database user with privileges to create databases or tables could cause the mysql command to execute arbitrary shell or SQL commands while restoring database backup created using the mysqldump tool”. This suggests that while not directly related to CVE-2017-3457, that another vulnerability related to MySQL allowed arbitrary shell command execution.

In summary, CVE-2017-3457 represents a vulnerability within the DML handling of MySQL that can potentially lead to a denial-of-service, if exploited successfully. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without authentication, which increases the risk.
