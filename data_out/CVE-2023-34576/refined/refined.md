- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `updatepos.php` script in the Opart Faq module for PrestaShop has a vulnerable SQL call that is executed with user-supplied data without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker only needs network access to send malicious HTTP requests.
