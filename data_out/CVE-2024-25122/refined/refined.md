Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied parameters in the `sidekiq-unique-jobs` web UI. Specifically, the `filter`, `count`, `cursor`, and `prev_cursor` parameters in the `/changelogs`, `/locks`, and `/expiring_locks` endpoints, and the `digest` parameter in the `/locks/:digest` and `/locks/:digest/delete` endpoints were not being sanitized before being rendered in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the application through crafted URL parameters.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** In certain scenarios, specifically with the `count` parameter, the injection could lead to a server error (status 500) which could potentially be used for uncontrolled resource consumption.
- **Lack of Default Authorization:** The admin web UI is not protected by any authorization constraint by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session when they visit a crafted link. This could lead to:
    - Stealing of cookies, session data, and local storage data.
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
    - Defacement of the web interface.
- **Resource Consumption:** By triggering application errors with crafted inputs, an attacker could potentially cause resource exhaustion, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL Parameters:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs with specific query parameters and trick a user to click the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
- They either need to trick a super-user into clicking the link or compromise a super-user's account.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server in the default configuration as no authorization is configured by default.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is similar to a previously patched vulnerability in the `sidekiq` gem, but it is a distinct vulnerability in a related but different project (`sidekiq-unique-jobs`).
- The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The fix involves sanitizing the vulnerable parameters using the `h()` method (likely HTML escaping).
- It's recommended that users of the library configure authorization constraints on the admin UI.
- It's also recommended to run the UI on a sandboxed subdomain to prevent leaking sensitive data if an XSS vulnerability is exploited.
