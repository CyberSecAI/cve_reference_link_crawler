- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PAR file.
