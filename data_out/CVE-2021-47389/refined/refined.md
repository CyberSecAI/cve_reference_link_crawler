Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-47389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing `sev_decommission` call in the `sev_receive_start` function within the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) module for AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) feature.
- According to the AMD SEV API, the `RECEIVE_START` command generates a new guest context and requires a corresponding `DECOMMISSION` call to release resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Resource Leak:**  If the binding of an ASID (Address Space Identifier) fails after `RECEIVE_START`, the SEV guest context is not decommissioned. This leads to a memory leak in the firmware.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The code failed to properly handle the error case when `sev_bind_asid` failed after calling `RECEIVE_START`, resulting in the missing decommission call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SEV Launch Failures:** The memory leak caused by the missing `sev_decommission` can accumulate over time. Eventually the firmware might be unable to allocate new SEV guest contexts, leading to subsequent failures when trying to launch SEV-enabled virtual machines.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by initiating a `KVM_SEV_RECEIVE_START` command, which attempts to create a new SEV guest context. Specifically, the failure occurs when the ASID binding fails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a virtual machine and to trigger the KVM ioctl `KVM_SEV_RECEIVE_START`, which requires capabilities to interact with the KVM API.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the ASID binding to fail after RECEIVE\_START.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes the patch for the vulnerability.
- This issue is similar to a previous bug that was fixed for LAUNCH\_START.
- The fix adds the missing `sev_decommission` call in the error path when `sev_bind_asid` fails, preventing the resource leak.
