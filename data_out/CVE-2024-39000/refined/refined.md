The provided content is related to **CVE-2024-38997**, not CVE-2024-39000, and describes a prototype pollution vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `extendDefaults` and `parse` functions in the `@adolph_dudu/ratio-swiper` package not properly sanitizing or validating user-provided input, leading to prototype pollution. Specifically, the functions process arguments in a way that allows an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property, thereby modifying the base `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation in `extendDefaults` and `parse` functions.
- Inability to prevent modification of `Object.prototype` using the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can modify built-in `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to:
    - Denial of service (DoS) by disrupting application logic or causing crashes.
    - Remote code execution (RCE) if there are gadgets that use the polluted prototype properties.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected properties affect user-facing content or JavaScript execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By calling the vulnerable functions `extendDefaults` and `parse` with a crafted argument containing a `__proto__` property.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to pass data to the vulnerable functions (`extendDefaults, parse`). This typically requires the ability to control inputs or arguments passed to these functions during the application's execution.
