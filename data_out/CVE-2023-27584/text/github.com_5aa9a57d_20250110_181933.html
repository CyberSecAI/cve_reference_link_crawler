Dragonfly v2.0.9 is released! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Thanks to the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) Team, [Volcano Engine](https://www.volcengine.com/) Team, and [Baidu AI Cloud](https://intl.cloud.baidu.com/) Team for helping Dragonfly integrate with their public clouds. Welcome to visit [d7y.io](https://d7y.io) website.

## Features

* Download tasks based on priority. `Priority` can be passed as parameter during the download task, or can be associated with priority in the application of the Manager console, refer to [priority protoc definition](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/api/blob/main/pkg/apis/common/v2/common.proto#L74).
* Scheduler adds `PieceDownloadTimeout` parameter, which indicates that if the piece download times out, the scheduler will change the task state to `TaskStateFailed`.
* Add [health service](/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/v2.0.9/google.golang.org/grpc/health) to each GRPC service.
* Add [reflection](/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/blob/v2.0.9/google.golang.org/grpc/reflection) to each GRPC service.
* Manager supports redis sentinal model.
* Refactor `dynconfig` package to remove `json.Unmarshal`, improving its runtime efficiency.
* Fix panic caused by hashring not being built.
* Previously, most of the pieces were downloaded from the same parent. Now, different pieces are downloaded from different parents to improve download efficiency and distribute bandwidth among multiple parents.
* If Manager's searcher can not found candidate scheduler clusters, It will return all the clusters for peers to check health. If check health is successful, the scheduler cluster can be used.
* Support [ORAS](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) source client to pull image.
* Add UDP ping package and GRPC protoc definition for building virtual network topology.
* The [V2 P2P protocol](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/api/tree/main/proto) has been added, and both Scheduler and Manager have implemented the API of the [V2 P2P protocol](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/api/tree/main/proto), in preparation for the future Rust version of Dfdaemon.
* OSS source client supports STS access, user can set security token in header.
* Dynconfig supports to resolve addresses with health service.
* Add `hostTTL` and `hostGCInterval` in Scheduler to prevent information of abnormally exited Dfdaemon from becoming dirty data in the Scheduler.
* Add [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) to searcher to provide more precise scheduler cluster selection for Dfdaemon.
* Refactor the metric definitions for the V1 P2P protocol and add the metric definitions for the V2 P2P protocol. Additionally, reorganize the [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?search=dragonfly), refer to [monitoring](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/monitoring).

## Break Change

* Using the default value for the key used to generate JWT tokens in Manager can lead to [security issues](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/security/advisories/GHSA-hpc8-7wpm-889w). Therefore, Manager has added [JWT Key](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/pull/2161) in the configuration, and upgrading Manager requires generating a new JWT Key and [setting it in the Manager configuration](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/d7y.io/blob/main/docs/reference/configuration/manager.md?plain=1#L56).
