The provided content relates to CVE-2023-27584.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded secret key ("Secret Key") in the JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation within the Dragonfly2 Manager component. This key is used to sign and verify JWTs, which are used for user authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The most critical weakness is the presence of a hardcoded secret key in the application's source code. This exposes the system to authentication bypass.
- **Predictable authentication:** Because the secret key is hardcoded and publicly known from the source code, anyone can generate valid JWT tokens.
- **Authentication bypass:**  The hardcoded key enables unauthorized access to the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete access:** An attacker can forge JWT tokens and bypass authentication, effectively gaining administrative privileges and control over the system.
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker can perform any action as a user with admin privileges potentially leading to data breaches or data corruption.
- **System takeover:** An attacker with admin privileges can cause significant disruption to the services.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs knowledge of the hardcoded secret key. This key is available in the source code of the application.
- The attacker needs network access to the service using the vulnerable JWT implementation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dragonfly2 versions <= 2.0.8
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8, which is considered critical.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-hpc8-7wpm-889w.
- The fix involves allowing the JWT key to be configurable instead of hardcoded. This was done in commit [2161](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly2/pull/2161).
- The advisory mentions that a new JWT key must be generated and set in the manager configuration after upgrading.
