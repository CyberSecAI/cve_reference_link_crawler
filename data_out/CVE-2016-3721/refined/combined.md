# CloudBees Security Advisory 2016-05-11

**Revised 2016-05-12:\*\***Added CJP-4586​\*\*

This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins, and a vulnerability in CloudBees Operations Center Context Plugin.

[#### Arbitrary build parameters are passed to build scripts as environment variables](#arbitrary-build-parameters-are-passed-to-build-scripts-as-environment-variables)

**SECURITY-170 / CVE-2016-3721**

Build parameters in Jenkins typically are passed to build scripts as environment variables. Some plugins allow passing arbitrary (undeclared) parameters. Depending on access permissions and installed plugins, malicious users were able to trigger builds, passing arbitrary environment variables (e.g. PATH) to modify the behavior of those builds. Rather than expect all plugin authors to be aware of this potential problem, Jenkins now filters the build parameters based on what is defined on the job.

As this change is known to affect a number of plugins, it's possible to restore the previous behavior by setting the system property *hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters* to *true* . **This is potentially very unsafe** and intended as a short-term workaround only.

To allow specific, known safe parameter names to be passed to builds, set the system property *hudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters* to a comma-separated list of safe parameter names. Example:

```
java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=FOO,BAR_BAZ,qux -jar jenkins.war
```
[#### Malicious users with multiple user accounts can prevent other users from logging in](#malicious-users-with-multiple-user-accounts-can-prevent-other-users-from-logging-in)

**SECURITY-243 / CVE-2016-3722**

By changing the freely editable 'full name', malicious users with multiple user accounts could prevent other users from logging in, as 'full name' was resolved before actual user name to determine which account is currently trying to log in.

[#### Information on installed plugins exposed via API](#information-on-installed-plugins-exposed-via-api)

**SECURITY-250 / CVE-2016-3723**

The XML/JSON API endpoints providing information about installed plugins were missing permissions checks, allowing any user with read access to Jenkins to determine which plugins and versions were installed.

[#### Encrypted secrets (e.g. passwords) were leaked to users with permission to read configuration](#encrypted-secrets-eg-passwords-were-leaked-to-users-with-permission-to-read-configuration)

**SECURITY-266 / CVE-2016-3724**

Users with extended read access could access encrypted secrets stored directly in the configuration of those items.

As a side-effect of this change, copying a job that contains secrets in its configuration now requires the Configure permission on that job.

[#### Regular users can trigger download of update site metadata](#regular-users-can-trigger-download-of-update-site-metadata)

**SECURITY-273 / CVE-2016-3725**

A missing permissions check allowed any user with access to Jenkins to trigger an update of update site metadata. This could be combined with DNS cache poisoning to disrupt Jenkins service.

[#### Open redirect to scheme-relative URLs](#open-redirect-to-scheme-relative-urls)

**SECURITY-276 / CVE-2016-3726**

Some Jenkins URLs did not properly validate the redirect URLs, which allowed malicious users to create URLs that redirect users to arbitrary scheme-relative URLs.

[#### Granting the permission to read node configurations allows access to overall system configuration](#granting-the-permission-to-read-node-configurations-allows-access-to-overall-system-configuration)

**SECURITY-281 / CVE-2016-3727**

The API URL */computer/(master)/api/xml* allowed users with the 'extended read' permission for the master node to see some global Jenkins configuration, including the configuration of the security realm.

This URL now unconditionally sends HTTP 400 Bad Request when accessed. There is no workaround.

[#### Users without permission to configure a job could copy and promote it](#users-without-permission-to-configure-a-job-could-copy-and-promote-it)

**CJP-4586**

CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center allows copying, moving and promoting items between Jenkins instances. Permissions weren’t checked correctly, so that users without permission to configure the source item and/or its child items could act on it, both gaining access to previously inaccessible child items, as well as resulting in secret disclosure similar to SECURITY-266.

### Severity

* SECURITY-170 is considered medium.
* SECURITY -243 is considered low.
* SECURITY -250 is considered medium.
* SECURITY -266 is considered medium.
* SECURITY -273 is considered low.
* SECURITY -276 is considered medium.
* SECURITY -281 is considered medium.
* CJP-4586 is considered low.
### Fix

* CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center 1.625.x.y should be upgraded to 1.625.18.1
* CloudBees Jenkins Operations Center 1.609.x.y should be upgraded to 1.609.18.1
* CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise 1.642.x.y should be upgraded to 1.642.18.1
* CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise 1.625.x.y should be upgraded to 1.625.18.1
* CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise 1.609.x.y should be upgraded to 1.609.18.1
* Operations Center Context Plugin 1.7.x should be upgraded to 1.7.108
* Operations Center Context Plugin 1.8.x should be upgraded to 1.8.18
* Jenkins LTS should be upgraded to 1.651.2
* Jenkins main line should be upgraded to Jenkins 2.3
* DEV@cloud is already protected

All previous releases are affected by these vulnerabilities.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2016-05-11

**Revised 2016-05-12**: Added note on plugins impacted by SECURITY-170, mentioned system property disabling part of the SECURITY-243 fix.

---

This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

## Description

### Arbitrary build parameters are passed to build scripts as environment variables

**SECURITY-170 / CVE-2016-3721**

Build parameters in Jenkins typically are passed to build scripts as environment variables. Some plugins allow passing arbitrary (undeclared) parameters. Depending on access permissions and installed plugins, malicious users were able to trigger builds, passing arbitrary environment variables (e.g. PATH) to modify the behavior of those builds. Rather than expect all plugin authors to be aware of this potential problem, Jenkins now filters the build parameters based on what is defined on the job.

As this change is known to affect a number of plugins, it’s possible to restore the previous behavior by setting the system property `hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters` to `true`. **This is potentially very unsafe** and intended as a short-term workaround only.

To allow specific, known safe parameter names to be passed to builds, set the system property `hudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters` to a comma-separated list of safe parameter names. Example:

```
java -Dhudson.model.ParametersAction.safeParameters=FOO,BAR_BAZ,qux -jar jenkins.war
```

|  | For an overview of impacted plugins and the current status of their fixes, see: [Plugins affected by fix for SECURITY-170](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins%2Baffected%2Bby%2Bfix%2Bfor%2BSECURITY-170) |
| --- | --- |

### Malicious users with multiple user accounts can prevent other users from logging in

**SECURITY-243 / CVE-2016-3722**

By changing the freely editable "full name", malicious users with multiple user accounts could prevent other users from logging in, as "full name" was resolved before actual user name to determine which account is currently trying to log in.

Part of this fix can be disabled by setting the system property `hudson.model.User.SECURITY_243_FULL_DEFENSE` to `false`. This is not generally encouraged, but may be necessary in rare circumstances.

### Information on installed plugins exposed via API

**SECURITY-250 / CVE-2016-3723**

The XML/JSON API endpoints providing information about installed plugins were missing permissions checks, allowing any user with read access to Jenkins to determine which plugins and versions were installed.

### Encrypted secrets (e.g. passwords) were leaked to users with permission to read configuration

**SECURITY-266 / CVE-2016-3724**

Users with extended read access could access encrypted secrets stored directly in the configuration of those items.

As a side-effect of this change, copying a job that contains secrets in its configuration now requires the Configure permission on that job.

### Regular users can trigger download of update site metadata

**SECURITY-273 / CVE-2016-3725**

A missing permissions check allowed any user with access to Jenkins to trigger an update of update site metadata. This could be combined with DNS cache poisoning to disrupt Jenkins service.

### Open redirect to scheme-relative URLs

**SECURITY-276 / CVE-2016-3726**

Some Jenkins URLs did not properly validate the redirect URLs, which allowed malicious users to create URLs that redirect users to arbitrary scheme-relative URLs.

### Granting the permission to read node configurations allows access to overall system configuration

**SECURITY-281 / CVE-2016-3727**

The API URL `/computer/(master)/api/xml` allowed users with the 'extended read' permission for the built-in node to see some global Jenkins configuration, including the configuration of the security realm.

This URL now unconditionally sends HTTP 400 Bad Request when accessed. There is no workaround.

## Severity

* SECURITY-170 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)**.
* SECURITY-243 is considered **[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)**.
* SECURITY-250 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)**.

SECURITY-3341 / CVE-2024-34144 (crafted constructor bodies) & CVE-2024-34145 (sandbox-defined classes)
Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low
privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally
safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are
intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the
call is to be allowed.

Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin
1335.vf07d9ce377a_e and earlier:

* Crafted constructor bodies that invoke other constructors can be used to
  construct any subclassable type via implicit casts.
* Sandbox-defined Groovy classes that shadow specific non-sandbox-defined
  classes can be used to construct any subclassable type.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run
sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection
and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

SECURITY-3342 / CVE-2024-34146
Git server Plugin 114.v068a_c7cc2574 and earlier does not perform a
permission check for read access to a Git repository over SSH.

This allows attackers with a previously configured SSH public key but
lacking Overall/Read permission to access Git repositories.

SECURITY-3294 / CVE-2024-34147
Telegram Bot Plugin 1.4.0 and earlier stores the Telegram Bot token
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`jenkinsci.plugins.telegrambot.TelegramBotGlobalConfiguration.xml` on the
Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-3331 / CVE-2024-34148
Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier
programmatically sets the Java system property
`hudson.model.ParametersAction.keepUndefinedParameters` whenever
a build is triggered from a release tag with the 'Svn-Partial
Release Manager' SCM. Doing so disables the fix for SECURITY-170
/ CVE-2016-3721.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Jenkins : Plugins affected by fix for SECURITY-170

Created by  Unknown User (orrc), last modified by  Unknown User (yafim\_kazak) on Jan 23, 2017

## Background

In a [May 2016 security advisory](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2016-05-11), a vulnerability was announced (SECURITY-170 / CVE-2016-3721) whereby attackers could potentially exploit the fact that certain Jenkins plugins allow the definition of arbitrary build parameters â which are in turn injected into the build envirionment.

The fix for this issue â which was first included in Jenkins versions 1.651.2 and Jenkins 2.3 â means that only build parameters that have been explicitly defined in a job's configuration will be available by default at build time. Any other arbitrary parameters added to a build by plugins will not be available by default.

As there are a number of plugins that rely on the behaviour in older Jenkins versions, upgrading to 1.651.2 or 2.3 means that certain build behaviours may be broken.

This page attempts to list the affected plugins, how the plugin behaves in current versions of Jenkins, and whether those plugins have been fixed to work with the new parameter filtering behaviour of Jenkins.

## Workarounds

Note that there are a couple of global workarounds to either turn off the new parameter-filtering behaviour, or to whitelist certain parameter names, preventing them from being filtered out.

These are described in the [security advisory](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2016-05-11) and in the [accompanying blog post](https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/05/11/security-update/).

## Affected plugins

Note that this list is not exhaustive. If you encounter a plugin that no longer works as expected due to the fix for SECURITY-170, please add it to the list.

**More importantly, please** **[*file a bug report*](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/How%2Bto%2Breport%2Ban%2Bissue)****, if one doesn't exist, to help ensure that the appropriate plugin maintainer is informed.**

Some items here include a list of the parameter names that they use, which could be added to the whitelist mentioned in the "Workarounds" section above.
