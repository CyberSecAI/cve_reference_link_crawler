- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FortiSIEMWindowsAgent service, specifically the AoWinAgt executable, has an unquoted service path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain elevated privileges by exploiting the unquoted service path.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited when the service starts. The lack of quotes around the service path allows a malicious executable to be placed in a directory that matches a partial path component which is then executed as the service starts, resulting in privilege escalation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to place a malicious executable in a directory along the path of the unquoted service path. The specific vector would also require a machine restart to trigger service restart.
