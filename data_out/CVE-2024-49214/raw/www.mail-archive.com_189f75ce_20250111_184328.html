<pre>Hi,

HAProxy 3.1-dev7 was released on 2024/09/05. It added 56 new commits
after version 3.1-dev6.</pre><pre>

This version collects a non-negligible number of bug fixes (16) including
the important one affecting H2+zero-copy forwarding mentioned in the 3.0
and 2.9 announcements. The other bugs that were fixed concern frozen
connections, crashes, and an issue where rate counters could be bad and
remain bad for a while in case of time jumps.

Among the changes in this version, I'm seeing:
  - support for applying a factor to byte rates in stick-tables. The issue
    is that right now the rate values are stored on 32 bits and that this
    limits measurable rates to about 34 Gbps. When this was added in 2010,
    we wouldn't imagine that users would require more than this *per key*.
    But now we're in 2024, the bwlim filter has become popular even on
    large systems where high limits need to be set. It was figured that
    the best way to address this specific (and admittedly rare) need is to
    just apply a factor to the rate stored in the stick-table. This allows
    the bwlim filter to be configured with lower values and reported rates
    to still make sense. The &quot;brates-factor&quot; configured on the stick-table
    supports a range of 1 to 1024. 1024 could imply counting kbytes per
    second instead of bytes per second. 125 could be nice to count kbit/s
    instead for example.

  - the MPTCP support from Dorian, Anthony and Mathieu was finally merged.
    MPTCP addresses can be explicitly specified using prefixes &quot;mptcp@&quot;,
    &quot;mptcp4@&quot;, &quot;mptcp6@&quot;. While writing this I'm realizing that I don't
    know if we have an easy way to know if we're dealing with an MPTCP or a
    regular TCP connection in order to feed stats. It could be interesting
    to see in logs which connections were made using this and measure how
    popular it is among clients. Hmmm maybe we can do that using one
    listener each... More things to test :-)

  - the init-state patch from Aaron was also merged. It finally allows
    a server *not* to instantly turn on upon startup or when leaving
    maintenance, but only after it succeeds its checks. There have been
    requests for this for a very long time (issue 51!), and now 4 possible
    behaviors can be configured per server. One use case I'm aware of is
    when you set a server in maintenance to upgrade it, you usually don't
    want it to instantly be reintegrated when marking it ready, instead
    you usually prefer that it performs its checks. Now it will be
    possible via the &quot;init-state&quot; server parameter.

  - a few sample fetch functions (ssl_fc_supported_versions_bin and
    ssl_fc_sigalgs_bin) were added to retrieve such information during
    the SSL handshake that are otherwise not available later.

  - the environment variables for CLF log formats were added

  - the master process now restores its initial environment before
    switching to wait mode. Indeed, previously it would re-exec itself
    using the new variables parsed in the config. An example of problem
    is if you do that in your config:

        global
            #setenv TRACE 1

        .if defined(TRACE)
            ...
        .endif

    Then once you temporarily uncomment the &quot;setenv&quot;, the TRACE variable
    is set and passed to sub-processes, then if you comment the config
    again it persists since it was inherited. This won't happen anymore
    as we now keep a copy of the environment that is restored before the
    execve(). Note that all such corner cases won't be an issue soon with
    the ongoing change of the master/worker startup sequence anyway.

  - support for &quot;retry-on 429&quot; was added.

  - QUIC: the NEW_TOKEN frame support was added so as to always be able
    to validate reachability of the client during 0-RTT. The problem was
    reported by Michael Wedl, without this a client can change its address
    between the connection establishment and a 0-RTT request, the last one
    will be used and logged (as expected). The problem is that we don't
    know if it's its real address and we need to validate it first. The
    NEW_TOKEN allows to deliver an IP-based token to the client for use
    later, and if the address changes, then we can use a regular RETRY
    token. It was tested to be OK and now works fine even in the interop.
    It was also backported to 3.0. Not sure how far it will go since it
    relies on recent infrastructure updates.

The rest is extra debug info, cleanups and typo fixes, as well as CI
updates. I'm glad that we're finally merging long-standing changes that
have been discussed for several years.

If you're running any 3.1-dev, this one should be worth an update. It
contains essentially bug fixes (including the one against the risk of
crashing the H2 mux) and all other changes are really isolated, so except
by failing on a bugfix, the risk of regression from previous versions is
much lower than the risk to fix bugs.

Given that we now have some substance for another 3.0 and that Fred spent
a good time backporting and testing the QUIC stuff, I think we'll produce
3.0.5 next week (no promise as usual). 2.9 and 2.8 are almost ready for
another shot. 2.6 should not require too much work at first glance so it
should be within reach. 2.4 and 2.2 are older and will require more work
(if fixes are needed at all, which is not even granted).

We still have roughly 3 months before the release, that's fine but that's
not a lot. As a reminder, September is usually busy for a number of us
(meetings, conferences, even releases of enterprise stuff for some), so I
expect less regular progress in the coming weeks and less time for reviews
as well. This means that sensitive stuff really needs to be prioritized so
that we still have sufficient testing time (and that includes my ongoing
work on H2 rx window). We're having a pretty nice 3.1 for now, which seems
to be in a better shape than 3.0 when it was released, I would hate to
degrade it in the last weeks, so please all keep this in mind.
