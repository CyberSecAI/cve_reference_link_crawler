Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2024-26052:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This means that malicious scripts can be injected and permanently stored within the application's data store. These scripts will be executed when other users access the affected data.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires a low level of access complexity (AC:L) and a low privilege level (PR:L) with user interaction (UI:R) which means that the attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with the injected code for the XSS to execute. The scope of the attack is changed (S:C) due to the attacker being able to inject javascript that will execute on a different context to the original request. The impact to confidentiality and integrity is low, while there is no impact to availability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low privileged attacker can inject malicious script, and needs to trick the victim user into executing the injected code for the XSS to occur.
