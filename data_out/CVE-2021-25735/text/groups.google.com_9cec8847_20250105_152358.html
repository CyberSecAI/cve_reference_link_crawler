### A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that could allow node updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook. You are only affected by this vulnerability if you run a Validating Admission Webhook for Nodes that denies admission based at least partially on the old state of the Node object.

This issue has been rated Medium ([CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)), and assigned CVE-2021-25735.

Note: This only impacts validating admission plugins that rely on old values in certain fields, and does not impact calls from kubelets that go through the built-in NodeRestriction admission plugin.

### Affected Versions

* kube-apiserver v1.20.0 - v1.20.5
* kube-apiserver v1.19.0 - v1.19.9
* kube-apiserver <= v1.18.17

### Fixed Versions

This issue is fixed in the following versions:

* kube-apiserver v1.21.0
* kube-apiserver v1.20.6
* kube-apiserver v1.19.10
* kube-apiserver v1.18.18
