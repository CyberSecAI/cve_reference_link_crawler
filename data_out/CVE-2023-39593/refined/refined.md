Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to create and load User-Defined Functions (UDFs) within MariaDB, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability exists because the database server permits loading of shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) and executing functions from them. This is a common method for extending database functionality, but becomes a security risk when attackers can upload their own malicious libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted UDF Loading:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to create and load UDFs without proper controls or restrictions. The database allows an authenticated user to load a custom shared library, which can contain malicious code.
*   **Insecure Plugin Directory:** The default plugin directory may be writable by the database user, allowing the attacker to upload their malicious library.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The database does not validate the contents of the UDF library before loading and executing.
*   **Privilege Abuse:** A database user (in this case 'root', but the exploit also works for any user with sufficient privileges) can perform actions such as creating functions and writing files to disk which should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the database service. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In many cases, the database service may run with high privileges like `NT AUTHORITY SYSTEM` on Windows, leading to system level privilege escalation.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker can read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, and potentially gain access to the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could install and execute malicious code that can cause the database service or system to crash, leading to DoS.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker can use the compromised system as a stepping stone to access other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Accessible Database:** The primary attack vector is a database server that is accessible over the network by an authenticated attacker.
*   **Database User with `CREATE FUNCTION` privilege:** The attacker requires a valid database user that has the privileges to create functions using `CREATE FUNCTION`.
*   **Ability to write to plugin directory:** The attacker needs the ability to place a malicious DLL within the database plugin directory. This could be done through a vulnerable `from_base64 into dumpfile`  or other file writing functionality if directory permissions allow it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Database Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials to connect to the database server.
*   **Privilege to Create Functions:** The attacker needs to have database privileges to create and load UDFs using `CREATE FUNCTION`.
*   **Knowledge of Database Plugin Directory:** The attacker needs to be able to determine the correct plugin directory location.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the database server to connect using a client such as `mysql`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also illustrates how to use `netcat` and `powershell` to establish reverse shells, highlighting the severity of the exploit.
*   The provided github repository contains the proof of concept code to exploit the vulnerability.
* The seclist.org content refers to an older similar exploit but it is still applicable to this vulnerability.
