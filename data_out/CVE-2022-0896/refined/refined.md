Based on the provided information, the commit `e0224462b3dd6b1f7c6ec1197413afc6019bc3b5` in the `microweber/microweber` repository includes changes to the `AdminCommentController.php` file related to comment sanitization.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant changes:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit addresses a vulnerability related to insufficient sanitization of user-provided comment bodies before they are saved to the database. Specifically, the original code was not adequately preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **XSS Vulnerability:**  The original code had weaknesses in its XSS prevention mechanisms, potentially allowing malicious users to inject JavaScript code into comments.
-   **Inadequate Sanitization:** The original sanitization process was not sufficiently robust.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **XSS attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through comments. If a user views a comment with such code, it could lead to:
    -   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    -   Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    -   Defacement: Modifying the website's appearance.
    -   Data theft: Exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Comment Submission:** An attacker would submit a comment containing malicious JavaScript code.
-   **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is within the admin panel comment management.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be a user able to post comments.
-   The attacker would likely need access to submit a comment or post a comment in the admin panel.

**Detailed changes in the commit:**

-   **Removal of unnecessary HTML cleaning:** The lines removing HTML with `$comment_body = $this->app->format->clean_html($comment_body);` and `$cleanHtml = new HTMLClean(); $comment_body = $cleanHtml->onlyTags($comment_body);` were removed.
-   **Improved XSS cleaning:** The XSS cleaning was improved, with  `$evil` array containing patterns for removing dangerous HTML attributes and elements, such as attributes starting with 'on' followed by any character, 'xmlns', 'formaction', 'xlink:href', 'FSCommand', and 'seekSegmentTime'. `$comment\_body = $this->app->format->clean\_xss($comment\_body, true, $evil, 'removeEvilAttributes');` now utilizes this array for removal.

This commit attempts to fix the vulnerability by removing redundant cleaning operations and strengthening XSS sanitization by using a more robust list of patterns to remove potentially harmful attributes.
