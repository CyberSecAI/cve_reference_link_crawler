Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `coreServiceShell` component of Trend Micro Maximum Security, specifically how it handles symbolic links. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can trick the service into deleting arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Link Following/Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The core issue lies in the service's improper handling of symbolic links, leading to unintended file deletion.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to delete files via the service, allows a low privileged user to manipulate privileged system files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete any file, including critical Trend Micro files.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the file system, an attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ultimate impact is the potential execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links on the system.
- **Abuse of coreServiceShell:** The exploit involves manipulating the service using the created symbolic links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to create symbolic links, which generally requires some degree of file system access, even as a low privileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro Maximum Security version 17.7 for Windows.
- Trend Micro has released an update (version 17.7 or higher) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nicholas Zubrisky and Michael DePlante of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSSv3 score is 7.8, indicating high severity, with vectors AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
