Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-4100

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the WP Cerber Security plugin's improper method of retrieving and validating a visitor's IP address. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IP Protection Bypass:** The plugin relies on checking the `X-Forwarded-For` header to determine the client's IP address when a proxy is in use. An attacker can manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header to spoof their IP address and bypass IP-based access restrictions.
- The plugin prioritizes the value of the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header over the actual remote address of the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker whose IP address has been blocked by the plugin can bypass these blocks by injecting a different IP address into the `X-Forwarded-For` header, gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests. An attacker includes the `X-Forwarded-For` header in their request.
- This bypasses the IP address checks in the vulnerable versions of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress website protected by the WP Cerber Security plugin.
- The attacker does not need any specific user privileges on the target website.
- The attacker's IP address must be blocked for the bypass to have an impact.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in WP Cerber Security plugin versions up to and including 9.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.5 by correctly sanitizing and prioritizing the IP addresses from the headers.
