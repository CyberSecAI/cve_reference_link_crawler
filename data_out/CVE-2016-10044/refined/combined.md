ALSA: hda - Add the top speaker pin config for HP Spectre x360
commit 0eec880966e77bdbee0112989a2be67d92e39929 upstream.
HP Spectre x360 with CX20724 codec has two speaker outputs while the
BIOS sets up only the bottom one (NID 0x17) and disables the top one
(NID 0x1d).
This patch adds a fixup simply defining the proper pincfg for NID 0x1d
so that the top speaker works as is.

Revert "usbtmc: convert to devm\_kzalloc"
commit ab21b63e8aedfc73565dd9cdd51eb338341177cb upstream.
This reverts commit e6c7efdcb76f11b04e3d3f71c8d764ab75c9423b.
Turns out it was totally wrong. The memory is supposed to be bound to
the kref, as the original code was doing correctly, not the
device/driver binding as the devm\_kzalloc() would cause.
This fixes an oops when read would be called after the device was
unbound from the driver.

usb: usbip: vudc: fix left shift overflow
commit 238b7bd91b16d5a08326f858db42229b212e53d8 upstream.
In v\_recv\_cmd\_submit(), urb\_p->urb->pipe has the type unsigned int
(which is 32-bit long on x86\_64) but 11<<30 results in a 34-bit integer.
Therefore the 2 leading bits are truncated and
urb\_p->urb->pipe &= ~(11 << 30);
has the same meaning as
urb\_p->urb->pipe &= ~(3 << 30);
This second statement seems to be how the code was intended to be
written, as PIPE\_ constants have values between 0 and 3.
The overflow has been detected with a clang warning:
drivers/usb/usbip/vudc\_rx.c:145:27: warning: signed shift result
(0x2C0000000) requires 35 bits to represent, but 'int' only has 32

usb: misc: legousbtower: Fix NULL pointer deference
commit 2fae9e5a7babada041e2e161699ade2447a01989 upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference caused by a race codition in
the probe function of the legousbtower driver. It re-structures the
probe function to only register the interface after successfully reading
the board's firmware ID.
The probe function does not deregister the usb interface after an error
receiving the devices firmware ID. The device file registered
(/dev/usb/legousbtower%d) may be read/written globally before the probe
function returns. When tower\_delete is called in the probe function
(after an r/w has been initiated), core dev structures are deleted while
the file operation functions are still running. If the 0 address is
mappable on the machine, this vulnerability can be used to create a
Local Priviege Escalation exploit via a write-what-where condition by
remapping dev->interrupt\_out\_buffer in tower\_write. A forged USB device
and local program execution would be required for LPE. The USB device
would have to delay the control message in tower\_probe and accept
the control urb in tower\_open whilst guest code initiated a write to the
device file as tower\_delete is called from the error in tower\_probe.
This bug has existed since 2003. Patch tested by emulated device.

dm log writes: fix bug with too large bios
commit 7efb367320f56fc4d549875b6f3a6940018ef2e5 upstream.
bio\_alloc() can allocate a bio with at most BIO\_MAX\_PAGES (256) vector
entries. However, the incoming bio may have more vector entries if it
was allocated by other means. For example, bcache submits bios with
more than BIO\_MAX\_PAGES entries. This results in bio\_alloc() failure.
To avoid the failure, change the code so that it allocates bio with at
most BIO\_MAX\_PAGES entries. If the incoming bio has more entries,
bio\_add\_page() will fail and a new bio will be allocated - the code that
handles bio\_add\_page() failure already exists in the dm-log-writes
target.

aio: mark AIO pseudo-fs noexec
commit 22f6b4d34fcf039c63a94e7670e0da24f8575a5a upstream.
This ensures that do\_mmap() won't implicitly make AIO memory mappings
executable if the READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC personality flag is set. Such
behavior is problematic because the security\_mmap\_file LSM hook doesn't
catch this case, potentially permitting an attacker to bypass a W^X
policy enforced by SELinux.
I have tested the patch on my machine.
To test the behavior, compile and run this:
#define \_GNU\_SOURCE
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(void) {
personality(READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC);
aio\_context\_t ctx = 0;
if (syscall(\_\_NR\_io\_setup, 1, &ctx))
err(1, "io\_setup");
char cmd[1000];
sprintf(cmd, "cat /proc/%d/maps | grep -F '/[aio]'",
(int)getpid());
system(cmd);
return 0;
}
In the output, "rw-s" is good, "rwxs" is bad.

tpm\_crb: fix mapping of the buffers
commit 422eac3f7deae34dbaffd08e03e27f37a5394a56 upstream.
On my Lenovo x250 the following situation occurs:
[18697.813871] tpm\_crb MSFT0101:00: can't request region for resource
[mem 0xacdff080-0xacdfffff]
The mapping of the control area overlaps the mapping of the command
buffer. The control area is mapped over page, which is not right. It
should mapped over sizeof(struct crb\_control\_area).
Fixing this issue unmasks another issue. Command and response buffers
can overlap and they do interleave on this machine. According to the PTP
specification the overlapping means that they are mapped to the same
buffer.
The commit has been also on a Haswell NUC where things worked before
applying this fix so that the both code paths for response buffer
initialization are tested.

IB/mlx4: Use correct subnet-prefix in QP1 mads under SR-IOV
commit 8ec07bf8a8b57d6c58927a16a0a22c0115cf2855 upstream.
When sending QP1 MAD packets which use a GRH, the source GID
(which consists of the 64-bit subnet prefix, and the 64 bit port GUID)
must be included in the packet GRH.
For SR-IOV, a GID cache is used, since the source GID needs to be the
slave's source GID, and not the Hypervisor's GID. This cache also
included a subnet\_prefix. Unfortunately, the subnet\_prefix field in
the cache was never initialized (to the default subnet prefix 0xfe80::0).
As a result, this field remained all zeroes. Therefore, when SR-IOV
was active, all QP1 packets which included a GRH had a source GID
subnet prefix of all-zeroes.
However, the subnet-prefix should initially be 0xfe80::0 (the default
subnet prefix). In addition, if OpenSM modifies a port's subnet prefix,
the new subnet prefix must be used in the GRH when sending QP1 packets.
To fix this we now initialize the subnet prefix in the SR-IOV GID cache
to the default subnet prefix. We update the cached value if/when OpenSM
modifies the port's subnet prefix. We take this cached value when sending
QP1 packets when SR-IOV is active.
Note that the value is stored as an atomic64. This eliminates any need
for locking when the subnet prefix is being updated.
Note also that we depend on the FW generating the "port management change"
event for tracking subnet-prefix changes performed by OpenSM. If running
early FW (before 2.9.4630), subnet prefix changes will not be tracked (but
the default subnet prefix still will be stored in the cache; therefore
users who do not modify the subnet prefix will not have a problem).
IF there is a need for such tracking also for early FW, we will add that
capability in a subsequent patch.

IB/mlx4: Fix incorrect MC join state bit-masking on SR-IOV
commit e5ac40cd66c2f3cd11bc5edc658f012661b16347 upstream.
Because of an incorrect bit-masking done on the join state bits, when
handling a join request we failed to detect a difference between the
group join state and the request join state when joining as send only
full member (0x8). This caused the MC join request not to be sent.
This issue is relevant only when SRIOV is enabled and SM supports
send only full member.
This fix separates scope bits and join states bits a nibble each.

IB/ipoib: Don't allow MC joins during light MC flush
commit 344bacca8cd811809fc33a249f2738ab757d327f upstream.
This fix solves a race between light flush and on the fly joins.
Light flush doesn't set the device to down and unset IPOIB\_OPER\_UP
flag, this means that if while flushing we have a MC join in progress
and the QP was attached to BC MGID we can have a mismatches when
re-attaching a QP to the BC MGID.
The light flush would set the broadcast group to NULL causing an on
the fly join to rejoin and reattach to the BC MCG as well as adding
the BC MGID to the multicast list. The flush process would later on
remove the BC MGID and detach it from the QP. On the next flush
the BC MGID is present in the multicast list but not found when trying
to detach it because of the previous double attach and single detach.

regmap: rbtree: Avoid overlapping nodes
commit 1bc8da4e143c0fd8807e061a66d91d5972601ab1 upstream.
When searching for a suitable node that should be used for inserting a new
register, which does not fall within the range of any existing node, we not
only looks for nodes which are directly adjacent to the new register, but
for nodes within a certain proximity. This is done to avoid creating lots
of small nodes with just a few registers spacing in between, which would
increase memory usage as well as tree traversal time.
This means there might be multiple node candidates which fall within the
proximity range of the new register. If we choose the first node we
encounter, under certain register insertion patterns it is possible to end
up with overlapping ranges. This will break order in the rbtree and can
cause the cached register value to become corrupted.
E.g. take the simplified example where the proximity range is 2 and the
register insertion sequence is 1, 4, 2, 3, 5.
\* Insert of register 1 creates a new node, this is the root of the rbtree
\* Insert of register 4 creates a new node, which is inserted to the right
of the root.
\* Insert of register 2 gets inserted to the first node
\* Insert of register 3 gets inserted to the first node
\* Insert of register 5 also gets inserted into the first node since
this is the first node encountered and it is within the proximity range.
Now there are two overlapping nodes.
To avoid this always choose the node that is closest to the new register.
This will ensure that nodes will not overlap. The tree traversal is still
done as a binary search, we just don't stop at the first node found. So the
complexity of the algorithm stays within the same order.
Ideally if a new register is in the range of two adjacent blocks those
blocks should be merged, but that is a much more invasive change and left
for later.
The issue was initially introduced in commit 472fdec7380c ("regmap: rbtree:
Reduce number of nodes, take 2"), but became much more exposed by commit
6399aea629b0 ("regmap: rbtree: When adding a reg do a bsearch for target
node") which changed the order in which nodes are looked-up.

IB/ipoib: Fix memory corruption in ipoib cm mode connect flow
commit 546481c2816ea3c061ee9d5658eb48070f69212e upstream.
When a new CM connection is being requested, ipoib driver copies data
from the path pointer in the CM/tx object, the path object might be
invalid at the point and memory corruption will happened later when now
the CM driver will try using that data.
The next scenario demonstrates it:
neigh\_add\_path --> ipoib\_cm\_create\_tx -->
queue\_work (pointer to path is in the cm/tx struct)
#while the work is still in the queue,
#the port goes down and causes the ipoib\_flush\_paths:
ipoib\_flush\_paths --> path\_free --> kfree(path)
#at this point the work scheduled starts.
ipoib\_cm\_tx\_start --> copy from the (invalid)path pointer:
(memcpy(&pathrec, &p->path->pathrec, sizeof pathrec);)
-> memory corruption.
To fix that the driver now starts the CM/tx connection only if that
specific path exists in the general paths database.
This check is protected with the relevant locks, and uses the gid from
the neigh member in the CM/tx object which is valid according to the ref
count that was taken by the CM/tx.

This will incorrectly apply modifications intended for vmcs01 to vmcs02

kernel/fork: fix CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID regression in nscd
commit 735f2770a770156100f534646158cb58cb8b2939 upstream.
Commit fec1d0115240 ("[PATCH] Disable CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID for abnormal
exit") has caused a subtle regression in nscd which uses
CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID to clear the nscd\_certainly\_running flag in the
shared databases, so that the clients are notified when nscd is
restarted. Now, when nscd uses a non-persistent database, clients that
have it mapped keep thinking the database is being updated by nscd, when
in fact nscd has created a new (anonymous) one (for non-persistent
databases it uses an unlinked file as backend).
The original proposal for the CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID change claimed
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/25/233):
: The NPTL library uses the CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID flag on clone() syscalls
: on behalf of pthread\_create() library calls. This feature is used to
: request that the kernel clear the thread-id in user space (at an address
: provided in the syscall) when the thread disassociates itself from the
: address space, which is done in mm\_release().
:
: Unfortunately, when a multi-threaded process incurs a core dump (such as
: from a SIGSEGV), the core-dumping thread sends SIGKILL signals to all of
: the other threads, which then proceed to clear their user-space tids
: before synchronizing in exit\_mm() with the start of core dumping. This
: misrepresents the state of process's address space at the time of the
: SIGSEGV and makes it more difficult for someone to debug NPTL and glibc
: problems (misleading him/her to conclude that the threads had gone away
: before the fault).
:
: The fix below is to simply avoid the CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID action if a
: core dump has been initiated.
The resulting patch from Roland (https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/269)
seems to have a larger scope than the original patch asked for. It
seems that limitting the scope of the check to core dumping should work
for SIGSEGV issue describe above.

sysctl: handle error writing UINT\_MAX to u32 fields
commit e7d316a02f683864a12389f8808570e37fb90aa3 upstream.
We have scripts which write to certain fields on 3.18 kernels but this
seems to be failing on 4.4 kernels. An entry which we write to here is
xfrm\_aevent\_rseqth which is u32.
echo 4294967295 > /proc/sys/net/core/xfrm\_aevent\_rseqth
Commit 230633d109e3 ("kernel/sysctl.c: detect overflows when converting
to int") prevented writing to sysctl entries when integer overflow
occurs. However, this does not apply to unsigned integers.
Heinrich suggested that we introduce a new option to handle 64 bit
limits and set min as 0 and max as UINT\_MAX. This might not work as it
leads to issues similar to \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax. Alternatively,
we would need to change the datatype of the entry to 64 bit.
static int \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax(void \*data, struct ctl\_table
{
i = (unsigned long \*) data; //This cast is causing to read beyond the size of data (u32)
vleft = table->maxlen / sizeof(unsigned long); //vleft is 0 because maxlen is sizeof(u32) which is lesser than sizeof(unsigned long) on x86\_64.
Introduce a new proc handler proc\_douintvec. Individual proc entries
will need to be updated to use the new handler.

powerpc/prom: Fix sub-processor option passed to ibm, client-architecture-support
commit 66443efa83dc73775100b7442962ce2cb0d4472e upstream.
When booting from an OpenFirmware which supports it, we use the
"ibm,client-architecture-support" firmware call to communicate
our capabilities to firmware.
The format of the structure we pass to firmware is specified in
PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Requirements), or the public version
LoPAPR (Linux on Power Architecture Platform Reference).
Referring to table 244 in LoPAPR v1.1, option vector 5 contains a 4 byte
field at bytes 17-20 for the "Platform Facilities Enable". This is
followed by a 1 byte field at byte 21 for "Sub-Processor Represenation
Level".
Comparing to the code, there we have the Platform Facilities
options (OV5\_PFO\_\*) at byte 17, but we fail to pad that field out to its
full width of 4 bytes. This means the OV5\_SUB\_PROCESSORS option is
incorrectly placed at byte 18.
Fix it by adding zero bytes for bytes 18, 19, 20, and comment the bytes
to hopefully make it clearer in future.
As far as I'm aware nothing actually consumes this value at this time,
so the effect of this bug is nil in practice.
It does mean we've been incorrectly setting bit 15 of the "Platform
Facilities Enable" option for the past ~3 1/2 years, so we should avoid
allocating that bit to anything else in future.

In case dma\_mapping\_error() returns an error in dma\_rxfill, we would be
leaking a packet that we allocated with brcmu\_pkt\_buf\_get\_skb().

xprtrdma: Remove FMRs from the unmap list after unmapping
commit 38f1932e60ba249660bbae585f61ef2dee3313a4 upstream.
ib\_unmap\_fmr() takes a list of FMRs to unmap. However, it does not
remove the FMRs from this list as it processes them. Other
ib\_unmap\_fmr() call sites are careful to remove FMRs from the list
after ib\_unmap\_fmr() returns.
Since commit 7c7a5390dc6c8 ("xprtrdma: Add ro\_unmap\_sync method for FMR")
fmr\_op\_unmap\_sync passes more than one FMR to ib\_unmap\_fmr(), but
it didn't bother to remove the FMRs from that list once the call was
complete.
I've noticed some instability that could be related to list
tangling by the new fmr\_op\_unmap\_sync() logic. In an abundance
of caution, add some defensive logic to clean up properly after
ib\_unmap\_fmr().

watchdog: core: Clear WDOG\_HW\_RUNNING before calling the stop function
commit 3c10bbde10fe4dca52726e246cefa6b0a1dfbd3e upstream.
WDOG\_HW\_RUNNING indicates that the hardware watchdog is running while the
watchdog device is closed. The flag may be set by the driver when it is
instantiated to indicate that the watchdog is running, and that the
watchdog core needs to send heartbeat requests to the driver until the
watchdog device is opened.
When the watchdog device is closed, the flag can be used by the driver's
stop function to indicate to the watchdog core that it was unable to stop
the watchdog, and that the watchdog core needs to send heartbeat requests.
This only works if the flag is actually cleared when the watchdog is
stopped. To avoid having to clear the flag in each driver's stop function,
clear it in the watchdog core before calling the stop function.

v4l: vsp1: Fix crash when resetting pipeline
commit d69e40fade97b6b19837c1772efa516bc28cc870 upstream.
The vsp1\_pipeline\_reset() function loops over pipeline inputs and output
and resets them. When doing so it assumes both that the pipeline has
been correctly configured with an output, and that inputs are are stored
in the pipe inputs array at positions 0 to num\_inputs-1.
Both the assumptions are incorrect. The pipeline might need to be reset
after a failed attempts to configure it, without any output specified.
Furthermore, inputs are stored in a positiong equal to their RPF index,
possibly creating holes in the inputs array if the RPFs are not used in
sequence.
Fix both issues by looping over the whole inputs array and skipping
unused entries, and ignoring the output when not set.

is opened, the filesystem can't be unmounted. Hence the pstore module
can't be unloaded either.
So I drop the opened reference count in this patch.

blk-mq: actually hook up defer list when running requests
commit 52b9c330c6a8a4b5a1819bdaddf4ec76ab571e81 upstream.
If ->queue\_rq() returns BLK\_MQ\_RQ\_QUEUE\_OK, we use continue and skip
over the rest of the loop body. However, dptr is assigned later in the
loop body, and the BLK\_MQ\_RQ\_QUEUE\_OK case is exactly the case that we'd
want it for.
NVMe isn't actually using BLK\_MQ\_F\_DEFER\_ISSUE yet, nor is any other
in-tree driver, but if the code's going to be there, it might as well
work.

hwrng: omap - Fix assumption that runtime\_get\_sync will always succeed
commit 61dc0a446e5d08f2de8a24b45f69a1e302bb1b1b upstream.
pm\_runtime\_get\_sync does return a error value that must be checked for
error conditions, else, due to various reasons, the device maynot be
enabled and the system will crash due to lack of clock to the hardware
module.

ARM: sa1111: fix pcmcia suspend/resume
commit 06dfe5cc0cc684e735cb0232fdb756d30780b05d upstream.
SA1111 PCMCIA was broken when PCMCIA switched to using dev\_pm\_ops for
the PCMCIA socket class. PCMCIA used to handle suspend/resume via the
socket hosting device, which happened at normal device suspend/resume
time.
However, the referenced commit changed this: much of the resume now
happens much earlier, in the noirq resume handler of dev\_pm\_ops.
However, on SA1111, the PCMCIA device is not accessible as the SA1111
has not been resumed at \_noirq time. It's slightly worse than that,
because the SA1111 has already been put to sleep at \_noirq time, so
suspend doesn't work properly.
Fix this by converting the core SA1111 code to use dev\_pm\_ops as well,
and performing its own suspend/resume at noirq time.
This fixes these errors in the kernel log:
pcmcia\_socket pcmcia\_socket0: time out after reset
pcmcia\_socket pcmcia\_socket1: time out after reset
and the resulting lack of PCMCIA cards after a S2RAM cycle.

ARM: shmobile: fix regulator quirk for Gen2
commit c2f321126e31cd69365e65ecd4a7c774e4fc71d2 upstream.
The current implementation only works if the da9xxx devices are added
before their drivers are registered. Only then it can apply the fixes to
both devices. Otherwise, the driver for the first device gets probed
before the fix for the second device can be applied. This is what
fails when using the IP core switcher or when having the i2c master
driver as a module.
So, we need to disable both da9xxx once we detected one of them. We now
use i2c\_transfer with hardcoded i2c\_messages and device addresses, so we
don't need the da9xxx client devices to be instantiated. Because the
fixup is used on specific boards only, the addresses are not going to
change.

regulator: pwm: Fix regulator ramp delay for continuous mode
commit c2588393e6315ab68207323d37d2a73713d6bc81 upstream.
The original commit adding support for continuous voltage mode didn't
handle the regulator ramp delay properly. It treated the delay as a
fixed delay in uS despite the property being defined as uV / uS. Let's
adjust it. Luckily there appear to be no users of this ramp delay for
PWM regulators (as per grepping through device trees in linuxnext).
Note also that the upper bound of usleep\_range probably shouldn't be a
full 1 ms longer than the lower bound since I've seen plenty of hardware
with a ramp rate of ~5000 uS / uV and for small jumps the total delays
are in the tens of uS. 1000 is way too much. We'll try to be dynamic
and use 10%.
NOTE: This commit doesn't add support for regulator-enable-ramp-delay.
That could be done in a future patch when someone has a user of that
featre.
Though this patch is shows as "fixing" a bug, there are no actual known
users of continuous mode PWM regulator w/ ramp delay in mainline and so
this likely won't have any effect on anyone unless they are working
out-of-tree with private patches. For anyone in this state, it is
highly encouraged to also pick Boris Brezillon's WIP patches to get
yourself a reliable and glitch-free regulator.

Bluetooth: split sk\_filter in l2cap\_sock\_recv\_cb
commit dbb50887c8f619fc5c3489783ebc3122bc134a31 upstream.
During an audit for sk\_filter(), we found that rx\_busy\_skb handling
in l2cap\_sock\_recv\_cb() and l2cap\_sock\_recvmsg() looks not quite as
intended.
The assumption from commit e328140fdacb ("Bluetooth: Use event-driven
approach for handling ERTM receive buffer") is that errors returned
from sock\_queue\_rcv\_skb() are due to receive buffer shortage. However,
nothing should prevent doing a setsockopt() with SO\_ATTACH\_FILTER on
the socket, that could drop some of the incoming skbs when handled in
sock\_queue\_rcv\_skb().
In that case sock\_queue\_rcv\_skb() will return with -EPERM, propagated
from sk\_filter() and if in L2CAP\_MODE\_ERTM mode, wrong assumption was
that we failed due to receive buffer being full. From that point onwards,
due to the to-be-dropped skb being held in rx\_busy\_skb, we cannot make
any forward progress as rx\_busy\_skb is never cleared from l2cap\_sock\_recvmsg(),
due to the filter drop verdict over and over coming from sk\_filter().
Meanwhile, in l2cap\_sock\_recv\_cb() all new incoming skbs are being
dropped due to rx\_busy\_skb being occupied.
Instead, just use \_\_sock\_queue\_rcv\_skb() where an error really tells that
there's a receive buffer issue. Split the sk\_filter() and enable it for
non-segmented modes at queuing time since at this point in time the skb has
already been through the ERTM state machine and it has been acked, so dropping
is not allowed. Instead, for ERTM and streaming mode, call sk\_filter() in
l2cap\_data\_rcv() so the packet can be dropped before the state machine sees it.

Commit bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into separate
braille.[ch] files") moved the parsing of braille-related options into
\_braille\_console\_setup(), changing the type of variable str from char\*
to char\*\*. In this commit, memcmp(str, "brl,", 4) was correctly updated
to memcmp(\*str, "brl,", 4) but not memcmp(str, "brl=", 4).
Update the code to make "brl=" option work again and replace memcmp()
with strncmp() to make the compiler able to detect such an issue.
Fixes: bbeddf52adc1 ("printk: move braille console support into separate braille.[ch] files")

arch\_uprobe\_pre\_xol needs to emulate a branch if a branch instruction

MIPS: Malta: Fix IOCU disable switch read for MIPS64
commit 305723ab439e14debc1d339aa04e835d488b8253 upstream.
Malta boards used with CPU emulators feature a switch to disable use of
an IOCU. Software has to check this switch & ignore any present IOCU if
the switch is closed. The read used to do this was unsafe for 64 bit
kernels, as it simply casted the address 0xbf403000 to a pointer &
dereferenced it. Whilst in a 32 bit kernel this would access kseg1, in a
64 bit kernel this attempts to access xuseg & results in an address
error exception.
Fix by accessing a correctly formed ckseg1 address generated using the
CKSEG1ADDR macro.
Whilst modifying this code, define the name of the register and the bit
we care about within it, which indicates whether PCI DMA is routed to
the IOCU or straight to DRAM. The code previously checked that bit 0 was
also set, but the least significant 7 bits of the CONFIG\_GEN0 register
contain the value of the MReqInfo signal provided to the IOCU OCP bus,
so singling out bit 0 makes little sense & that part of the check is
dropped.

MIPS: uprobes: remove incorrect set\_orig\_insn
commit ddabfa5c2e33f1b495f3e0176de7057850915c0b upstream.
Generic kernel code implements a weak version of set\_orig\_insn that
moves cached 'insn' from arch\_uprobe to the original code location when
the trap is removed.
MIPS variant used arch\_uprobe->orig\_inst which was never initialised
properly, so this code only inserted a nop instead of the original
instruction. With that change orig\_inst can also be safely removed.

arm64: debug: avoid resetting stepping state machine when TIF\_SINGLESTEP
commit 3a402a709500c5a3faca2111668c33d96555e35a upstream.
When TIF\_SINGLESTEP is set for a task, the single-step state machine is
enabled and we must take care not to reset it to the active-not-pending
state if it is already in the active-pending state.
Unfortunately, that's exactly what user\_enable\_single\_step does, by
unconditionally setting the SS bit in the SPSR for the current task.
This causes failures in the GDB testsuite, where GDB ends up missing
expected step traps if the instruction being stepped generates another
trap, e.g. PTRACE\_EVENT\_FORK from an SVC instruction.
This patch fixes the problem by preserving the current state of the
stepping state machine when TIF\_SINGLESTEP is set on the current thread.

ARM: 8618/1: decompressor: reset ttbcr fields to use TTBR0 on ARMv7
commit 117e5e9c4cfcb7628f08de074fbfefec1bb678b7 upstream.
If the bootloader uses the long descriptor format and jumps to
kernel decompressor code, TTBCR may not be in a right state.
Before enabling the MMU, it is required to clear the TTBCR.PD0
field to use TTBR0 for translation table walks.
The commit dbece45894d3a ("ARM: 7501/1: decompressor:
reset ttbcr for VMSA ARMv7 cores") does the reset of TTBCR.N, but
doesn't consider all the bits for the size of TTBCR.N.
Clear TTBCR.PD0 field and reset all the three bits of TTBCR.N to
indicate the use of TTBR0 and the correct base address width.

irqchip/gicv3: Silence noisy DEBUG\_PER\_CPU\_MAPS warning
commit 727653d6ce7103b245eb8041f55dd5885f4c3289 upstream.
gic\_raise\_softirq() walks the list of cpus using for\_each\_cpu(), it calls
gic\_compute\_target\_list() which advances the iterator by the number of
CPUs in the cluster.
If gic\_compute\_target\_list() reaches the last CPU it leaves the iterator
pointing at the last CPU. This means the next time round the for\_each\_cpu()
loop cpumask\_next() will be called with an invalid CPU.
This triggers a warning when built with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_PER\_CPU\_MAPS:

gcc is apparently unablel to track the state of the local 'resp\_v2'
variable across the kzalloc() function, and warns about the response
variable being used without an initialization:
drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/nvm.c: In function ‘iwl\_mvm\_update\_mcc’:
drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/nvm.c:727:36: warning: ‘mcc\_resp\_v1’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
resp\_cp->n\_channels = mcc\_resp\_v1->n\_channels;
drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/nvm.c:721:3: warning: ‘mcc\_resp’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
memcpy(resp\_cp, mcc\_resp, resp\_len);
The warning showed up in x86 allmodconfig after my patch to
unhide -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings by default was merged,
though it always existed in randconfig builds. I did not
catch the warning earlier because I was testing on ARM, which
never produced the warning.
This rearranges the code in a way that improves readability for
both humans and the compiler, and that avoids the warning.

iwlwifi: pcie: fix access to scratch buffer
commit d5d0689aefc59c6a5352ca25d7e6d47d03f543ce upstream.
This fixes a pretty ancient bug that hasn't manifested itself
until now.
The scratchbuf for command queue is allocated only for 32 slots
but is accessed with the queue write pointer - which can be
up to 256.
Since the scratch buf size was 16 and there are up to 256 TFDs
we never passed a page boundary when accessing the scratch buffer,
but when attempting to increase the size of the scratch buffer a
panic was quick to follow when trying to access the address resulted
in a page boundary.

iwlwifi: mvm: fix txq aggregation bug
commit 2c4a247e42526d9aae8f5ce1f190b893532f2806 upstream.
Fix an issue where nullfunc frames and block ack requests
had the same tid as aggregation frames and were queued on
a non aggregation queue. The pending frames counter included
those frames but the check whether to decrement the pending
frames counter relied on the tid status and not on the txq id.
The result was an inconsistent state of the pending frames
counter followed by a failure to remove the station.
This failure triggered SYSASSERT 0x3421.
In addition, fix a situation in DQA mode where the number
of pending frames turned negative. This was due to the TX queue
being on the IWL\_EMPTYING\_HW\_QUEUE\_DELBA state and its frames
were still decremented.
Even though the SYSASSERT issue is fixed when DQA is disabled,
the issue is not completely solved when DQA is enabled and
should still be fixed.

sched/cputime: Fix prev steal time accouting during CPU hotplug
commit 3d89e5478bf550a50c99e93adf659369798263b0 upstream.
Commit:
e9532e69b8d1 ("sched/cputime: Fix steal time accounting vs. CPU hotplug")
... set rq->prev\_\* to 0 after a CPU hotplug comes back, in order to
fix the case where (after CPU hotplug) steal time is smaller than
rq->prev\_steal\_time.
However, this should never happen. Steal time was only smaller because of the
KVM-specific bug fixed by the previous patch. Worse, the previous patch
triggers a bug on CPU hot-unplug/plug operation: because
rq->prev\_steal\_time is cleared, all of the CPU's past steal time will be
accounted again on hot-plug.
Since the root cause has been fixed, we can just revert commit e9532e69b8d1.

mmc: tegra: Only advertise UHS modes if IO regulator is present
commit 4f6aa3264af4d44caaa649dd3ff1fe98f5817251 upstream.
To support UHS modes for Tegra an external regulator must be present
to adjust the IO voltage accordingly. Even if the regulator is not
present but the host supports the UHS modes and the device supports the
UHS modes, then we will attempt to switch to a high-speed mode. Without
an external regulator, Tegra will fail to switch to the high-speed
mode.
It has been found that with some SD cards, that once it has been switch
to operate at a high-speed mode, all subsequent commands issues to the
card will fail and so it will not be possible to switch back to a non
high-speed mode and so the SD card initialisation will fail.
The SDHCI core does not require that the host have an external regulator
when switching to UHS modes and therefore, the Tegra SDHCI host
controller should only advertise the UHS modes as being supported if the
regulator for the IO voltage is present. Fortunately, Tegra has a vendor
specific register which can be used to control which modes are
advertised via the SDHCI\_CAPABILITIES register. Hence, if there is no IO
voltage regulator available for the Tegra SDHCI host, then don't
advertise the UHS modes.
Note that if the regulator is not available, we also don't advertise that
the SDHCI is compatible with v3.0 of the SDHCI specification because
this will read the SDHCI\_CAPABILITIES\_1 register which will enable other
UHS modes.
This fixes commit 7ad2ed1dfcbe ("mmc: tegra: enable UHS-I modes") which
enables UHS mode without checking if the board can support them.

perf/core: Use this\_cpu\_ptr() when stopping AUX events
commit 8b6a3fe8fab97716990a3abde1a01fb5a34552a3 upstream.
When tearing down an AUX buf for an event via perf\_mmap\_close(),
\_\_perf\_event\_output\_stop() is called on the event's CPU to ensure that
trace generation is halted before the process of unmapping and
freeing the buffer pages begins.
The callback is performed via cpu\_function\_call(), which ensures that it
runs with interrupts disabled and is therefore not preemptible.
Unfortunately, the current code grabs the per-cpu context pointer using
get\_cpu\_ptr(), which unnecessarily disables preemption and doesn't pair
the call with put\_cpu\_ptr(), leading to a preempt\_count() imbalance and
a BUG when freeing the AUX buffer later on:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2249 at kernel/events/ring\_buffer.c:539 \_\_rb\_free\_aux+0x10c/0x120

rcuperf: Don't treat gp\_exp mis-setting as a WARN
commit af06d4f74a7d2132c805339bfd5ab771b5706f42 upstream.
0day found a boot warning triggered in rcu\_perf\_writer() on !SMP kernel:
WARN\_ON(rcu\_gp\_is\_normal() && gp\_exp);
, the root cause of which is trying to measure expedited grace
periods(by setting gp\_exp to true by default) when all the grace periods
are normal(TINY RCU only has normal grace periods).
However, such a mis-setting would only result in failing to measure the
performance for a specific kind of grace periods, therefore using a
WARN\_ON to check this is a little overkilling. We could handle this
inside rcuperf module via some error messages to tell users about the
mis-settings.
Therefore this patch removes the WARN\_ON in rcu\_perf\_writer() and
handles those checkings in rcu\_perf\_init() with plain if() code.
Moreover, this patch changes the default value of gp\_exp to 1) align
with rcutorture tests and 2) make the default setting work for all RCU
implementations by default.

ARM: 8617/1: dma: fix dma\_max\_pfn()
commit d248220f0465b818887baa9829e691fe662b2c5e upstream.
Since commit 6ce0d2001692 ("ARM: dma: Use dma\_pfn\_offset for dma address translation"),
dma\_to\_pfn() already returns the PFN with the physical memory start offset
so we don't need to add it again.
This fixes USB mass storage lock-up problem on systems that can't do DMA
over the entire physical memory range (e.g.) Keystone 2 systems with 4GB RAM
can only do DMA over the first 2GB. [K2E-EVM].
What happens there is that without this patch SCSI layer sets a wrong
bounce buffer limit in scsi\_calculate\_bounce\_limit() for the USB mass
storage device. dma\_max\_pfn() evaluates to 0x8fffff and bounce\_limit
is set to 0x8fffff000 whereas maximum DMA'ble physical memory on Keystone 2
is 0x87fffffff. This results in non DMA'ble pages being given to the
USB controller and hence the lock-up.
NOTE: in the above case, USB-SCSI-device's dma\_pfn\_offset was showing as 0.
This should have really been 0x780000 as on K2e, LOWMEM\_START is 0x80000000
and HIGHMEM\_START is 0x800000000. DMA zone is 2GB so dma\_max\_pfn should be
0x87ffff. The incorrect dma\_pfn\_offset for the USB storage device is because
USB devices are not correctly inheriting the dma\_pfn\_offset from the
USB host controller. This will be fixed by a separate patch.

ARM: 8616/1: dt: Respect property size when parsing CPUs
commit ba6dea4f7cedb4b1c17e36f4087675d817c2e24b upstream.
Whilst MPIDR values themselves are less than 32 bits, it is still
perfectly valid for a DT to have #address-cells > 1 in the CPUs node,
resulting in the "reg" property having leading zero cell(s). In that
situation, the big-endian nature of the data conspires with the current
behaviour of only reading the first cell to cause the kernel to think
all CPUs have ID 0, and become resoundingly unhappy as a consequence.
Take the full property length into account when parsing CPUs so as to
be correct under any circumstances.

drm/udl: fix line iterator in damage handling
commit 90fd68dcf9a763f7e575c8467415bd8a66d073f4 upstream.
The udl damage handler is supposed to render 'height' lines, but its
iterator has an obvious typo that makes it miss most lines if the
rectangle does not cover 0/0.
Fix the damage handler to correctly render all lines.
This is a fallout from:

can: dev: fix deadlock reported after bus-off
commit 9abefcb1aaa58b9d5aa40a8bb12c87d02415e4c8 upstream.
A timer was used to restart after the bus-off state, leading to a
relatively large can\_restart() executed in an interrupt context,
which in turn sets up pinctrl. When this happens during system boot,
there is a high probability of grabbing the pinctrl\_list\_mutex,
which is locked already by the probe() of other device, making the
kernel suspect a deadlock condition [1].
To resolve this issue, the restart\_timer is replaced by a delayed
work.

mm,ksm: fix endless looping in allocating memory when ksm enable
commit 5b398e416e880159fe55eefd93c6588fa072cd66 upstream.
I hit the following hung task when runing a OOM LTP test case with 4.1
kernel.
Call trace:
[] \_\_switch\_to+0x74/0x8c
[] \_\_schedule+0x23c/0x7bc
[] schedule+0x3c/0x94
[] rwsem\_down\_write\_failed+0x214/0x350
[] down\_write+0x64/0x80
[] \_\_ksm\_exit+0x90/0x19c
[] mmput+0x118/0x11c

[] get\_signal+0x444/0x5e0
[] do\_signal+0x1d8/0x450
[] do\_notify\_resume+0x70/0x78
The oom victim cannot terminate because it needs to take mmap\_sem for
write while the lock is held by ksmd for read which loops in the page
allocator
ksm\_do\_scan
scan\_get\_next\_rmap\_item
down\_read
get\_next\_rmap\_item
alloc\_rmap\_item #ksmd will loop permanently.
There is no way forward because the oom victim cannot release any memory
in 4.1 based kernel. Since 4.6 we have the oom reaper which would solve
this problem because it would release the memory asynchronously.
Nevertheless we can relax alloc\_rmap\_item requirements and use
\_\_GFP\_NORETRY because the allocation failure is acceptable as ksm\_do\_scan
would just retry later after the lock got dropped.
Such a patch would be also easy to backport to older stable kernels which
do not have oom\_reaper.
While we are at it add GFP\_NOWARN so the admin doesn't have to be alarmed
by the allocation failure.

mtd: nand: davinci: Reinitialize the HW ECC engine in 4bit hwctl
commit f6d7c1b5598b6407c3f1da795dd54acf99c1990c upstream.
This fixes subpage writes when using 4-bit HW ECC.
There has been numerous reports about ECC errors with devices using this
driver for a while. Also the 4-bit ECC has been reported as broken with
subpages in [1] and with 16 bits NANDs in the driver and in mach\* board
files both in mainline and in the vendor BSPs.
What I saw with 4-bit ECC on a 16bits NAND (on an LCDK) which got me to
try reinitializing the ECC engine:
- R/W on whole pages properly generates/checks RS code
- try writing the 1st subpage only of a blank page, the subpage is well
written and the RS code properly generated, re-reading the same page
the HW detects some ECC error, reading the same page again no ECC
error is detected
Note that the ECC engine is already reinitialized in the 1-bit case.
Tested on my LCDK with UBI+UBIFS using subpages.
This could potentially get rid of the issue workarounded in [1].

cgroup: fix invalid controller enable rejections with cgroup namespace
commit 9157056da8f8c4a6305f15619e269f164b63a6de upstream.
On the v2 hierarchy, "cgroup.subtree\_control" rejects controller
enables if the cgroup has processes in it. The enforcement of this
logic assumes that the cgroup wouldn't have any css\_sets associated
with it if there are no tasks in the cgroup, which is no longer true
since a79a908fd2b0 ("cgroup: introduce cgroup namespaces").
When a cgroup namespace is created, it pins the css\_set of the
creating task to use it as the root css\_set of the namespace. This
extra reference stays as long as the namespace is around and makes
"cgroup.subtree\_control" think that the namespace root cgroup is not
empty even when it is and thus reject controller enables.
Fix it by making cgroup\_subtree\_control() walk and test emptiness of
each css\_set instead of testing whether the list\_head is empty.
While at it, update the comment of cgroup\_task\_count() to indicate
that the returned value may be higher than the number of tasks, which
has always been true due to temporary references and doesn't break
anything.

cpuset: handle race between CPU hotplug and cpuset\_hotplug\_work
commit 28b89b9e6f7b6c8fef7b3af39828722bca20cfee upstream.
A discrepancy between cpu\_online\_mask and cpuset's effective\_cpus
mask is inevitable during hotplug since cpuset defers updating of
effective\_cpus mask using a workqueue, during which time nothing
prevents the system from more hotplug operations. For that reason
guarantee\_online\_cpus() walks up the cpuset hierarchy until it finds
an intersection under the assumption that top cpuset's effective\_cpus
mask intersects with cpu\_online\_mask even with such a race occurring.
However a sequence of CPU hotplugs can open a time window, during which
none of the effective CPUs in the top cpuset intersect with
cpu\_online\_mask.
For example when there are 4 possible CPUs 0-3 and only CPU0 is online:
======================== ===========================
cpu\_online\_mask top\_cpuset.effective\_cpus
======================== ===========================
echo 1 > cpu2/online.
CPU hotplug notifier woke up hotplug work but not yet scheduled.
[0,2] [0]
echo 0 > cpu0/online.
The workqueue is still runnable.
[2] [0]
======================== ===========================
Now there is no intersection between cpu\_online\_mask and
top\_cpuset.effective\_cpus. Thus invoking sys\_sched\_setaffinity() at
this moment can cause following:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000d0
------------[ cut here ]------------
Kernel BUG at ffffffc0001389b0 [verbose debug info unavailable]
Internal error: Oops - BUG: 96000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP

LR is at cpuset\_cpus\_allowed+0x4c/0x6c
Process taskset (pid: 1420, stack limit = 0xffffffc06e124020)
Call trace:
[] guarantee\_online\_cpus+0x2c/0x58

[] sched\_setaffinity+0xc0/0x1ac
[] SyS\_sched\_setaffinity+0x98/0xac
[] el0\_svc\_naked+0x24/0x28
The top cpuset's effective\_cpus are guaranteed to be identical to
cpu\_online\_mask eventually. Hence fall back to cpu\_online\_mask when
there is no intersection between top cpuset's effective\_cpus and
cpu\_online\_mask.

```
This ensures that do_mmap() won't implicitly make AIO memory mappings
executable if the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag is set.  Such
behavior is problematic because the security_mmap_file LSM hook doesn't
catch this case, potentially permitting an attacker to bypass a W^X
policy enforced by SELinux.

I have tested the patch on my machine.

To test the behavior, compile and run this:

    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/personality.h>
    #include <linux/aio_abi.h>
    #include <err.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <sys/syscall.h>

    int main(void) {
        personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC);
        aio_context_t ctx = 0;
        if (syscall(__NR_io_setup, 1, &ctx))
            err(1, "io_setup");

        char cmd[1000];
        sprintf(cmd, "cat /proc/%d/maps | grep -F '/[aio]'",
            (int)getpid());
        system(cmd);
        return 0;
    }

In the output, "rw-s" is good, "rwxs" is bad.

# Android Security Bulletin—February 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published February 06, 2017 | Updated February 8, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of February 05, 2017 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on January 03,
2017 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-02-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-02-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-02-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-02-01
    and 2017-02-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the February
  05, 2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-02-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-02-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-02-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-02-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2017-02-01]`
* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2017-02-05]`

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the February 1, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of February 5, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-02-01](#2017-02-01-details) and
[2017-02-05](#2017-02-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

aio: mark AIO pseudo-fs noexecThis ensures that do\_mmap() won't implicitly make AIO memory mappings
executable if the READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC personality flag is set. Such
behavior is problematic because the security\_mmap\_file LSM hook doesn't
catch this case, potentially permitting an attacker to bypass a W^X
policy enforced by SELinux.
I have tested the patch on my machine.
To test the behavior, compile and run this:
#define \_GNU\_SOURCE
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/personality.h>
#include <linux/aio\_abi.h>
#include <err.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
int main(void) {
personality(READ\_IMPLIES\_EXEC);
aio\_context\_t ctx = 0;
if (syscall(\_\_NR\_io\_setup, 1, &ctx))
err(1, "io\_setup");
char cmd[1000];
sprintf(cmd, "cat /proc/%d/maps | grep -F '/[aio]'",
(int)getpid());
system(cmd);
return 0;
}
In the output, "rw-s" is good, "rwxs" is bad.
