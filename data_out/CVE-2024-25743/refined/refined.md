Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-25743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation during the emulation of #VC (Virtualization Control) instructions within AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) environment on Linux guests.
*   A malicious hypervisor can inject a #VC exception into a CPU executing an SEV-SNP virtual machine (VM) at any time.
*   The SEV-SNP #VC exception handler in the VM does not verify if the #VC exception was legitimately caused by an instruction within the VM. It blindly trusts the hypervisor.
*   The #VC handler performs sensitive data operations between the VM and the hypervisor to emulate the instruction that caused the #VC, but these operations are vulnerable to malicious hypervisor injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authenticity Check:** The core weakness is the absence of a check to ensure the #VC exception originated from a legitimate instruction within the VM and not maliciously injected by the hypervisor.
*   **Trust of Hypervisor:** The SEV-SNP #VC handler incorrectly trusts the hypervisor, assuming the #VC is genuine.
*   **Vulnerable Emulation:** The emulation process of #VC instructions in the handler makes it vulnerable to manipulation. This handler is intended to be secure against Iago attacks, but is not designed to defend against malicious #VC injections by a hypervisor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious hypervisor can leak sensitive data from the VM to the hypervisor by tricking the handler into copying data from the VM.
*   **Integrity Breach:** A malicious hypervisor can inject arbitrary data into the VM by tricking the handler into writing attacker-controlled data to the VM.
*   **Disruption of SEV-SNP:** The malicious injection of #VC exceptions can lead to disruption of the SEV-SNP functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Hypervisor:** The attack vector is a malicious hypervisor that has control over the virtual machine's environment.
*   **Interrupt Injection:** The hypervisor injects external interrupts, specifically #VC exceptions, into the CPU executing the SEV-SNP VM.
*   **Exploiting #VC Handler:** The attacker leverages the handler's incorrect assumption that the #VC exception is legitimate and utilizes it to perform malicious operations. Specifically, the attacker injects interrupt 0x80 which is used by linux for legacy 32-bit syscalls and can arbitrarily change the value stored in the EAX register while a SEV VM is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Hypervisor Control:** The attacker must have control of the hypervisor and be able to inject interrupts into the target VM.
*   **SEV-SNP Environment:** The target VM must be using AMD SEV-SNP technology.
*   **Linux Guest OS:** The vulnerability is specific to Linux guests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is referred to as "WeSee".
*   AMD acknowledges that the vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel implementation of SEV-SNP.
*   Mitigations have been upstreamed to the Linux kernel to address some aspects of the vulnerability.
*   AMD has hardware security features to protect against this attack, but are not yet supported in Linux.
*   The vulnerability is relevant in scenarios where the hypervisor is untrusted, typically in confidential VM setups.
*   The SUSE bug report indicates that they are marking this issue as "WONTFIX" since they do not yet support the scenario where the hypervisor is not trusted on the host side.
