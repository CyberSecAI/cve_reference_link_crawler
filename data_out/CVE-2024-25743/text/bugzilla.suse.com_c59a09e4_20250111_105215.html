This is security relevant only in setups where HV is not trusted and as such this would be only problematic in Confidential VMs. This is not a scenario we do support on the host side yet.  Affected hypervisor setups used at CSPs do not offer the AMD SEV-SNP Restricted Injection feature required to fix this issue, nor is any fix available in the upstream Linux kernel. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1223307#c13)  Thomas Leroy   2024-07-09 10:17:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Joerg Roedel from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1223307#c11)) > This CVE is affecting scenarios when the hypervisor can attack its guests. > This is security relevant only in setups where HV is not trusted and as such > this would be only problematic in Confidential VMs. This is not a scenario > we do support on the host side yet. >  > Affected hypervisor setups used at CSPs do not offer the AMD SEV-SNP > Restricted Injection feature required to fix this issue, nor is any fix > available in the upstream Linux kernel.  Thanks for the explanations Jörg. This makes sense to me for WONTFIX. Closing ``` |  |
