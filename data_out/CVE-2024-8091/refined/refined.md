- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "Enhanced Search Box" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly changing the plugin's settings, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or other malicious activities depending on the specific settings that can be modified.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page that includes a form with the required parameters to modify the settings. When a logged-in administrator visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, leading to unintended changes in the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML file/page.
