| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2292897#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-06-18 14:00:49 UTC  ``` In the cockpit component pam-ssh-add uses a call to atoi() to convert the environment variable `SSH_AGENT_PID` to a integer. This assumes that this env variable has not been tampered with and it the env variable has been mangled this can lead to an overflow. The solution proposed is to replace it with a call to strtol() with error checking.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2292897#c1)  Martin Pitt    2024-06-18 15:29:08 UTC  ``` > if the env variable has been mangled this can lead to an overflow. The solution proposed is to replace it with a call to strtol() with error checking.  Note: This is *not at all* the problem/solution. This was an initial misunderstanding/misreporting. The subject describes it better. See #2290859 for details.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2292897#c2)  Martin Pitt    2024-07-03 09:00:16 UTC  ``` The embargo got lifted. @ahanwate can you please remove the "security" group from #2290859 ? I am unable to do this myself. The bug should become public now. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2292897#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-12 09:24:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:9325 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9325](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9325)   ``` |  |
