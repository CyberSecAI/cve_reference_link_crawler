Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-14781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists within the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) component of Java SE and Java SE Embedded. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from how JNDI handles input, potentially allowing for injection of malicious data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data accessible through JNDI.
- **Partial Denial of Service:** A successful exploit might also lead to a partial denial of service, potentially affecting the availability of affected Java applications or systems.
- **Unauthorized access to data:** The vulnerability may allow for unauthorized read, update, insert or delete access to data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying data to APIs in the JNDI component through various methods such as web services.
- In the case of client-side applications such as web start applets, the vulnerability may be exploited by running untrusted code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote access:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to a vulnerable system over the network.
- **No authentication needed:**  The vulnerability is described as exploitable without requiring user credentials.
- **User interaction**: While the base CVSS score suggests no user interaction is required, the advisory also mentions that it can be exploited through sandboxed java web start applications and sandboxed java applets that do require user interaction.

**Additional Notes**

- The provided information is consistent across multiple sources (Debian, OpenSUSE, Oracle, Gentoo, and NetApp), with each focusing on patching and mitigation, as well as confirming the listed CVEs are related to the issues they are addressing.
- Oracle's advisory provides the most details, noting that CVE-2020-14781 is a component of a larger Critical Patch Update.
- NetApp specifically notes the vulnerability is exploitable remotely. They also mention how this vulnerability affects multiple products that incorporate the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries.
- Some sources note the impact includes potential partial denial of service attacks alongside unauthorized data access.
