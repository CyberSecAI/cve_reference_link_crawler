Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28172

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path within the Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector software. This means that the software might be looking for resources (like libraries, executables) in locations that are not secure or that can be manipulated by a malicious user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path: The software does not properly control the locations it searches for necessary files. This allows an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files into the search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Escalation of Privilege: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system than they would normally have. This could allow them to perform actions they are not authorized for, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying system configurations, or installing malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (not necessarily a privileged one).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a legitimate user account on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file into a directory which is part of the uncontrolled search path of the vulnerable software.
- User interaction (UI) is required for exploitation in CVSS v4.0: User interaction is characterized as 'Active', meaning that the user must perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector software before version 2022.1
- Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit before version 2024.1.0

**Mitigation:**
- Users of the affected products are recommended to update to version 2022.1 or later for Intel® Trace Analyzer and Collector, and 2024.1.0 or later for Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit.
