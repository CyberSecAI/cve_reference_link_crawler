{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files using `File.createTempFile()` on Unix-like systems. This method creates files with default permissions that allow other local users to read the contents, leading to potential information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would require local access to the system where the application is running to exploit this vulnerability. They could also exploit this via supplying data to a web service.",
      "additional_information": "Netty's multipart decoders using `File.createTempFile()` on unix-like systems were found to create temporary files with insecure default permissions, allowing other local users to read the file contents if sensitive data is stored. The vulnerability also affects `SelfSignedCertificate` class, where it creates temporary files for the key and the certificate."
