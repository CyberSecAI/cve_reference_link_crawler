Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2019-2698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds access issue within the font layout engine of OpenJDK's 2D component, specifically related to the `setCurrGlyphID()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Access:** The core weakness is that the font layout engine attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer when handling font glyph IDs. This can lead to unexpected program behavior and potentially other vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sandbox Escape:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to escape the Java sandbox restrictions, potentially gaining control over the underlying system or gaining access to sensitive resources. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Font Handling:** The attack vector involves processing specifically crafted TrueType fonts that trigger the out-of-bounds access in the `setCurrGlyphID()` function.
*   **2D Component:** The vulnerability is located within the 2D graphics component of OpenJDK, making applications using this component vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Malicious Font Delivery:** An attacker needs the ability to deliver or have the vulnerable system process a crafted font file. This might involve tricking a user into opening a document with the malicious font, or serving the font over the network.
*   **Target Application Interaction:** The attacker needs to target an application using the vulnerable version of OpenJDK's 2D graphics component, such as a Java applet or application.

**Additional Information:**
*   Several sources mention that the vulnerability affects only OpenJDK 8 in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Other sources indicate that other versions are affected.
*   Patches are provided to address the vulnerability in various distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, openSUSE Leap, and Ubuntu, often alongside other security fixes.
