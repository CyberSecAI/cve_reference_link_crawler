The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3654.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Teixo by Teimas Global.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being included in the output of the web application. Specifically, the "seconds" parameter in the URL can be manipulated to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities. An attacker could potentially take over a registered user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the injected JavaScript payload in the "seconds" parameter and convinces a victim to visit it (e.g., via phishing).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need special privileges on the server and can be remote. The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting the page.
