Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `FerretCOT::read_pre_data128_from_file` function when reading data from a file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The function reads data from a file into a stack-allocated buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by overflowing the buffer on the stack.
- Program crash: The provided AddressSanitizer output shows that the overflow leads to a crash/abort due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- File input: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file used by the vulnerable function `FerretCOT::read_pre_data128_from_file`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the application that triggers the vulnerable function.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but rather needs access to the system running the vulnerable code.

**Technical details:**
- The overflow happens within the `emp::FerretCOT<emp::NetIO>::read_pre_data128_from_file` function, specifically at line 199 in `ferret_cot.hpp`.
- The ASAN output shows that the overflow occurs when writing 8 bytes to address `0x7ffe1879bc14` and `0x7ffcaefaca64`, which are located in the stack at an offset of 36 bytes in the stack frame.
- The overflow overwrites the `in_party` variable on the stack, which is allocated as a 4-byte variable located at offset 32, as shown in ASAN output.
- The `fread` function, called within `emp::FileIO::recv_data_internal`, is the source of the overflow because it doesn't validate the size before writing to the buffer.
- The vulnerability is reproducible with the provided steps that include recompiling the code with address sanitizer and running a test.
- The vulnerability is found in version `0.2.4` of the `emp-ot` library, specifically at commit `eb0daf2a7a88c44b419f6d1276dc19e66f80776f`.
