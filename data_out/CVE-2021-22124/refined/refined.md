- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The login modules of FortiSandbox and FortiAuthenticator are vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption when processing specifically crafted, long request parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can cause the affected device to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specifically crafted long request parameters to the login module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable login modules of FortiSandbox or FortiAuthenticator. No authentication is required.
