# Potential risk in the aws-deployment-framework which can lead to privilege escalation

High

## Package

aws-deployment-framework
(CloudFormation)

## Affected versions

<4.0.0

## Patched versions

4.0.0

## Description

### Summary

The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is an extensive and flexible framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization.

ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) while taking advantage of services such as [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), and [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup.

ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

### Impact

The bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the sts:AssumeRole operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account.

**Impacted versions: <4.0.0**

### Patches

The patches [1] are included in `aws-deployment-framework==4.0.0` [2].

### Workarounds

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary [3] to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
