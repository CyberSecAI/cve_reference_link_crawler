## v4.0.0

This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that

aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the

least-privilege principle.

**Key security enhancements include:**

* Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to

  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
* Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by

  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
* Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and

  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated

  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of

least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or

privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test

this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)

in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the

roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.

If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered

by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.

In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the

bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of

the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the

`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to

perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the

`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is

granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to

the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and

the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.

For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access

role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated

to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant

the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an

privileged escalation path.

This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.

By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the

cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you

modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like

the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the

cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline

it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild

project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.

Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access

role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described

above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.

Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged

cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update

the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit

too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if

they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to

non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected

will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially

deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.

It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited

permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or

AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some

level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the

management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a

deployment map could target the management account and create resources within

it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict

least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect

the management account.

Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to

ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed

and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.

These resources will only get deployed if the new

`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default

it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is

important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the

deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a

production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow

pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are

applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`

repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

  + If it does **not** contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you

    copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
  + If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file

    in that directory.
* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the

  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the

main deployment region to share artifacts from the

`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from

v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying

the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where

required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines

generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.

It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it

needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need

to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main

deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other

regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project

in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the

target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role

Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the

`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.

And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to

assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`

any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an

ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`

access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly

recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do

the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`

table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write

access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.

Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you

will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter

if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires

privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the

`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.

As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured

in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.

When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it

[least-privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.

This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions

across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation

actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation

Deployment role for the actual deployment.

The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the

CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you

use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the

CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other

services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for

specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is

allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.

It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service

only. You can find an example of this in the

`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the

CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the

`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access

in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the

`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets

except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,

CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by

ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the

role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.

If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require

the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the

`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.

Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF

pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to

`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.

As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to

another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made

writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the

`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after

removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,

without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from

v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket

policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF

components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy

files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these

to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur

on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies

that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit

(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.

Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is

supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md) carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider

following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an

upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.

If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade

these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define

the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would

default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer

supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.

Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this

change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and

IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.

This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and

whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix | Previous name | New prefix | New name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| / | ${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}-readonly | /adf/organizations/ | adf-organizations-readonly |
| / | adf-update-cross-account-access-role | /adf/bootstrap/ | adf-update-cross-account-access |
| /adf-automation/ | adf-create-repository-role | /adf/pipeline-management/ | adf-pipeline-management-create-repository |
| /adf-automation/ | adf-pipeline-provisioner-generate-inputs | /adf/pipeline-management/ | adf-pipeline-management-generate-inputs |

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain

and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.

For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their

`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the

default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to

`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the

CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack

deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating

that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`

parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
>
> operation: User:
>
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base\_update
>
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
>
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment\_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment\_account\_id
>
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
>
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
>
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters

they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application

code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically

prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`

prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when

you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these

parameters, so you can leave them as is.

Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in

SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,

and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment

account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports

it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections

for Bitbucket, GitHub, or GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS

CodeConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.

You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the

`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`

stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.

The changes you need to make are renaming the source

provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.

Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to

`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new

source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections

configuration as defined in the

[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or

GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

#### Installation improvements

With the addition of CDK v2 support. The dependencies that go with it,

unfortunately increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is supported

by the Serverless Application Repository. Hence the SAR installer is replaced

by a new installation process.

Please read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/installation-guide.md) how to install ADF.

In case you are upgrading, please follow [the admin guide on updating ADF](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions) instead.

`[v4.0.0](/sbkok/aws-deployment-framework/commit/b4f1830a9ed86d3ebbf93f54260d91f286d60c10 "v4.0.0

This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

`[b4f1830](/sbkok/aws-deployment-framework/commit/b4f1830a9ed86d3ebbf93f54260d91f286d60c10)`

```
This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html>)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege>)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md>)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions>).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html>).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

#### Installation improvements

With the addition of CDK v2 support. The dependencies that go with it,
unfortunately increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is supported
by the Serverless Application Repository. Hence the SAR installer is replaced
by a new installation process.
Please read the [Installation Guide](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/installation-guide.md>) how to install ADF.
In case you are upgrading, please follow [the admin guide on updating ADF](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions>) instead.

`[v4.0.0](/sbkok/aws-deployment-framework/commit/32f30fc704f9e00e094b9e5f2aa16b9118c2f4be "v4.0.0

This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

`[32f30fc](/sbkok/aws-deployment-framework/commit/32f30fc704f9e00e094b9e5f2aa16b9118c2f4be)`

```
This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html>)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege>)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md>)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions>).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html>).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

`[v4.0.0](/sbkok/aws-deployment-framework/commit/b463851d34829ec562dfe7a6215181540d8ec657 "v4.0.0

This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

#### Installation improvements

With the addition of CDK v2 support. The dependencies that go with it,
unfortunately increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is supported
by the Serverless Application Repository. Hence the SAR installer is replaced
by a new installation process.
Please read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/installation-guide.md) how to install ADF.
In case you are upgrading, please follow [the admin guide on updating ADF](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions) instead.

```
This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html>)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege>)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md>)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions>).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html>).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new

`[v4.0.0](/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/pull/732/commits/112dd6cf68c8c892f19d87fd32db5e132dbec04f "v4.0.0

This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

| Old Parameter Path           | New Parameter Path               |

| `/organization_id`           | `/adf/organization_id`              |

For the __deployment account__, in __other ADF regions__:

| Old Parameter Path           | New Parameter Path               |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/adf_log_level`             | `/adf/adf_log_level`             |

| `/kms_arn`               | `/adf/kms_arn`               |

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

#### Installation improvements

With the addition of CDK v2 support. The dependencies that go with it,
unfortunately increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is supported
by the Serverless Application Repository. Hence the SAR installer is replaced
by a new installation process.
Please read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/installation-guide.md) how to install ADF.
In case you are upgrading, please follow [the admin guide on updating ADF](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/make/latest/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions) instead.

`[112dd6c](/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/pull/732/commits/112dd6cf68c8c892f19d87fd32db5e132dbec04f)`

```
This is a security-focused release of the AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) that
aims to restrict the default access required and provided by ADF via the
least-privilege principle.

__Key security enhancements include:__

- Applying IAM best practices by restricting excessive permissions granted to
  IAM roles and policies used by ADF.
- Leveraging new IAM features to further limit access privileges granted by
  default, reducing the potential attack surface.
- Where privileged access is required for specific ADF use cases, the scope and
  duration of elevated privileges have been minimized to limit the associated
  risks.

By implementing these security improvements, ADF now follows the principle of
least privilege, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or
privilege-escalation attacks.

Please make sure to go through the list of changes breaking changes carefully.

As with every release, it is strongly recommended to thoroughly review and test
this version of ADF in a non-production environment first.

### Breaking changes

#### Security: Confused Deputy Problem

Addressed the [Confused Deputy
problem](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html>)
in IAM roles created by ADF to use by the AWS Services. Where supported, the
roles are restricted to specific resources via an `aws:SourceArn` condition.
If you were using the ADF roles for other resources or use cases not covered
by ADF, you might need to patch the Assume Role policies accordingly.

#### Security: Cross-Account Access Role and the new Jump Role

ADF relies on the privileged Cross-Account Access Role to bootstrap accounts.
In the past, ADF used this role for every update and deployment of the
bootstrap stacks, as well as account management features.

With the release of v4.0, a jump role is introduced to lock-down the usage of
the privileged cross-account access role. Part of the bootstrap stack, the
`adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is created. This role grants access to
perform restricted updates that are frequently performed via the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline. By default, the jump role is
granted access to assume into this update deployment role.

A dedicated jump role manager is responsible to grant the jump role access to
the cross-account access role for AWS accounts where ADF requires access and
the `adf-bootstrap-update-deployment-role` is not available yet.
For example, accounts that are newly created only have the cross-account access
role to assume into. Same holds for ADF managed accounts that are not updated
to the new v4.0 bootstrap stack yet.

During the installation/update of ADF, a new parameter enables you to grant
the jump role temporary access to the cross-account access role as an
privileged escalation path.
This parameter is called `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil`.
By setting this to a date/time in the future you will grant access to the
cross-account access role until that date/time. This would be required if you
modify ADF itself or the bootstrap stack templates. Changing permissions like
the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role` is possible without relying on the
cross-account access role. For most changes deployed via the bootstrap pipeline
it does not require elevated privileged access to update.

With the above changes, the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` CodeBuild
project no longer has unrestricted access to the privileged cross-account role.
Starting from version 4.0, access to assume the privileged cross-account access
role is restricted and must be obtained through the Jump Role as described
above.

#### Security: Restricted account management access

Account Management is able to access non-protected organization units.
Prior to ADF v4.0, the account management process used the privileged
cross-account assess role to operate. Hence it could move an account or update
the properties of an account that is located in a protected organization unit
too. With the release of v4.0, it is only able to move or manage accounts if
they are accessible via the Jump Role. The Jump Role is restricted to
non-protected organization units only.

This enhances the security of ADF, as defining a organization unit as protected
will block access to that via the Jump Role accordingly.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of management account

The `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack in the management account was initially
deployed to facilitate bootstrap access to the management account.
It accomplished this by creating a cross-account access role with limited
permissions in the management account ahead of the bootstrapping process.

ADF created this role as it is not provisioned by AWS Organizations or
AWS Control Tower in the management account itself. However, ADF required some
level of access to deploy the necessary bootstrap stacks when needed.

It is important to note that deploying this role and bootstrapping the
management account introduces a potential risk. A pipeline created via a
deployment map could target the management account and create resources within
it, which may have unintended consequences.

To mitigate the potential risk, it is recommended to implement strict
least-privilege policies and apply permission boundaries to protect
the management account.
Additionally, thoroughly reviewing all deployment map changes is crucial to
ensure no unintended access is granted to the management account.

With the release of ADF v4.0, the `adf-global-base-adf-build` stack is removed
and its resources are moved to the main ADF CloudFormation template.
These resources will only get deployed if the new
`AllowBootstrappingOfManagementAccount` parameter is set to `Yes`. By default
it will not allow bootstrapping of the management account.

#### Security: Restricted bootstrapping of deployment account

Considering the sensitive workloads that run in the deployment account, it is
important to limit the permissions granted for pipelines to deploy to the
deployment account itself. You should consider the deployment account a
production account.

It is recommended to apply the least-privilege principle and only allow
pipelines to deploy resources that are required in the deployment account.

Follow these steps after the changes introduced by the ADF v4.0 release are
applied in the main branch of the `aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap`
repository.

Please take this moment to review the following:

* Navigate to the `adf-boostrap/deployment` folder in that repository.
* Check if it contains a `global-iam.yml` file:

    * If it does __not__ contain a `global-iam.yml` file yet, please ensure you
      copy the `example-global-iam.yml` file in that directory.
    * If it does, please compare it against the `example-global-iam.yml` file
      in that directory.

* Apply the least-privilege principle on the permissions you grant in the
  deployment account.

#### Security: Shared Modules Bucket

ADF uses the Shared Modules Bucket as hosted in the management account in the
main deployment region to share artifacts from the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

The breaking change enforces all objects to be owned by the bucket owner from
v4.0 onward.

#### Security: ADF Role policy restrictions

With the v4.0 release, all ADF roles and policies were reviewed, applying
the latest best-practices and granting access to ADF resources only where
required. This review also includes the roles that were used by the pipelines
generated by ADF.

Please be aware of the changes made to the following roles:

##### adf-codecommit-role

The `adf-codecommit-role` no longer grants read/write access to all buckets.
It only grants access to the buckets created and managed by ADF where it
needed to. Please grant access accordingly if you use custom S3 buckets or need
to copy from an S3 bucket in an ADF-generated pipeline.

##### adf-codebuild-role

The `adf-codebuild-role` can only be used by CodeBuild projects in the main
deployment region. ADF did not allow running CodeBuild projects in other
regions before. But in case you manually configured the role in a project
in a different region it will fail to launch.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is no longer allowed to assume any IAM Role in the
target accounts if those roles would grant access in the Assume Role
Policy Document.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is restricted to assume only the
`adf-readonly-automation-role` roles in the target accounts.
And, in the case that the Terraform ADF Extension is enabled, it is allowed to
assume the `adf-terraform-role` too.

It is therefore not allowed to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`
any longer. If you were deploying with `cdk deploy` into target accounts from an
ADF pipeline you will need to specifically grant the `adf-codebuild-role`
access to assume the `adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. However, we strongly
recommend you synthesize the templates instead and let AWS CloudFormation do
the deployment for you.

For Terraform support, CodeBuild was granted access to the `adf-tflocktable`
table in release v3.2.0. This access is restricted to only grant read/write
access to that table if the Terraform extension is enabled.
Please bear in mind that if you enable Terraform access the first time, you
will need to use the `GrantOrgWidePrivilegedBootstrapAccessUntil` parameter
if ADF v4.0 bootstrapped to accounts before. As this operation requires
privileged access.

The `adf-codebuild-role` is allowed to assume into the
`adf-terraform-role` if the Terraform extension is enabled.
As written in the docs, the `adf-terraform-role` is configured
in the `global-iam.yml` file. This role is commented out by default.
When you define this role, it is important to make sure to grant it
[least-privilege access](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege>)
only.

##### adf-cloudformation-role

The `adf-cloudformation-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation.
This role is used by CodePipeline to orchestrate various deployment actions
across accounts. For example, CodeDeploy, S3, and obviously the CloudFormation
actions.

For CloudFormation, it would instruct the service to use the CloudFormation
Deployment role for the actual deployment.
The CloudFormation deployment role is the role that is assumed by the
CloudFormation service. This change should not impact you, unless you
use this role in relation with CloudFormation that is not managed by ADF.

With v4.0, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is only allowed to pass the
CloudFormation Deployment role to CloudFormation and no other roles to other
services.

If you were/want to make use of a custom CloudFormation deployment role for
specific pipelines, you need to make sure that the `adf-cloudformation-role` is
allowed to perform an `iam:PassRole` action with the given role.
It is recommended to limit this to be passed to the CloudFormation service
only. You can find an example of this in the
`adf-bootstrap/deployment/global.yml` file where it allows the
CloudFormation role to perform `iam:PassRole` with the
`adf-cloudformation-deployment-role`. When required, please grant this access
in the `adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml` file in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` repository.

Additionally, the `adf-cloudformation-role` is not allowed to access S3 buckets
except the ADF buckets it needs to transfer pipeline assets to CloudFormation.

##### adf-codepipeline-role

The `adf-codepipeline-role` is no longer assumable by CloudFormation,
CodeDeploy, and S3. The role itself was not passed to any of these services by
ADF.

If you relied on the permissions that were removed, feel free to extend the
role permissions via the `global-iam.yml` stack.

#### Security: Restricted access to ADF-managed S3 buckets only

With v4.0, access is restricted to ADF-managed S3 buckets only.
If a pipeline used the S3 source or deployment provider, it will require
the required access to those buckets. Please add the required access to the
`global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack in the OU where it is hosted.

Grant read access to the `adf-codecommit-role` for S3 source buckets.
Grant write access to the `adf-cloudformation-role` for S3 buckets an ADF
pipeline deploys to.

#### Security: Bootstrap stack no longer named after organization unit

The global and regional bootstrap stacks are renamed to
`adf-global-base-bootstrap` and `adf-regional-base-bootstrap` respectively.

In prior releases of ADF, the name ended with the organization unit name.
As a result, an account could not move from one organization unit to
another without first removing the bootstrap stacks. Additionally, it made
writing IAM policies and SCPs harder in a least-privilege way.

When ADF v4.0 is installed, the legacy stacks will get removed by the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap` pipeline automatically. Shortly after
removal, it will deploy the new bootstrap stacks.

With v4.0, accounts can move from one organization unit to another,
without requiring the removal of the ADF bootstrap stacks.

#### Security: KMS Encryption required on Deployment Account Pipeline Buckets

The deployment account pipeline buckets only accepts KMS Encrypted objects from
v4.0 onward. Ensuring that all objects are encrypted with the same KMS Key.

Before, some objects used KMS encryption while others did not. The bucket
policy now requires all objects to be encrypted via the KMS key. All ADF
components have been adjusted to upload with this key. If, however, you copy
files from systems that are not managed by ADF, you will need to adjust these
to encrypt the objects with the KMS key as well.

#### Security: TLS Encryption required on all ADF-managed buckets

S3 Buckets created by ADF will require TLS 1.2 or later. All actions that occur
on these buckets with older TLS versions will be denied via the bucket policies
that these buckets received.

#### New installer

The dependencies that are bundled by the move to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK) v2 increased the deployment size of ADF.
Unfortunately it increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is
supported by the Serverless Application Repository (SAR).

Hence a new installation mechanism is required.

Please read the [installation
instructions](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/installation-guide.md>)
carefully.

In case you are upgrading an existing installation of ADF, please consider
following the [upgrade steps as defined in the admin
guide](<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-deployment-framework/blob/master/docs/admin-guide.md#updating-between-versions>).

#### CDK v2

ADF v4.0 is built on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2. Which is an
upgrade to CDK v1 that ADF relied on before.

For most end-users, this change would not have an immediate impact.
If, however, you made customizations to ADF it might require you to upgrade
these customizations to CDK v2 as well.

#### CodeBuild default image

As written in the [CodeBuild provider
docs](./docs/providers-guide.md#properties-3), it is a best-practice to define
the exact CodeBuild container image you would like to use for each pipeline.

However, in case you rely on the default, in prior ADF releases it would
default to `UBUNTU_14_04_PYTHON_3_7_1`. This container image is no longer
supported. With ADF v4.0, the new default is `STANDARD_7_0`.
Also referred to as: `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`.

#### ADF Renaming of Roles

ADF v4.0 changes most of the roles that it relies on. The reason for this
change is to make it easier to secure ADF with Service Control Policies and
IAM permission boundaries. Where applicable, the roles received a new prefix.
This makes it easier to identify what part of ADF relies on those roles and
whom should have access to assume the role or modify it.

| Previous prefix  | Previous name                                                       | New prefix                 | New name                                                      |

#### ADF Parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

Some of the parameters stored by ADF in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
were located at the root of the Parameter Store. This made it hard to maintain
and restrict access to the limited set of ADF specific parameters.

With ADF v4.0, the parameters used by ADF are located under the `/adf/` prefix.
For example, `/adf/deployment_account_id`.

The `global-iam.yml` bootstrap stack templates get copied from their
`example-global-iam.yml` counterparts. When this was copied in v3.2.0, the
default path for the `deployment_account_id` parameter should be updated to
`/adf/deployment_account_id`. Please apply this new default value to the
CloudFormation templates accordingly. If you forget to do this, the stack
deployment of the `adf-global-base-iam` stack might fail with a failure stating
that it does not have permission to fetch the `deployment_account_id`
parameter.

The error you run into if the parameter path is not updated:

> An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet
> operation: User:
> arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/${CrossAccountAccessRoleName}/base_update
> is not authorized to perform: ssm:GetParameters on resource:
> arn:aws:ssm:${deployment_region}:111111111111:parameter/deployment_account_id
> because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:GetParameters action
> (Service: AWSSimpleSystemsManagement; Status Code: 400;
> Error Code: AccessDeniedException; Request ID: xxx).

If an application or customization to ADF relies on one of these parameters
they will need to be updated to include this prefix. Unless the application
code relies on ADF's ParameterStore class, in that case it will automatically
prefix the `/adf/` to all parameters read or written.

With the changes in the IAM policies, ADF's access is restricted to the `/adf/`
prefix. This, unfortunately implies that old parameters are not deleted when
you update your installation of ADF. There is no cost associated to these
parameters, so you can leave them as is.
Feel free to delete the old parameters.

The parameters that are managed by ADF that got their path changed are:

For the __management account__, in the __AWS Organizations region__
(`us-east-1`, or `us-gov-west-1`):

#### AWS CodeStar Connections OAuth Token support dropped

ADF v4.0 discontinued the support for the OAuth Token stored in
SSM Parameter Store. As this method is not advised to be used by CodePipeline,
and might leave the OAuth Token accessible to other users of the deployment
account. As this is not a security best practice, ADF v4.0 no longer supports
it.

To upgrade, please read the [Administrator Guide on Using AWS CodeConnections
for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-github-enterprise-or-gitlab).

#### AWS CodeStar Connections changed to AWS CodeConnections

The AWS CodeStar Connection service [changed its name to AWS
CodeConnections](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/rename.html>).

If you configured a CodeStar Connection before, you can continue to use that.
You do not need to update the CodeStar policy as defined in the
`aws-deployment-framework-bootstrap/adf-bootstrap/deployment/global-iam.yml`
stack.

However, please update the pipeline definitions in your deployment map files.
The changes you need to make are renaming the source
provider from `codestar` to `codeconnections`.
Also update the `codestar_connection_path` source property to
`codeconnections_param_path`.

Both of these changes can be seen in the following example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: sample-vpc
    default_providers:
      source:
        # provider: codestar
        provider: codeconnections
        properties:
          # codestar_connection_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
          codeconnections_param_path: /adf/my_connection_arn_param
```

If you are upgrading from the GitHub OAuth token or otherwise require a new
source code connection, please proceed with the AWS CodeConnections
configuration as defined in the
[Admin Guide - Using AWS CodeConnections for Bitbucket, GitHub, or
GitLab](./docs/admin-guide.md#using-aws-codeconnections-for-bitbucket-github-or-gitlab).

#### Installation improvements

With the addition of CDK v2 support. The dependencies that go with it,
unfortunately increased the deployment size beyond the limit that is supported
by the Serverless Application Repository. Hence the SAR installer is replaced
by a new installation process.
