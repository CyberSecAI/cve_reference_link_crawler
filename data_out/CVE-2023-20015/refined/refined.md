- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of commands supplied by the user in the CLI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An authenticated, local attacker can inject unauthorized commands within the CLI.
    - An attacker with *Administrator* privileges on Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root*-level privileges.
    - Other affected products allow a low-privileged user to access some unauthorized unprivileged commands within the CLI, but not on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected command via the CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated locally to the device. For root-level access on UCS 6400 and 6500 series fabric interconnects, the attacker needs *Administrator* privileges.
