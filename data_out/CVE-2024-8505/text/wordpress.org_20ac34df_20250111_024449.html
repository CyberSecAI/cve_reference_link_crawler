Settings. I don’t even understand what this is all about.
I want “Load More’ at the bottom of the blog section on the front page. This doesn’t even need a setting, and should work instantly after activation. This is true about quite a number of WP plugins. All this acrobatics for a simple purpose?

This is a great plugin if you’re trying to do any AJAX load more functionality and filtering. Well maintained and supported, it makes it so easy to implement some complicated design systems. Great documentation with a lot of hooks and filters also makes it really easy to customize and create really cool designs. The few times I’ve ran into trouble, the plugin developer has been very responsive and helpful. If I could give 10 stars I would 🙂
