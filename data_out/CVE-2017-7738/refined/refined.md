Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-7738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that an administrator with `super_admin` privileges can use the `fnsysctl` CLI command to view current SSL-VPN web portal session information, which includes user credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: User credentials for the SSL-VPN portal are exposed to a privileged admin through the `fnsysctl` command.
- Improper Access Control: The `fnsysctl` command, designed for system control, is improperly allowing access to sensitive user data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who has compromised a super_admin account can use the `fnsysctl` command to view the credentials of currently logged-in users of the SSL-VPN web portal. This could allow the attacker to gain access to the VPN using valid user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- CLI Access: An attacker needs access to the FortiOS command-line interface (CLI) and a valid super_admin account.
- Privilege Escalation (indirect): An attacker who gains access to a lower-privilege account can escalate to a super_admin to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must possess a super_admin account.
- Attacker must have CLI access.
