    *   Deleting arbitrary files
    *   Other unspecified actions

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited via AJAX actions. This means attackers can send specially crafted requests to the WordPress site's AJAX interface to trigger the vulnerable functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Summary**

The Kaswara Modern VC Addons plugin is vulnerable due to missing authorization checks on AJAX actions. This allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to perform a variety of malicious actions, like data import, file uploads, and file deletions. This vulnerability can have a significant impact on a WordPress site.
