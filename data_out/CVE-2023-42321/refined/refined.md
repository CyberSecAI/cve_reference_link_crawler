{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the session handling mechanism of iCMS V7.0.16, where session hijacking allows unauthorized actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Permissions due to the ability to hijack sessions and arbitrarily add members, roles, and administrator accounts without proper authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary addition of user accounts with elevated privileges (members, roles, administrators), information disclosure, and potentially code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves hijacking the session.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to hijack an active session. The attack is classified as remote."
