The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6482.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing capability check and a lack of validation on user-supplied data within the `lwp_update_password_action` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Privilege Management**: The plugin fails to properly validate user input and check user capabilities before allowing them to update their user role. This allows an authenticated user with minimal privileges to escalate their role to administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker with subscriber-level access can gain administrator privileges, allowing them to perform administrative tasks such as taking over the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated attackers (Subscriber+) can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have at least a subscriber level access.
- The attacker can send a crafted request to the `lwp_update_password_action` function in order to modify their own user role.
- Exploitation in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49 required the pro plugin.
