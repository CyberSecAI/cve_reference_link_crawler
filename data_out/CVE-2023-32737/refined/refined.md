- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the affected applications not properly restricting the .NET BinaryFormatter when deserializing user-controllable input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). The .NET BinaryFormatter is used without proper restrictions leading to type confusion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a type confusion and execute arbitrary code within the affected application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the machine running the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) and user interaction (UI:R for v3.1, UI:P for v4.0)  to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must also have the ability to upload PLC software from untrusted devices or MMC cards.
