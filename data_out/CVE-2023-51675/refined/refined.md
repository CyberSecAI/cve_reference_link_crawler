- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of redirect URLs, allowing a malicious actor to redirect users to arbitrary websites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious actor can redirect users from a legitimate site to a malicious one, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  A malicious actor crafts a URL that leverages the vulnerable redirect functionality. When a user clicks on this malicious URL they are redirected to an attacker controlled website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that will be processed by the vulnerable application.
