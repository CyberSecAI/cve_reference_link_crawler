```
Revision history for Plack-Middleware-XSRFBlock

0.0.19    2023-07-14 10:17:10+01:00 Europe/London
 - SECURITY FIX! when *not* using signed cookies, it was possible to
   bypass XSRFBlock by POSTing an empty form value and an empty cookie
 - bump minimum perl version to 5.12, most dependencies already
   require it

0.0.18    2023-07-13 10:16:20+01:00 Europe/London
 - when invoking the `blocked` callback/app, log as `info` instead of
   `error` (@pangyre) (#27)

0.0.17    2022-10-17 10:57:09+01:00 Europe/London
 - remove internal _token_generator (wasn't documented, couldn't
   really be changed without also changing invalid_signature, and
   produced a ref loop)

0.0.16    2018-07-25 14:23:36+01:00 Europe/London
 - don't use Data::Printer (@dakkar) (#24)

0.0.15    2018-07-24 13:44:11+01:00 Europe/London

0.0.12    2017-07-13 06:35:46-04:00 America/New_York

 - dzil: Replace NoTabsTests with Test::NoTabs
 - fix #15: Use magic comment to crowbar in an essential dependency
 - add magic comments for other author dependencies that aren't auto-detected

 - re-arrange POD in file; so method POD appears in a sensible location

 - Set cookie once we know we have HTML (issue #12)
 - Update POD docs with inject_form_input field docs (pull #10)

0.0.6     2014-08-05 20:47:11+00:00 UTC
 - Pass app() to 'blocked' sub (pull #8)

0.0.5     2014-07-22 15:28:43+00:00 UTC
