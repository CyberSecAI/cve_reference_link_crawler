## Description

Issue warning about `allowed_urls` when default value is used.

The default value is `file://.*|http(s)?://.*`

Fixes [#2531](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/2531)

## Feature/Issue validation/testing

* Without `allowed_urls` configured

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store model_store
$ WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
2023-08-22T11:29:05,267 [WARN ] main org.pytorch.serve.util.ConfigManager - Your torchserve instance can access any URL to load models. When deploying to production, make sure to limit the set of allowed_urls in config.properties
2023-08-22T11:29:05,271 [INFO ] main org.pytorch.serve.servingsdk.impl.PluginsManager - Initializing plugins manager...
..........

```

* With `allowed_urls` configured

```
$ cat custom_config.properties
allowed_urls="https://torchserve.pytorch.org/mar_files/.*"
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store model_store --ts-config custom_config.properties
$ WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.

This is the release of TorchServe v0.8.2.

## Security

* Updated snakeyaml version to v2 [#2523](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2523) @nskool
* Added warning about model allowed urls when default value is applied [#2534](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2534) [@namannandan](https://github.com/namannandan)

## Custom metrics backwards compatibility

* `add_metric` is now backwards compatible with versions [< v0.6.1] but the default metric type is inferred to be `COUNTER`. If the metric is of a different type, it will need to be specified in the call to `add_metric` as follows:

  `metrics.add_metric(name='GenericMetric', value=10, unit='count', dimensions=[...], metric_type=MetricTypes.GAUGE)`
* When upgrading from versions [v0.6.1 - v0.8.1] to v0.8.2, replace the call to `add_metric` with `add_metric_to_cache`.
* All custom metrics updated in the custom handler will need to be included in the metrics configuration file for them to be emitted by Torchserve. This is shown [here](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/58eb2d2c79cf1cf711abf9ffea5678420a5ff65a/docs/metrics.md#central-metrics-yaml-file-definition).
* A detailed [upgrade guide](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/04e0b37dafbd9f98a60d040bbc36f64016fc2c8d/docs/metrics.md#backwards-compatibility-warnings-and-upgrade-guide) is included in the [metrics documentation](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/04e0b37dafbd9f98a60d040bbc36f64016fc2c8d/docs/metrics.md).

## New Features

* Supported KServe GPRC v2 [#2176](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2176) [@jagadeeshi2i](https://github.com/jagadeeshi2i)

3. DeepSpeed deferred init with OPT-30B [#2419](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2419) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

   * This PR added feature `deferred model init` in [OPT-30B example](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples/large_models/deepspeed) by leveraging DeepSpeed new version. This feature is able to significantly reduce model loading latency.
4. Torch TensorRT example [#2483](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2483) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

5. K8S mnist example using minikube [#2323](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2323) [@agunapal](https://github.com/agunapal)

   * This example shows how to use a pre-trained custom MNIST model to performing real time Digit recognition via K8S.
6. Example for custom metrics [#2516](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2516) [@namannandan](https://github.com/namannandan)

# TorchServe SSRF

High

[namannandan](/namannandan)
published
GHSA-8fxr-qfr9-p34w
Sep 28, 2023

## Package

torchserve

## Affected versions

0.1.0 >= 0.8.1

## Patched versions

0.8.2

## Description

## Impact

**Remote Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

**Issue**: TorchServe default configuration lacks proper input validation, enabling third parties to invoke remote HTTP download requests and write files to the disk. This issue could be taken advantage of to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive data. This issue is present in versions `0.1.0` to `0.8.1`.

**Mitigation**: The user is able to load the model of their choice from any URL that they would like to use. The user of TorchServe is responsible for configuring both the [allowed\_urls](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/b3eced56b4d9d5d3b8597aa506a0bcf954d291bc/docs/configuration.md?plain=1#L296) and specifying the model URL to be used. A pull request to warn the user when the default value for `allowed_urls` is used has been merged - [#2534](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2534). TorchServe release `0.8.2` includes this change.

## Patches

## TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes fixes to address the previously listed issue:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
