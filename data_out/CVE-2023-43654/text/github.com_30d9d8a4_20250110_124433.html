# TorchServe SSRF

High

[namannandan](/namannandan)
published
GHSA-8fxr-qfr9-p34w
Sep 28, 2023

## Package

torchserve

## Affected versions

0.1.0 >= 0.8.1

## Patched versions

0.8.2

## Description

## Impact

**Remote Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

**Issue**: TorchServe default configuration lacks proper input validation, enabling third parties to invoke remote HTTP download requests and write files to the disk. This issue could be taken advantage of to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive data. This issue is present in versions `0.1.0` to `0.8.1`.

**Mitigation**: The user is able to load the model of their choice from any URL that they would like to use. The user of TorchServe is responsible for configuring both the [allowed\_urls](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/b3eced56b4d9d5d3b8597aa506a0bcf954d291bc/docs/configuration.md?plain=1#L296) and specifying the model URL to be used. A pull request to warn the user when the default value for `allowed_urls` is used has been merged - [#2534](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2534). TorchServe release `0.8.2` includes this change.

## Patches

## TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes fixes to address the previously listed issue:

<https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.8.2>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
