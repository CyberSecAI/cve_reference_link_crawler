## Description

Issue warning about `allowed_urls` when default value is used.

The default value is `file://.*|http(s)?://.*`

Fixes [#2531](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/2531)

## Feature/Issue validation/testing

* Without `allowed_urls` configured

```
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store model_store
$ WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
2023-08-22T11:29:05,267 [WARN ] main org.pytorch.serve.util.ConfigManager - Your torchserve instance can access any URL to load models. When deploying to production, make sure to limit the set of allowed_urls in config.properties
2023-08-22T11:29:05,271 [INFO ] main org.pytorch.serve.servingsdk.impl.PluginsManager - Initializing plugins manager...
..........

```

* With `allowed_urls` configured

```
$ cat custom_config.properties
allowed_urls="https://torchserve.pytorch.org/mar_files/.*"
$ torchserve --ncs --start --model-store model_store --ts-config custom_config.properties
$ WARNING: sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass is not supported. This will impact performance.
