Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-20772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the failure of the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager to properly sanitize input values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTTP Response Splitting: The application is susceptible to HTTP response splitting attacks due to inadequate input sanitization.
- HTTP Header Injection: Attackers can inject malicious HTTP headers.
- Response Body Control: Attackers gain the ability to control the response body.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can manipulate the HTTP response by injecting malicious headers, controlling the response body, and splitting the response into multiple responses. This could potentially lead to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- User Interaction: The user needs to interact with the manipulated response in some way to be affected

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to a vulnerable Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) or Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager.
- No special privileges are needed
