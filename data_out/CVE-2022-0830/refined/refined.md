- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FormBuilder plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when creating, updating, and deleting forms. Additionally, the plugin doesn't sanitize or escape form field values properly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CSRF vulnerability:  The absence of CSRF checks allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  Due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of form field values, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields. This code is then stored in the database and executed when the form is viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Attackers can manipulate form data, including updating and deleting arbitrary forms.
    -  Attackers can inject XSS payloads into form fields, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions when a victim views the form.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - CSRF: An attacker crafts a malicious request that targets the vulnerable form actions, tricking a logged-in administrator into executing the request.
    - Stored XSS: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code via form fields which gets stored in the database, and is executed when the form is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a malicious request (CSRF).
    - The attacker needs to have the capability to craft HTTP requests containing the malicious payloads (both CSRF and XSS).
    -  The attacker doesn't need an account on the target website, they can simply send the malicious requests when a logged in admin is active.
