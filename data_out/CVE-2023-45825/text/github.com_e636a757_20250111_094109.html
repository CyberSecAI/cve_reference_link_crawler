# Token in custom credentials object can leak through logs

Moderate

## Package

gomod

ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v3.48.6

## Patched versions

v3.53.3

## Description

### Impact

Since [ydb-go-sdk/v3.48.6](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/v3.48.6/internal/balancer/balancer.go#L71) if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface [Credentials](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/master/credentials/credentials.go#L10)) it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf("something went wrong (credentials: %q)", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. Printf func use placeholder `%q` for string representation of argument with quotes. If an argument implements interface `fmt.Stringer`, it will used through `String()` func. In other cases used fallback - serialization with reflection.

If such logging occurred, a malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database.

Who is impacted: applications with custom credentials object with an explicit token field.

A leak could have occurred if all of these conditions were met simultaneously:

1. The credentials object does not implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface (does not have a `String()` method) - potentially these are custom credentials. Official credentials have a `String()` method.
2. There was an error connecting to YDB during driver creation via `ydb.Open(...)`.
3. Some logging system was configured (`ydb-go-sdk` does not log such errors by default).
4. The connection error was logged into a system that a malicious user had access to.

### Patches

`ydb-go-sdk` contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in version v3.53.3 ([PR](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/pull/859)).

### Workarounds

Implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
