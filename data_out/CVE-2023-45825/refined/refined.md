Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2023-45825.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the potential for custom credentials objects to leak sensitive information (specifically tokens) through logs.
- This occurs because the `fmt.Errorf` function, used during connection errors, can serialize the credentials object into an error message string. If the credentials object does not implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface, Go's reflection mechanism is used for string conversion which can expose the token value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-532:**  Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. The application logs sensitive information such as authentication tokens.
- The `ydb-go-sdk` library versions v3.48.6 to v3.53.2 did not properly sanitize custom credentials objects when logging connection errors, leading to potential exposure.
- Lack of sanitization of custom credentials objects within error messages.
- The use of `%q` format specifier with `fmt.Errorf`, intended for string representation with quotes, triggers the `String()` method of the object if it is implemented, otherwise the default reflection-based string conversion is used that may expose sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user with access to the logs could extract sensitive credential information (e.g., tokens).
- With the leaked tokens, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the YDB database.
- The severity is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.5.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local as the attacker needs access to the logs where the sensitive information is leaked.
- Low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must have access to the log files where the error messages containing the serialized credentials object are written.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `ydb-go-sdk` versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2.
- The fix was implemented in version v3.53.3 by ensuring that credentials objects are properly stringified, which likely means implementing the `fmt.Stringer` interface to avoid leaking token information.
- The vulnerability only affects applications using custom credential objects (i.e. not the built-in ones), which do not implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface.

**Workaround:**
- Implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state.
