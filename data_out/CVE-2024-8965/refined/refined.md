Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'Name' field when creating custom post criteria in the Absolute Reviews plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses a page with the injected review box.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to: redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, defacing websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An authenticated attacker (with Contributor-level access or higher) can inject malicious scripts via the 'Name' field of a custom post criteria.
- The injected script is stored in the database and executed when the plugin renders the review box in a webpage visited by other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs the ability to create custom post criteria within the Absolute Reviews plugin.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in Absolute Reviews plugin versions 1.1.3 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.4.
- The provided trac changeset shows the update of the javascript that was used to set the signature. It was updated to use `$('<div>').text( ... ).html()` instead of string concatenation that was previously used. This was done to properly encode HTML entities.
