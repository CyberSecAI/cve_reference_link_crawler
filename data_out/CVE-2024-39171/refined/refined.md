The provided content relates to CVE-2024-39171.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of HTTP request parameters in `upload-ffmpeg.php`, `upload-mp3.php`, and `upload.php` files within PHPVibe CMS. Specifically, the 'token' parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The lack of input validation on the `token` parameter allows attackers to manipulate the file path, enabling them to write files to arbitrary locations within the webserver's file system.
- Unrestricted File Upload: The vulnerability allows for writing files with specific suffixes (like .htaccess or .php) to any path, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new malicious ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Write: Attackers can write files to any location accessible by the web server.
- Remote Code Execution: By writing a malicious PHP file, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Website Defacement: Attackers can overwrite key files, including `.htaccess`, potentially disrupting website functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Requests: Attackers send specially crafted GET requests with a malicious `token` parameter.
- File Extension Manipulation:  Attackers can control the extension of the written file via the `$ext` variable, typically derived from the provided `$filename`,  allowing them to write files like `.htaccess` or `.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable PHPVibe CMS instance.
- Ability to send HTTP GET requests.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable files are: `./app/uploading/upload-ffmpeg.php`, `./app/uploading/upload-mp3.php`, and `./app/uploading/upload.php`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions 11.0.3 to 11.0.46 of PHPVibe.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows how to write a file to the web root.
- The fix involves blacklisting the `.htaccess` extension.
