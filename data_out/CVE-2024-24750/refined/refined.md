Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a backpressure issue within the `fetch()` function of the `undici` library in Node.js. Specifically, when the response body is not consumed or is consumed slowly, it leads to a memory leak. The issue is related to how the ReadableStream is handled and the lack of proper backpressure management when data is being read from the underlying socket, which can lead to unbounded buffering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by improper handling of backpressure when consuming the response body of a `fetch()` request. If the response body is not consumed or is consumed slowly, the data will buffer indefinitely, leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Lack of backpressure management:** The code does not properly handle the backpressure mechanism of the ReadableStream, causing an unbounded buffer of data that is not consumed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service condition because the application consumes all available memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered over the network by making requests using the `fetch()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges.
- **User Interaction Required:** Although the vulnerability does not require a user to directly perform an action to be exploited, it relies on the user's application not properly consuming the fetched response body.
- **Ability to send requests that cause the response body to grow and not be consumed:** The attacker can initiate requests where the response body is large, or is streamed, and ensure the application does not consume the body or does so at a slow pace, leading to the memory leak.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `undici` versions `6.0.0` up to and including `6.6.0`.
- The fix is included in version `6.6.1`.
- The CVSS score is `6.5 (MEDIUM)`, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
- A GitHub commit `87a48113f1f68f60aa09abb07276d7c35467c663` addresses this issue by implementing proper backpressure management in the `fetch()` function. Specifically, it passes a `ByteLengthQueuingStrategy` to the `ReadableStream` to limit the buffer size.

The provided information gives a good understanding of the memory leak vulnerability due to improper handling of backpressure in the `fetch()` implementation of the `undici` library.
