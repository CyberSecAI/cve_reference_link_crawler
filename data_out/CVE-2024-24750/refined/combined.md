So instead it should look like:  ``` const readableStream = new ReadableStream({  pull () {},  // ... }, new ByteLengthQueuingStrategy({ highWaterMark: 16384 })) ```      All reactions          This comment has been minimized.

# Backpressure request ignored in fetch()

published
GHSA-9f24-jqhm-jfcw
Feb 16, 2024

## Package

npm

undici
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 6.0.0 <= 6.6.0

## Patched versions

6.6.1

## Description

### Impact

Calling `fetch(url)` and not consuming the incoming body ((or consuming it very slowing) will lead to a memory leak.

### Patches

Patched in v6.6.1

### Workarounds

Make sure to always consume the incoming body.

### Severity

Moderate

6.5

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
