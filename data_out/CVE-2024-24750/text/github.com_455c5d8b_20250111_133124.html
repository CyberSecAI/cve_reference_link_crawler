Copy link    Quote reply     @KhafraDev **[KhafraDev](/KhafraDev)** [Feb 8, 2024](#r138446550) Member   [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina) I'm pretty sure this is the only thing needed for the fix, unless node implements its own options (which aren't documented)? queuingStrategy is the second param passed to streams and ReadableStream doesn't have a highWatermark option. So instead it should look like:  ``` const readableStream = new ReadableStream({  pull () {},  // ... }, new ByteLengthQueuingStrategy({ highWaterMark: 16384 })) ```      All reactions          This comment has been minimized.
