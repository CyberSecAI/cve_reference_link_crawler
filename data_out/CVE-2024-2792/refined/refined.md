**1. Verification:**

*   The content directly references CVE-2024-2792 and describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   It mentions the affected plugin ("Elementor Addon Elements") and its vulnerable version range (<= 1.13.2).
*   The provided code diffs show changes in the plugin code which are related to escaping user inputs, and sanitization

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within specific widgets ('Text Separator' and 'Image Compare') and also fails to escape outputs correctly when rendering the page..

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and executed within the user's browser when visiting the affected pages.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.

**Technical details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Widgets:** The vulnerability affects the 'Text Separator' and 'Image Compare' widgets within the 'Elementor Addon Elements' plugin.
*  **Code Changes:** The provided code diffs show that the fix involved applying `esc_attr()` and `_.escape()` functions for escaping output and user input data.
* The vulnerability is DOM based XSS, which means the XSS is triggered by modifying the webpage's document object model with user-controlled input

**Additional Notes:**
