The provided content is related to CVE-2014-125056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code used a direct string comparison (`user.password != password`) which is vulnerable to timing attacks. This is because the comparison will short-circuit if the strings are different in length or differ early in the string. An attacker can then deduce information about the password by observing how long the comparison takes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Timing Attack Vulnerability: The vulnerability exists because the initial password comparison is susceptible to timing attacks. An attacker could try different passwords and, by measuring the time taken for the authentication response, infer information about the correct password by observing differences in response times.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Password Exposure: Through timing attacks, an attacker can progressively learn the valid password, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote Timing Attacks: Attacker sends authentication requests with various incorrect passwords and measures the time taken by the server for response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the service to send authentication requests and observe the response times.
- Ability to Measure Time: The attacker must be able to measure response times accurately enough to detect timing differences.

**Mitigation:**

The commit addresses the vulnerability by implementing a constant-time string comparison. This function, `is_equal`, ensures that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the strings being compared, thus preventing timing attacks. The fix also uses `hmac.compare_digest` when available, which is the recommended approach for constant time comparisons, falling back to the custom implementation when not available.
