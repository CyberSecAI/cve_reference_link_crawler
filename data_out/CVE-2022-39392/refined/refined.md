The provided content is related to CVE-2022-39392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Wasmtime's pooling instance allocator when configured to allocate a maximum of zero memory pages to WebAssembly instances. In this specific configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not adhere to the compiler's requirements for safe execution of WebAssembly modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The pooling allocator's configuration failed to create an appropriate virtual memory mapping when `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` is set to zero.
- This allowed out-of-bounds reads and writes to access memory outside the WebAssembly sandbox.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could read or write memory that does not belong to the WebAssembly sandbox.
- This could potentially lead to information disclosure or code execution outside the sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the pooling allocator is enabled, and `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` is set to zero. This is not the default configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers would need to control the configuration of the Wasmtime runtime and enable the pooling allocator with zero memory pages.
- Attackers would need to execute a malicious WebAssembly module that attempts to perform out-of-bounds memory access.
