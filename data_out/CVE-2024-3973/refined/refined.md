- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability against high-privilege users, such as administrators, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with the payload in the `amount` parameter and tricking a user into accessing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user to click on it. No special privileges are required.
