- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `font-converter` package is vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection due to missing sanitization of input that is passed to the `child_process.exec()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary Command Injection (CWE-77). Untrusted user input is directly incorporated into a command string that is then executed by the shell.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system hosting the application using the vulnerable `font-converter` package. This can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They just need to be able to send crafted input to the application using the vulnerable package.

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how an attacker can inject commands through the package's constructor.
