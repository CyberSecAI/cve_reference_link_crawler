- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar SIEM includes vulnerable components (e.g., framework libraries) that can be identified and exploited with automated tools. Also, a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue was found.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Vulnerable components and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerable components could be exploited by automated tools. The XSS vulnerability can allow malicious scripts to be injected into the application's output.
- **Attack vectors**: Automated tools can be used to identify and exploit the vulnerable components. The XSS vulnerability requires injecting malicious scripts into the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application or inject scripts into it.
