Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-9621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Quarkus CXF extension. Passwords and other secrets may be inadvertently logged to the application log, even when configured to be hidden.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of sensitive data during logging. Specifically, even when users configure sensitive elements or headers to be hidden during logging, the Quarkus CXF extension fails to prevent their leakage to application logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Exposure of sensitive information:** An attacker who can access the application logs can view passwords and other sensitive secrets that were meant to be hidden.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who has access to the application log files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to Application Logs:** The attacker must have some form of access to the application's log files to view the leaked sensitive information.

**Conditions for vulnerability:**

The following conditions must all be met for the vulnerability to be exploitable:

1.  **SOAP message logging is enabled:** This is configured through one of the following properties:
    *   `quarkus.cxf.logging.enabled-for`
    *   `quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/endpoint-path".logging.enabled`
    *   `quarkus.cxf.client."client-name".logging.enabled`
2.  **Sensitive elements/headers configured to be hidden:** The application must set any of the following configuration properties:
    *   `quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/endpoint-path".logging.sensitive-element-names`
    *   `quarkus.cxf.endpoint."/endpoint-path".logging.sensitive-protocol-header-names`
    *   `quarkus.cxf.client."client-name".logging.sensitive-element-names`
    *   `quarkus.cxf.client."client-name".logging.sensitive-protocol-header-names`

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat Build of Apache Camel 4.4 for Quarkus 3.8 (RHBQ 3.8.6.SP2), through the RHSA-2024:10035 security advisory.
