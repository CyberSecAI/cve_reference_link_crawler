This document provides details for multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-32945, affecting MDT AutoSave software.

**CVE-2021-32945 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate encryption strength.
*   **Weakness:** The encryption used is weak, allowing an attacker to decipher it.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system over the network and have the ability to attempt decryption of the system's data. No special privileges are required.

**Summary of all Vulnerabilities:**

The document describes seven vulnerabilities in MDT AutoSave:

1.  **CVE-2021-32945: Inadequate Encryption Strength (CWE-326)**
    *   Allows attackers to decipher the encryption and gain access to the system.
2.  **CVE-2021-32953: SQL Injection (CWE-89)**
    *   Allows attackers to use SQL commands to create a new user and modify permissions, granting login access.
3.  **CVE-2021-32949: Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)**
    *   Allows attackers to change paths, traverse directories, and replace existing files with malicious ones.
4.  **CVE-2021-32933: Command Injection (CWE-77)**
    *   Allows attackers to pass a malicious file via API that manipulates process creation and allows for the execution of malicious processes.
5.  **CVE-2021-32957: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)**
    *   Allows attackers to hijack binaries due to how the system retrieves process information.
6.  **CVE-2021-32937: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information (CWE-209)**
    *   Allows attackers to learn about a session's temporary working folder and inject malicious commands.
7.  **CVE-2021-32961: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434)**
    *   Allows attackers to use a parameter in a `getfile` function to execute an unzip command and place a malicious `.exe` file in an executable location.

**General Information for all Vulnerabilities**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   MDT AutoSave versions prior to v6.02.06
    *   MDT AutoSave v7.00-7.04
    *   AutoSave for System Platform (A4SP) versions prior to 4.01
    *   A4SP Version 5.00
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to full remote execution on the Remote MDT Server without an existing user or password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Detailed understanding of product architecture and database structure
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Update MDT AutoSave and A4SP to the latest versions.
    *   Minimize network exposure of control systems.
    *   Isolate control system networks from business networks using firewalls.
    *   Use secure methods like VPNs for remote access (while also ensuring VPNs are up-to-date).
