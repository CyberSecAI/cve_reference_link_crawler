This document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-32945.

**CVE-2021-32945**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate encryption strength.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system uses weak encryption algorithms, which can be deciphered.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully deciphers the encryption could gain unauthorized access to the system.
*  **Attack vectors**:  Remote network access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system and the ability to decipher the weak encryption.

**Other Vulnerabilities mentioned in the document**

*   **CVE-2021-32953 (SQL Injection)**: An attacker could use SQL commands to create a new user with elevated permissions.
*   **CVE-2021-32949 (Relative Path Traversal)**: An attacker could manipulate file paths to replace existing files with malicious ones.
*  **CVE-2021-32933 (Command Injection)**: An attacker could use a malicious file via an API to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **CVE-2021-32957 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element)**: Vulnerability to binary hijacking by exploiting how system information is retrieved for specific processes.
*  **CVE-2021-32937 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information)**: An attacker could gain knowledge of a session's temporary working folder, facilitating the injection of malicious commands.
*   **CVE-2021-32961 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)**: An attacker could upload a malicious file that is then executed via a function that doesn't properly validate the file type.

**General Impact:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to full remote execution on the Remote MDT Server without an existing user or password.

**Affected Products:**
* MDT AutoSave versions prior to v6.02.06
* MDT AutoSave v7.00-7.04
* AutoSave for System Platform (A4SP) versions prior to 4.01
* A4SP Version 5.00

**Mitigations:**
*   Update to the latest versions of MDT AutoSave and A4SP.
*   Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
*   Locate control system networks behind firewalls.
*   Use secure methods, such as VPNs, for remote access (with awareness that VPNs also may have vulnerabilities).
