- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can potentially execute higher-privileged actions, although the specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to the affected function without proper authentication or authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
