- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `boofcv.io.calibration.CalibrationIO.load(String)` function in BoofCV loads camera calibration configurations from a file. It uses the `Yaml` class to parse the file content which is vulnerable to code injection through the use of `ScriptEngineManager` and `URLClassLoader` if the provided yaml file contains malicious instructions.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Code injection vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of YAML data. The `Yaml` class can instantiate objects specified in the YAML file, without proper sanitization which allows the execution of arbitrary code.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious YAML file to the `CalibrationIO.load` function. This could lead to complete compromise of the system running the vulnerable BoofCV library.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through providing a specially crafted YAML file to the `CalibrationIO.load(String)` function. The attacker needs to control the contents of the file that will be processed by the vulnerable function.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to control or provide the input file path to the `CalibrationIO.load` method.
