The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22914.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs within the `input()` function in `lib/lex.swf5.c` due to a double free. Specifically, a memory region allocated using `strdup` is freed, and then later accessed after being freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free
- Double free

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (though not explicitly stated, this is a potential consequence of use-after-free)

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SWF file passed to the `swfc` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a crafted SWF file that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- The attacker needs to run the `swfc` tool.
