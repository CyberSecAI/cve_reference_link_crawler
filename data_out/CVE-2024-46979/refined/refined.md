Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the `NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults` endpoint. Specifically, the code did not verify if the requesting user had the necessary permissions to access the notification filters of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses user-supplied input (the `user` parameter in the URL) to access user-specific notification filter data without proper authorization.
*   **Data Leakage:**  Due to the missing access control, an attacker can retrieve the notification filters of any user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can access sensitive notification filter information of other users. The filters contain information that, while mostly public references, could reveal some user preferences and, potentially when combined with other vulnerabilities, be used for further attacks.
*  **Limited Scope:** While a data leak is possible, the leaked information by itself is not very sensitive, reducing the impact of the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests over the network.
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a specific URL with the desired target username in the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker doesn't need to have any specific privileges or be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** An attacker needs to know the format of the vulnerable URL and the target usernames in the XWiki system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions starting from 13.2-rc-1.
*   Patches have been released in versions 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1, and 16.0-rc-1.
*   The patch involves adding a check for the user's rights before sending notification filter data.
*   A workaround is available for administrators to apply the patch manually by editing the `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults` document.
*   The vulnerability was reported on Intigriti by Mete.
*   The issue is tracked in Jira as XWIKI-20336.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.3.
*   The code changes can be viewed in the provided commit [c8c6545](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/c8c6545f9bde6f5aade994aa5b5903a67b5c2582)
