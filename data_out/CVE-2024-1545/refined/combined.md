[`8970ff4`](/wolfSSL/wolfssl/commit/8970ff4c34034dbb3594943d11f8c9d4c5512bd5)

This commit was created on GitHub.com and signed with GitHub’s **verified signature**.

GPG key ID: B5690EEEBB952194

[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

NOTE: \* --enable-heapmath is being deprecated and will be removed by end of 2024

NOTE: In future releases, --enable-des3 (which is disabled by default) will be insufficient in itself to enable DES3 in TLS cipher suites. A new option, --enable-des3-tls-suites, will need to be supplied in addition. This option should only be used in backward compatibility scenarios, as it is inherently insecure.

NOTE: This release switches the default ASN.1 parser to the new ASN template code. If the original ASN.1 code is preferred define `WOLFSSL_ASN_ORIGINAL` to use it. See PR [#7199](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7199).

## Vulnerabilities

* [High] [CVE-2024-0901](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qrv4-68mg-fv43 "CVE-2024-0901") Potential denial of service and out of bounds read. Affects TLS 1.3 on the server side when accepting a connection from a malicious TLS 1.3 client. If using TLS 1.3 on the server side it is recommended to update the version of wolfSSL used. Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7099](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7099)
* [Med] [CVE-2024-1545](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9chr-m38j-w26g "CVE-2024-1545") Fault Injection vulnerability in RsaPrivateDecryption function that potentially allows an attacker that has access to the same system with a victims process to perform a Rowhammer fault injection. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia)."

  Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7167](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7167)
* [Med] Fault injection attack with EdDSA signature operations. This affects ed25519 sign operations where the system could be susceptible to Rowhammer attacks. Thanks to Junkai Liang, Zhi Zhang, Xin Zhang, Qingni Shen for the report (Peking University, The University of Western Australia).

  Fixed in this GitHub pull request [#7212](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7212)

## New Feature Additions

* Added --enable-experimental configure flag to gate out features that are currently experimental. Now liboqs, kyber, lms, xmss, and dual-alg-certs require the --enable-experimental flag.

### POST QUANTUM SUPPORT ADDITIONS

* Experimental framework for using wolfSSL’s XMSS implementation (PR 7161)
* Experimental framework for using wolfSSL’s LMS implementation (PR 7283)
* Experimental wolfSSL Kyber implementation and assembly optimizations, enabled with --enable-experimental --enable-kyber (PR 7318)
* Experimental support for post quantum dual key/signature certificates. A few known issues and sanitizer checks are in progress with this feature. Enabled with the configure flags --enable-experimental --enable-dual-alg-certs (PR 7112)
* CryptoCb support for PQC algorithms (PR 7110)

### OTHER FEATURE ADDITIONS

* The Linux kernel module now supports registration of AES-GCM, AES-XTS, AES-CBC, and AES-CFB with the kernel cryptosystem through the new --enable-linuxkm-lkcapi-register option, enabling automatic use of wolfCrypt implementations by the dm-crypt/luks and ESP subsystems. In particular, wolfCrypt AES-XTS with –enable-aesni is faster than the native kernel implementation.
* CryptoCb hook to one-shot CMAC functions (PR 7059)
* BER content streaming support for PKCS7\_VerifySignedData and sign/encrypt operations (PR 6961 & 7184)
* IoT-Safe SHA-384 and SHA-512 support (PR 7176)
* I/O callbacks for content and output with PKCS7 bundle sign/encrypt to reduce peak memory usage (PR 7272)
* Microchip PIC24 support and example project (PR 7151)
* AutoSAR shim layer for RNG, SHA256, and AES (PR 7296)
* wolfSSL\_CertManagerUnloadIntermediateCerts API to clear intermediate certs added to certificate store (PR 7245)
* Implement SSL\_get\_peer\_signature\_nid and SSL\_get\_peer\_signature\_type\_nid (PR 7236)
