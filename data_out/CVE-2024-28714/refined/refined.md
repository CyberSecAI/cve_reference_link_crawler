Based on the content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-28713:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-28713

**Root Cause:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The Mblog Blog system v.3.5.0 is vulnerable to SSTI. This means that an attacker can inject malicious code into template files.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a full-blown root shell on the underlying operating system, giving the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves uploading a malicious theme. The template engine processes the malicious code within the uploaded theme, leading to code execution on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a theme to the target system. The specific user privileges required for this action are not specified, but typically this would involve a user with administrator-level access, or the ability to exploit an insecure file upload feature.
