Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-23218:

**Root Cause:**
- A timing side-channel issue exists within the CoreCrypto component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of constant-time computation in cryptographic functions, specifically when handling legacy RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertexts. This can lead to timing variations that an attacker can exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can decrypt legacy RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertexts without possessing the private key. This could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a timing side-channel. This means an attacker needs to be able to observe the time taken for cryptographic operations to complete in order to exploit the weakness

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to measure the execution time of cryptographic operations involving RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertexts.
- The attacker does not need the private key to perform the attack.

**Affected Products:**
- macOS Ventura
- macOS Monterey
- tvOS 17.3
- iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3
- iOS 16.7.6 and iPadOS 16.7.6
- macOS Sonoma
- watchOS 10.3
