# Missing array size check in \_Mtxinit() in the Xtensa port

High

[mrybczyn](/mrybczyn)
published
GHSA-vmp6-qhp9-r66x
Mar 26, 2024

## Package

Eclipse ThreadX

## Affected versions

< 6.4.0

## Patched versions

6.4.0

## Description

### Short Description

In Eclipse ThreadX before version 6.4.0, the \_Mtxinit() function in the Xtensa port was missing an array size check causing a memory overwrite. The affected file was ports/xtensa/xcc/src/tx\_clib\_lock.c

### Impact

There's no error handling in case `lcnt` >= `XT_NUM_CLIB_LOCKS`. The program will continue and the `tx_mutex_create()` will eventually corrupt memory by writing outside the bounds of the static `xclib_locks` array. See the marked line below:

```
#ifdef TX_THREAD_SAFE_CLIB    /* this file is only needed if using C lib */
...
#if XSHAL_CLIB == XTHAL_CLIB_XCLIB
...
static TX_MUTEX xclib_locks[XT_NUM_CLIB_LOCKS];
static uint32_t lcnt;
...
/**************************************************************************/
/*    _Mtxinit - initialize a lock. Called once for each lock.            */
/**************************************************************************/
void
_Mtxinit (_Rmtx * mtx)
{
    TX_MUTEX * lock;

    if (lcnt >= XT_NUM_CLIB_LOCKS) { // VULN: empty if() body
        /* Fatal error */
    }

    lock = &(xclib_locks[lcnt]);
    lcnt++;

    /* See notes for newlib case below. */
#ifdef THREADX_TESTSUITE
    tx_mutex_create (lock, "Clib lock", 0);
#else
    tx_mutex_create (lock, "Clib lock", TX_INHERIT);
#endif

    *mtx = lock;
}
```
### Patches

Patch available [39f3c86](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx/commit/39f3c86c61ec478720bac9fca8f17ccedb8f052b)

### Workarounds

Assure that the mutex count never reaches the limit.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
