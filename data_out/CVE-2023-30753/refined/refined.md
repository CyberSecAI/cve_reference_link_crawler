- **Website Compromise:** These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to user redirects, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning an attacker does not need to have any special privileges or login to exploit it.
- **Input Injection:** The specific mechanism for injection isn't detailed, but generally, XSS is done through user-controlled inputs that are not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the website running the vulnerable plugin.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need an account or any other form of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
