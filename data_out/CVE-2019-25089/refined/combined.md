| Since muon uses a very naive indexing implementation, it is possible to index results by simply crawling through all of them one by one.  We should use a proper filename randomization option instead. |

Fix [#4](https://github.com/Morgawr/Muon/issues/4): Use randomized URLs

```
With this commit we fix the vulnerability attack described in [#4](https://github.com/Morgawr/Muon/issues/4).
Now files are stored in their own semi-unique folder locations generated
by a list of dictionary words, randomized at runtime.

Also this commit introduces 0.2.0-indev version with initial groundwork
for automated file expiration and collection.
