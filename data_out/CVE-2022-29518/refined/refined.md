Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper check of account names within the Remote control settings of the Screen Creator Advance2 software. This is categorized as an authentication bypass issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-807:**  Improperly controlled modification of dynamically-determined values. This means that the software isn't correctly validating the access control configuration, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can access the HMI (Human Machine Interface) via the Real time remote monitoring and control tool could perform arbitrary operations.
- This could lead to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information stored in the HMI.
    - Deletion or alteration of information on the HMI.
    - Illegal operation of equipment controlled through the HMI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Real time remote monitoring and control tool", suggesting network based remote access is the attack vector.
- The attacker needs to have access to the HMI via the remote monitoring tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the HMI through the remote monitoring tool. 
- The specific access requirements are not detailed, but it is implied the attacker needs some form of network access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Screen Creator Advance2 versions prior to Ver.0.1.1.3 Build01.
- The vendor provides a workaround by disabling the remote control functionality if it is not needed, to mitigate the risk.
- The provided CVSS scores are inconsistent. CVSS v3 has a base score of 4.0, and a CVSS v2 score of 2.1. CVSS v3 indicates local access (L) while CVSS v2 indicates local access (L)
