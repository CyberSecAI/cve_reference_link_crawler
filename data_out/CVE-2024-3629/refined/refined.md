- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF check allows unauthorized modification of plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can manipulate plugin settings by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious HTML page containing a form with pre-filled settings values, that gets automatically submitted when the page is loaded. This can be delivered through various methods such as email or a compromised website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a logged-in WordPress administrator to open a malicious HTML page.
