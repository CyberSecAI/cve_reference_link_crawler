Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2112

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the "Form Maker by 10Web" plugin handles user signatures within its form submission functionality. Specifically, there's a weakness in the signature storage process that results in sensitive information exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin allows unauthorized access to user signatures.
*   **Improper Authentication:** Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to user signatures, which could contain sensitive information.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of personal data can lead to privacy breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected WordPress site.
*   **No Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or user accounts on the target system.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.15.22.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.15.23.
*   The fix involved changes to how the plugin generates filenames for signature uploads using `WDW_FM_Library::generateRandomStrOrNum` and also how it handles signature directory creation, ensuring `.htaccess` and `index.html` files are generated to prevent directory browsing.
*   Specifically, the changes in `frontend/models/form_maker.php` include:
    *   Modifying how the arithmetic captcha is verified.
    *   Using the `mixed` type for generating random strings for filenames instead of `true`.
    *   Implementing file creation with index.html and .htaccess for signature directories.
*   The change in `framework/WDW_FM_Library.php` modifies how the function `generateRandomStrOrNum` works to generate random strings.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in the Form Maker plugin allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive information (user signatures). This is due to a flaw in the plugin's signature handling process. The issue is resolved by updating to version 1.15.23, which includes changes to how filenames are generated for signature uploads and how the plugin handles signature directory creation.
