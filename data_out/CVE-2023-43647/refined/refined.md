The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found within the File upload feature of baserCMS. The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically in the file upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Potential for account compromise: By injecting malicious code, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies or perform other actions that could lead to account compromise.
- Website defacement: An attacker could potentially alter the appearance or functionality of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload: The primary attack vector is through the file upload feature, where an attacker can upload a file with a malicious file name containing JavaScript code.
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files: The attacker must be able to access the file upload functionality.
- User interaction: User interaction is required. An unsuspecting user must view a page containing an uploaded file that has a malicious name.
