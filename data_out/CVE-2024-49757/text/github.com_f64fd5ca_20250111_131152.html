# User Registration Bypass

High

[livio-a](/livio-a)
published
GHSA-3rmw-76m6-4gjc
Oct 25, 2024

## Package

ZITADEL
(ZITADEL)

## Affected versions

<2.58.6, <2.59.4, <2.60.3, <2.61.3, <2.62.6, < 2.63.4,

## Patched versions

2.64.0, 2.63.5, 2.62.7, 2.61.4, 2.60.4, 2.59.5, 2.58.7

## Description

### Impact

Zitadel allows administrators to disable the user self-registration. Due to a missing security check in versions prior to 2.63.4, disabling the "User Registration allowed" option only hid the registration button on the login page. Users could bypass this restriction by directly accessing the registration URL (/ui/login/loginname) and register a user that way.

### Patches

2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.64.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.64.0)

2.63.x versions are fixed on >= [2.63.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.63.5)

2.62.x versions are fixed on >= [2.62.7](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.62.7)

2.61.x versions are fixed on >= [2.61.4](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.61.4)

2.60.x versions are fixed on >= [2.60.4](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.60.4)

2.59.x versions are fixed on >= [2.59.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.59.5)

2.58.x versions are fixed on >= [2.58.7](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.58.7)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
