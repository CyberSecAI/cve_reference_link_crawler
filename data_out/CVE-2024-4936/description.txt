The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8 via the abspath parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. This required allow_url_include to be enabled on the target site in order to exploit.
