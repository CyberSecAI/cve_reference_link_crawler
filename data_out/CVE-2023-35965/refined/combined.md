# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1787

## Yifan YF325 httpd manage\_post stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities

##### October 11, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-35965,CVE-2023-35966

##### SUMMARY

Two heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the httpd manage\_post functionality of Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108. A specially crafted network request can lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can send a network request to trigger these vulnerabilities.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108

##### PRODUCT URLS

YF325 - <https://yifanwireless.com/entry-level-wifi-router/yf325-series-gprs/3g/4g-wifi-router-with-sim-card-slot.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-190 - Integer Overflow or Wraparound

##### DETAILS

The Yifan YF325 is an industrial cellular router. This device is designed for M2M and IOT applications, allowing remote management, offering several VPN services and many other features.

The YF325 router provides a series of APIs. Many of those APIs, which expect to receive a POST request, use the `manage_post` function to manage the received POST data:

```
void manage_post(undefined4 param_1,FILE **fd,int content_length)

{
  [...]
  if (post == 1) {
    if (POST_DATA == (char *)0x0) {
      POST_DATA = (char *)malloc(content_length + 1U);                                                          [1]
    }
    else {
      POST_DATA = (char *)realloc(POST_DATA,content_length + 1U);                                               [2]
    }
    if ((POST_DATA != (char *)0x0) &&
       (data_end = wfread(POST_DATA,1,content_length,fd), [...])) {                                             [3]
      [...]
    }
  }
  [...]
}

```

The first thing checked, after confirming that the request is actually a POST, is if the `POST_DATA` global variable has already been initialized. Based on the answer, a `malloc` or a `realloc` is called to accommodate the actual request’s `Content-Length`.

The `Content-Length` is parsed in the `manage_request` function:

```
void manage_request(void)
{
  [... receive and parse the request until the start of the headers ...]
  [... peforms some checks and parse on the received data ... ]

  while( true ) {
    [... tmp_buff is a buffer just after current_header buffer ...]
    read_len = wfgets(current_header,(int)tmp_buff - (int)current_header,(char *)CLIENT_REQUEST_FD);
    if (((is_equal == 0) || (is_equal = strcmp(current_header,"\n"), is_equal == 0)) ||
        (is_equal = strcmp(current_header,"\r\n"), is_equal == 0)) break;
    is_equal = strncasecmp(current_header,"Authorization:",0xe);
    if (is_equal == 0) {
      [...]
    }
    else {
      is_equal = strncasecmp(current_header,"Referer:",8);
      if (is_equal == 0) {
        [...]
      }
      else {
        is_equal = strncasecmp(current_header,"Host:",5);
        if (is_equal == 0) {
          [...]
        }
        else {
          is_equal = strncasecmp(current_header,"Content-Length:",0xf);                                         [4]
          if (is_equal == 0) {
            content_length_value_ptr = current_header + 0xf;
            [...]
            content_length_empty_space = strspn(content_length_value_ptr," \t");
            content_length = content_length_value_ptr + content_length_empty_space;
            CONTENT_LENGTH = strtoul(content_length,(char **)0x0,0);
    [...]
  while( true ) {                                                                                               [5]
    URL_path_pattern = (code *)API_entry_cursor->URL_path_pattern;
    [... find the correct API entry based on the URL path pattern ...]
  }
  [...]
  post = 0;
  is_equal = strcasecmp(request_method,"post");
  if (is_equal == 0) {
    post = 1;
  }
  if ((code *)API_entry_cursor->manage_request_data != (code *)0x0) {
    (*(code *)API_entry_cursor->manage_request_data)
              (request_URL+1,CLIENT_REQUEST_FD,CONTENT_LENGTH,boundary);                                        [6]
  }
  [...]
}

```

The function will eventually parse, at `[4]`, the `Content-Length`. Then, at `[5]`, based on the URL path, the correct API entry struct to use is located. At `[6]`, the `manage_request_data` function of the located API entry, if not null, is called. The `manage_request_data` struct field, for several APIs, corresponds to the `manage_post` function.

#### CVE-2023-35965 - malloc integer overflow

Many API URL paths will eventually call the `manage_post` function. At `[1]` for the `malloc` function the requested size is `content_length + 1`. The `+ 1` is used to ensure there is enough space for the null terminator. Because the `content_length` value is never checked, it could correspond to the max unsigned integer, so, an integer overflow vulnerability exists at `[1]` that can lead to a heap buffer overflow at `[3]`.

#### CVE-2023-35966 - realloc integer overflow

Many API URL paths will eventually call the `manage_post` function. At `[2]` for the `realloc` function the requested size is `content_length + 1`. The `+ 1` is used to ensure there is enough space for the null terminator. Because the `content_length` value is never checked, it could correspond to the max unsigned integer, so, an integer overflow vulnerability exists at `[2]` that can lead to a heap buffer overflow at `[3]`.
