The provided content is related to CVE-2023-35965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `manage_post` function of the Yifan YF325 router's httpd service when handling POST requests. Specifically, the `Content-Length` header is read from the request and used to allocate memory using `malloc` or `realloc`. If `Content-Length` is a large value, close to the maximum value of an unsigned integer, adding 1 can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a small memory allocation. Subsequent read operation into this buffer leads to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow when calculating the buffer size in `malloc` and `realloc` operations.
- Heap-based buffer overflow when reading data into the undersized buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by sending a POST request with a crafted `Content-Length` header. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious impacts on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can send a network request to the vulnerable API endpoint with a specially crafted `Content-Length` header to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router and the ability to send HTTP POST requests. No authentication is needed.
