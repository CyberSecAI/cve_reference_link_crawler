# Vulnerability Report - com.creative.apps.xficonnect- Incorrect Access Control

**Product:** `com.creative.apps.xficonnect`

**Vendor:** [Creative Labs Pte Ltd](https://hk.creative.com/)

**Version:** 2.00.02

**Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control

**Severity:** High

## Description

The `com.creative.apps.xficonnect` , developed by **Creative Labs Pte Ltd**, suffers from an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability during the device firmware update process. The app uses HTTPS requests to download firmware updates. By reverse engineering the app, it was possible to identify the firmware download mechanism and the download link. Dynamic testing revealed that the vendor's firmware server lacks proper access control, leading to **firmware leakage**.

## Reproduction Steps

1. The `IM_SERVER_PATH, IM_SERVER_PATH_STAGE` Field values in the `ApplicationUpdateConstant` class provide the necessary URL and other information required for the HTTPS request. Static reverse engineering allows for the reconstruction of the complete request as follows:

   [![image-20241003200421588](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/96b6ba7ee6aa755f4fbfd814d4538f69fbd0490b56fec66838eb701c0c9f39b5/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30332f33467454614852576f50387a4275492e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/96b6ba7ee6aa755f4fbfd814d4538f69fbd0490b56fec66838eb701c0c9f39b5/68747470733a2f2f73322e6c6f6c692e6e65742f323032342f31302f30332f33467454614852576f50387a4275492e706e67)
2. Sending this URL request to the firmware server results in a direct response containing the latest firmware information as follows:

   > Request

   ```
   GET https://api.creative.com/soniccarrier/creative/firmwareupgrade/creative_sxfi_theater.json HTTP/2
   Content-Type: text/plain
   host: api.creative.com

   }
   ```

   Consequently, the unprotected firmware can be directly downloaded using this information.
