# GoCD before 19.11.0 has API authentication of user access tokens subject to timing attack during comparison

Moderate

[chadlwilson](/chadlwilson)
published
GHSA-999p-fp84-jcpq
Oct 14, 2022

## Package

 gocd-server

## Affected versions

>= 19.2.0, < 19.11.0

## Patched versions

19.11.0

## Description

### Impact

GoCD versions from 19.2.0 to 19.10.0 (inclusive) are subject to a timing attack in validation of access tokens due to use of regular string comparison for validation of the token rather than a constant time algorithm. This could allow a brute force attack on GoCD server API calls to observe timing differences in validations in order to guess an access token generated by a user for API access.

### Patches

Fixed in GoCD 19.11.0.

### Workarounds

* Apply rate limiting or insert random delays to API calls made to GoCD Server via a reverse proxy or other fronting web server.
* Disallow use of access tokens by users by having an administrator revoke all access tokens through the "Access Token Management" admin function.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
