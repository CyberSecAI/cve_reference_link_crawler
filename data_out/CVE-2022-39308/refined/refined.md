{
  "CVE-2022-39308": {
    "description": "GoCD versions from 19.2.0 to 19.10.0 (inclusive) are subject to a timing attack in validation of access tokens due to use of regular string comparison for validation of the token rather than a constant time algorithm. This could allow a brute force attack on GoCD server API calls to observe timing differences in validations in order to guess an access token generated by a user for API access.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of a regular string comparison instead of a constant-time algorithm when validating access tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing attack",
      "Use of regular string comparison instead of constant-time algorithm"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful timing attack could allow an attacker to guess a user's access token by observing timing differences during token validation, potentially leading to unauthorized API access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, targeting the GoCD server API.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make API calls to the GoCD server and measure the response times. No specific user privileges are required."
