Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-26656**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free in the AMDGPU DRM driver. This occurs when an invalid address and size are provided to the `amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl` function.  Specifically, an error during `mmu_interval_notifier_insert` is followed by a call to `amdgpu_hmm_unregister`, which eventually leads to `amdgpu_gem_object_free` attempting to access freed memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The core weakness is the use-after-free, which stems from not properly handling the error condition within `amdgpu_hmm_register`.
- Inadequate error handling: The driver does not correctly prevent unregistering a notifier when its insertion failed, leading to the use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash due to the access of invalid memory, as demonstrated by the provided stack trace.
- Depending on the context, this could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user can trigger the bug by sending a specific ioctl, `amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl` with an invalid address and size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to call the `drmIoctl` system call and be able to interact with the AMDGPU DRM driver.
- The attacker needs to be able to specify an invalid memory address and size.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves setting `bo->notifier.mm = NULL;` when `mmu_interval_notifier_insert` fails. This prevents `amdgpu_hmm_unregister` from calling `mmu_interval_notifier_remove` on an improperly initialized notifier.
- The issue was reported by Joonkyo Jung from Yonsei University.
- The provided code snippet `Syzkaller1` shows a way to trigger the bug by providing a large and invalid address/size.
- The stack trace provided demonstrates a crash inside the `mmu_interval_notifier_remove` function, confirming the use-after-free.
