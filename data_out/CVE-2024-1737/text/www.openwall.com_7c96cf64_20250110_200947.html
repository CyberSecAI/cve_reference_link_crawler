Subject: Re: ISC has disclosed four vulnerabilities in BIND 9
 (CVE-2024-0760, CVE-2024-1737, CVE-2024-1975, CVE-2024-4076)

Note to anyone running 9.18 series (which means at least all Debian 12
installations) that the "fix" for this CVE in that branch is the complete
removal of SIG(0) dynamic DNS update support. Not just a disabled-by-default
config option, but the actual removal of the relevant code.

The actual mitigation for the issue is only available in the 9.20 series.

IMO this seems like a rather drastic way of doing things for a 0.0.1 patch
release to a purportedly stable branch. Anyway reverting
<https://github.com/isc-projects/bind9/commit/bef3d2cca3552100bbe44790c8c1a4f5bef06798>
restores SIG(0) support (along with the vulnerability) for those who prefer to
live dangerously.
