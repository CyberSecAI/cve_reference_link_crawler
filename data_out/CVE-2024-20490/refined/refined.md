{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "HTTP proxy credentials could be recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure vulnerability due to logging sensitive information (HTTP proxy credentials) in tech support files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with access to a tech support file could view HTTP proxy server admin credentials in clear text. This could allow them to compromise external network access.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to access a tech support file generated from an affected system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to gain access to a tech support file generated from an affected Cisco NDFC or Cisco NDO system. This could be achieved by compromising an internal user who has access to the tech support file or gaining unauthorized access to the system where it's stored."
