For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndhs-idv-Bk8VqEDc>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco NDFC, Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights, and Cisco NDO, regardless of device configuration.  **Note:** Starting with Cisco Nexus Dashboard Release 3.1(1k), Cisco NDFC, Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights, and Cisco NDO are distributed in Cisco Nexus Dashboard unified releases.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug IDs at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20490: Cisco NDFC and Cisco NDO Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) and Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information.  This vulnerability exists because HTTP proxy credentials could be recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view HTTP proxy server *admin* credentials in clear text that are configured on Nexus Dashboard to reach an external network.  **Note:** Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug IDs: [CSCwk96526](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk96526), [CSCwm28892](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwm28892)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20490Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.3CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N  **CVE-2024-20491: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights Information Disclosure Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information.  This vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller *admin* credentials in clear text.  **Note:** Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
