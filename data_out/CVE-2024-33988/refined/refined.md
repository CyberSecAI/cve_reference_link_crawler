The provided content is related to CVE-2024-33988.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The affected systems are vulnerable because they do not properly sanitize user input when processing the parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could create a specially crafted URL and send it to a victim. If the victim clicks the link, the attacker can obtain details of their session cookie. This could lead to session hijacking and potentially unauthorized access to the victim's account and associated sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL. The attacker would need to entice a victim to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need any special position or capabilities other than the ability to craft a URL and send it to the victim. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, which requires the victim to click the malicious link.
