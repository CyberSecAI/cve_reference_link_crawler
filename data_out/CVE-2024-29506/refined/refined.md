Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29506:

**CVE-2024-29506: Stack buffer overflow in `pdfi_apply_filter()`**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `pdfi_apply_filter` function within the Ghostscript PDF interpreter.
*   **Weakness:** The code copies the PDF filter name into a fixed-size stack buffer (`str[100]`) without proper bounds checking. The size of the filter name (`n->length`) is controlled by the attacker, which causes a buffer overflow if the filter name is larger than 100 bytes.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unchecked `memcpy` into a stack buffer.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow which could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file that contains a filter name larger than 100 bytes in length. The `-dPDFDEBUG` flag must also be enabled to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PDF file to Ghostscript and control the command line arguments to enable the `-dPDFDEBUG` flag.

**Summary of relevant details:**
* The vulnerability is located in `pdfi_apply_filter` within the Ghostscript PDF interpreter.
* It is triggered when the `-dPDFDEBUG` flag is enabled.
* A `memcpy` copies an attacker-controlled filter name into a 100-byte stack buffer without any size checks.
* The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted PDF file.
* This vulnerability was fixed in Ghostscript version 10.03.0.
