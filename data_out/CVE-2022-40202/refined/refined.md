The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master, including CVE-2022-40202.

**Root cause of vulnerability (CVE-2022-40202):**
- The database backup function lacks proper authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (CVE-2022-40202):**
- Missing authentication for a critical function (database backup).
- Deserialization of untrusted data: Attackers can provide malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of exploitation (CVE-2022-40202):**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code by leveraging the backup scheduling function without authentication. The attacker can designate all function arguments and the file to be executed.

**Attack vectors (CVE-2022-40202):**
- Network: Exploitation can occur remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position (CVE-2022-40202):**
- Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable service.
- Ability to send malicious serialized objects.
