The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master, including CVE-2022-40202.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to **CVE-2022-40202**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Missing authentication for the database backup function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The database backup function lacks proper authentication.
*   The software deserializes untrusted data, specifically when malicious serialized objects are provided.
*   The backup scheduling function can be activated without authentication.
*   The function allows the attacker to designate all function arguments and the file to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network: An attacker can send malicious serialized objects through the network.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted network packets to the vulnerable service.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-40202 is a critical vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve remote code execution by exploiting the lack of authentication in the database backup function of Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master. The vulnerability is triggered when the software deserializes a malicious object which, when processed, causes the execution of an attacker-specified file. This vulnerability exists in versions 00.00.01a and prior. The advisory indicates it is fixed in version 1.0.3.
