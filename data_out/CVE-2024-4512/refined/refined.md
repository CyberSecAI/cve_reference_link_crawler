Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before it is echoed directly into HTML on the `/Employee/edit-profile.php` and `/Employee/profile.php` pages. Specifically, the parameters `txtfullname`, `txtdob`, `txtaddress`, `txtqualification`, `cmddept`, `cmdemployeetype`, and `txtappointment` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks because it directly embeds user-supplied data into the HTML response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the affected pages.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to `/Employee/edit-profile.php` by modifying the vulnerable parameters.
- The injected payload is reflected back in the response on `/Employee/edit-profile.php` when editing the profile, and on `/Employee/profile.php` when viewing the profile.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- They need to be able to manipulate the vulnerable parameters in the POST request.
- For successful exploitation, the victim user has to visit the affected page, triggering the XSS payload. In this case, the user must be logged into the application

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable parameters are directly echoed into HTML input fields and other parts of the page without proper sanitization or output encoding.
- The provided PoC demonstrates successful execution of JavaScript alert boxes using the payload `<svg/onload=alert``>`.
- The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the Prison Management System.
- The application is running on PHP, Apache, and MySQL.
- The application uses a cookie named PHPSESSID which could be targeted by the attack
