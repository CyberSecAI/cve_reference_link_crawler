| Once the TLS handshake completes, QUICConn.HandleData buffers data and passes it to `handlePostHandshakeMessage` every time the buffer contains a complete message. The size check is wrong, however, so it can pass along a partial message, triggering a panic when `handlePostHandshakeMessage` tries to read the remainder of the message.  In addition, `HandleData` doesn't limit the amount of data it can buffer. It should reject messages larger than `maxHandshake`.  Thanks to [@marten-seemann](https://github.com/marten-seemann) for reporting this issue.  Normally, we'd consider this a PRIVATE track vulnerability, but this is a very new API and the only known user (quic-go) has already released a workaround in a patch release, so we're calling it PUBLIC track.  The panic due to partial messages is [CVE-2023-39321](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9v7r-x7cv-v437 "CVE-2023-39321"). The lack of a limit on buffered post-handshake data is [CVE-2023-39322](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-892h-r6cr-53g4 "CVE-2023-39322"). |

`[[release-branch.go1.21] crypto/tls: QUIC: fix panics when processing …](/golang/go/commit/91a4e74b98179f63a27dbff1ad68ddd0ed64363a "[release-branch.go1.21] crypto/tls: QUIC: fix panics when processing post-handshake messages

The check for fragmentary post-handshake messages in QUICConn.HandleData
was reversed, resulting in a potential panic when HandleData receives
a partial message.

In addition, HandleData wasn't checking the size of buffered
post-handshake messages. Produce an error when a post-handshake
message is larger than maxHandshake.

TestQUICConnectionState was using an onHandleCryptoData hook
in runTestQUICConnection that was never being called.
(I think it was inadvertently removed at some point while
the CL was in review.) Fix this test while making the hook
more general.

Fixes #62290
