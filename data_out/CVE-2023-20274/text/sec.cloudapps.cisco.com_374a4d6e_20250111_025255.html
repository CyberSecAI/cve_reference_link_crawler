This vulnerability is due to insufficient permissions that are set by the PHP Agent Installer on the PHP Agent install directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying objects in the PHP Agent install directory, which would run with the same privileges as PHP. A successful exploit could allow a lower-privileged attacker to elevate their privileges to *root* on an affected device.  Cisco AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
