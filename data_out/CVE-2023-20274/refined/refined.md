- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient permissions set by the PHP Agent Installer on the PHP Agent install directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer script sets insufficient permissions on the PHP Agent install directory, allowing modification of objects within the directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, authenticated attacker could modify objects in the PHP Agent install directory, which would then run with the same privileges as PHP. This could lead to privilege escalation to root.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with high privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the affected system with at least some privileges.
