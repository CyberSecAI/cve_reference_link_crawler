Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from issues within the symbol parsing logic of radare2, specifically in how it handles symbol information in Mach-O files and a related out-of-bounds read issue. There were two specific issues:

1.  **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The `r_coresym_cache_element_new` function in `libr/bin/format/mach0/coresymbolication.c` had an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing the string table. If the `file_name_off` offset was close to or beyond the end of the buffer, the `str_dup_safe` function could read out of bounds.
2.  **Null Dereference:** The `symbols` function in `libr/bin/p/bin_symbols.c` contained a null pointer dereference vulnerability. If the code encounters a null symbol, the code would try to dereference the symbol which is a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** Accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Null pointer dereference:** Attempting to access a memory location through a null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact of both vulnerabilities is a crash of the radare2 program. The out-of-bounds read can lead to unpredictable behavior and a crash. The null pointer dereference will also cause the program to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Mach-O File:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by parsing specially crafted Mach-O files that have a malformed symbol table, specifically by manipulating the offset to file names or by creating null symbols within the symbol tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted Mach-O file to radare2. This could happen if the user opens a malicious file or processes a file from a potentially untrusted source.
