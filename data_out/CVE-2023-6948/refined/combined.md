# Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input

CVE-2023-6948

Subscribe to Labs
## Summary

A Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input issue affecting the v2\_sdk\_service running on a set of DJI drone devices on the port 10000 could allow an attacker to cause a crash of the service through a crafted payload triggering a missing input size check in the sdk\_printf function implemented in the libv2\_sdk.so library used by the dji\_vtwo\_sdk binary implementing the service, compromising it in a term of availability and producing a denial-of-service attack.

### Impact

An adjacent attacker may perform a denial-of-service attack on the v2\_sdk\_service running on the drone.

### Issue Date

March 29, 2024

### Affects

This issue affects: Mavic 3 Pro below version 01.01.0300, Mavic 3 below version 01.00.1200, Mavic 3 Classic below version 01.00.0500, Mavic 3 Enterprise below version 7.01.10.03, Matrice 300 below version 57.00.01.00, Matrice M30 below version 07.01.0022, Mini 3 Pro below version 01.00.0620

## Research Projects

### TRITON

TRITON is the first known cyberattack that directly interacted with a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). Labs reverse engineered the TriStation suite of software and delivered a report and two free tools for security researchers. This research was presented at Black Hat USA 2018.

### GreyEnergy

The Labs team reverse engineered the GreyEnergy malicious document (maldoc) that leads to the installation of the malware (backdoor) on a victimâs network. Project outcomes include a report, multiple blogs and two free tools for security researchers.

### IEC 62351

IEC Working Group 15 (WG15) is developing technology standards for secure-by-design power systems. Labs contributes to the standards and has demonstrated how they can be used to identify hard-to-detect cyberattacks. Research from this effort was presented at Black Hat USA 2019.
