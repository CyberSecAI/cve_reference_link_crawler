**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This is caused by an overhead on the server, potentially due to excessive resource consumption or similar.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over HTTP/2. Specifically, the vulnerability relates to how the server handles the flow of data when a client communicates using HTTP/2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable server.
-  No specific user interaction is needed, and no special privileges are required (as suggested by CVSS vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue by Red Hat.
-  The NetApp advisory indicates a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating high availability impact.
-  Several Red Hat products are affected by the vulnerability.
- Patches have been released for affected Red Hat products, such as Red Hat Fuse, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes.
- Patches have also been released by NetApp for affected products, such as OnCommand Insight and OnCommand Workflow Automation.
