- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper use of a randomness function with low entropy for web authentication token generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient entropy in the generation of web authentication tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A LAN-based attacker could potentially guess a valid session token if multiple authenticated sessions are active. This could lead to unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is LAN-based, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable switch.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network (LAN) as the affected Zyxel switch and needs to monitor/guess valid session tokens.
