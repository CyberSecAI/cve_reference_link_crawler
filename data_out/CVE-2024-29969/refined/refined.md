- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When upgrading Brocade SANnav from v2.2.2 to v2.3.0, weak TLS/SSL message authentication code ciphers are added by default for port 18082.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the inclusion of weak TLS/SSL message authentication code ciphers in the default configuration of Brocade SANnav after the upgrade, specifically for port 18082.  The identified weak ciphers are:
    - AES256+EECDH
    - AES256+EDH
    - TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA
    - TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA
    - TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA
    - TLS\_ECDHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA
- **Impact of exploitation:** The presence of these weak ciphers could potentially allow an attacker to eavesdrop on or manipulate TLS/SSL encrypted communications on port 18082. The impact is described as HIGH with a CVSS score of 7.5, but with Confidentiality impact High, and Integrity and Availability impact None, meaning the confidentiality of the information transmitted over TLS/SSL is primarily at risk.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker would need to intercept and potentially manipulate the network communication on port 18082, which is likely used for management traffic in the SANnav product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic to exploit this vulnerability. They would not require any prior authentication or specific user interaction.
