| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2256690#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-01-03 22:10:39 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds memory access may occur when a device frozen by a sync grab is reattached to a different master device. The number of buttons is incorrectly calculated to be zero and this can be exploited for LPE if the server runs with extended privileges or RCE for ssh x11 forwarding.  This was reported as ZDI-CAN-22678 to the xorg-security list.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2256690#c4)  Sandipan Roy    2024-01-18 04:16:48 UTC  ``` Created tigervnc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2258929](show_bug.cgi?id=2258929 "CLOSED ERRATA -
