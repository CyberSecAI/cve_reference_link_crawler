Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file handling module of moziloCMS v2.0, specifically related to file uploads and renaming.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent File Extension Checks:** The application performs checks on file extensions during the upload process, disallowing file types configured in the admin panel. However, these checks are not consistently applied when files are renamed after being uploaded.
*   **Bypassable Extension Restrictions:** An attacker can bypass the initial extension restrictions by uploading a file with an allowed extension and then renaming the file to one that should be blocked (e.g., from .txt to .php).
*   **Inadequate File Type Verification:** The system checks file extensions, but not the file type itself, creating a blind spot that attackers can exploit by renaming files after they are uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Execution:** By uploading and renaming malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Storage of Malicious Content:** The attacker could also use this vulnerability to store malicious content on the server, which could be used to serve malware, deface the website or for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** Initially, the attacker uploads a file with an allowed extension to the server through the designated upload mechanism.
*   **File Renaming:** The attacker then uses the application's file renaming functionality to change the uploaded file's extension to a disallowed type, effectively bypassing the initial security check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account with the capability to upload and rename files within the moziloCMS application.

**Technical Details:**

* The code snippets included in the content shows the file upload and file rename functions.
*   The application uses the `substr` function with `strrpos` to extract the file extension for validation during upload, and this process is missing in the rename functionality which allows to bypass the extension check.
*   The `moveFileDir` function is used for renaming the files, but it lacks proper validation of the new file extension.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to upload and rename files to bypass the extension restrictions, and potentially leading to unauthorized code execution or storage of malicious content on the server.
