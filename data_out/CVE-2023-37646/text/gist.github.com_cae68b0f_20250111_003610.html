| Vulnerability type | Product name | Affected version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remote Code Execution | [Bitberry File Opener](https://www.bitberry.com/file-opener/index.html) | 23.0 |

Bitberry File Opener 23.0 has a directory traversal when it concatenates a file path embedded in the CAB file to a current directory. Making a user open a crafted file, an attacker can write arbitrary files into the startup folder, which ends up with remote code execution.
