- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the affected applications when parsing a specially crafted CGM file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. The application could crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious CGM file with the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file. The attacker does not require any special privileges.
