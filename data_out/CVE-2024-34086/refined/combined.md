SSA-661579: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go

| Publication Date: | 2024-05-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-05-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Teamcenter Visualization and JT2Go are affected by multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads malicious CGM or XML files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
