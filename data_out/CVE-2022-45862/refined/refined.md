Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an "insufficient session expiration vulnerability" related to GUI console WebSockets. Specifically, the WebSocket sessions are not terminated properly upon logout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-613:** Insufficient Session Expiration
*   The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly invalidate or terminate WebSocket sessions when a user logs out of the GUI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers who obtain valid credentials can potentially re-use existing web sessions even after a user has logged out. This could enable attackers to perform unauthorized actions if they intercept or obtain access to a session token.
*   The impact is classified as "Improper access control."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker needs to acquire valid login credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to obtain the credentials of a valid user who has logged into the GUI.
*   The attacker must be in a position to intercept or re-use the user's web session after they've logged out from the GUI.
*   Exploitation is possible with high attack complexity(AC:H)
