- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to validate a parameter, allowing a malicious user to inject an HTTP-EQUIV tag for a refresh redirect.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP-EQUIV injection, Open Redirect. The plugin does not properly sanitize the input in the "Business Name" field, leading to the injection of a malicious HTTP-EQUIV meta tag.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website by injecting a crafted payload into the "Business Name" field of a post. This could lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to create or edit a post and inject a malicious payload using the "Business Name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with "contributor" or higher privileges.
