- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in the AIX `invscout` command that allows arbitrary command execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `invscout` command allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A non-privileged local user can execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data breaches, or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A local, non-privileged user can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A non-privileged user with local access to an affected AIX or VIOS system is required.
