## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Spiffy Calendar < 4.9.9 - Broken Access Control

### Description

The plugin doesn't check the event\_author parameter, and allows any user to alter it when creating an event, leading to deceiving users/admins that a page was created by a Contributor+.

### Proof of Concept

Using a Contributor+ account and a proxy interceptor such as Burp Suite, create an event.
Change the event\_location parameter name in the request to event\_author, and feed it an ID of an admin (example ID 1).
Submit the request, and the event will be created, reflecting that it was created by X admin (the username of the ID used in step 2).
