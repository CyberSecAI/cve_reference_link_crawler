Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `sno` parameter in the `edit1.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without adequate sanitization or using parameterized queries, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete existing data in the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers could gain control over the entire system by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Service Disruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt service by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the `edit1.php` endpoint.
*   **`sno` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `sno`, which is included in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided information indicates that no login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make HTTP requests and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
*   **Knowledge of target parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the `sno` parameter as the vulnerable entry point.

**Technical Details and Proof of Concept:**
*   The provided content includes a sample POST request demonstrating the vulnerability:
    ```
    POST /edit1.php HTTP/1.1

    sno=111
    ```
*   It details several types of SQL injection payloads that can be used:
    *   **Boolean-based blind:** `sno=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (5097=5097) THEN 111 ELSE (SELECT 5448 UNION SELECT 4985) END))`
    *   **Error-based:** `sno=111 OR (SELECT 5629 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7178787071,(SELECT (ELT(5629=5629,1))),0x716a6b7871,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)`
    *  **Time-based blind:** `sno=111 AND (SELECT 8612 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))lMAr)`

**Suggested Repairs:**

*   **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameter binding to separate SQL code from user data, preventing injection.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure user input matches the expected format and is safe.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Minimize database user permissions to reduce the impact of potential unauthorized access.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code and system audits to proactively identify and resolve potential security vulnerabilities.
