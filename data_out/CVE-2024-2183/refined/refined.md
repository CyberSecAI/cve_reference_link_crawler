Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Beaver Builder Addons by WPZOOM" WordPress plugin, specifically in the Heading widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the Heading widget, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user visits a page containing the injected malicious script within the heading widget, the script executes in their browser. This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Heading Widget:** The primary attack vector is the Heading widget provided by the plugin. An attacker can insert the malicious JavaScript code through the heading or description fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they need to have an account on the site and the ability to edit content.
*   **Plugin installed:** The "Beaver Builder Addons by WPZOOM" plugin must be installed and active on the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.3.4.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.3.5 by implementing proper sanitization and output escaping using functions like `esc_url`, `esc_attr`, and `wp_kses_post`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francesco Carlucci.
*   CVE-2024-30424 is suspected to be a duplicate of this issue.

**Summary of Changes (from the provided diff):**

The provided changeset shows the following main changes:

*   **Input Sanitization:**  Unsafe input from the plugin's settings is now being sanitized using functions like `esc_url()` for URLs, `esc_attr()` for HTML attributes, and `wp_kses_post()` for post content in various modules such as `wpzabb-button`, `wpzabb-clients`, `wpzabb-heading`, `wpzabb-image-box`, `wpzabb-team-members`, and `wpzabb-testimonials`.
*   **Version Update:** The plugin's version has been updated to 1.3.5 in `readme.txt` and `wpzoom-bb-addon-pack.php`.
*   **Bug Fix:** A bug related to featured posts in the slideshow module has been fixed.
