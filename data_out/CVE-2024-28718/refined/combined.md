# time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack

### Bug Description

At <https://github.com/openstack/magnum/blob/537e69aeb8df7af480e6af11a98687179d4dd89c/magnum/conductor/handlers/common/cert_manager.py#L185>

, we first write ca\_file,key\_file cert\_file , then we chmod mode them.

```

 ca\_file = open(cached\_ca\_file, "w+")

            ca\_file.write(encodeutils.safe\_decode(ca\_cert.get\_certificate()))

            ca\_file.flush()

     key\_file = open(cached\_key\_file, "w+")

            key\_file.write(encodeutils.safe\_decode(

                magnum\_cert.get\_decrypted\_private\_key()))

            key\_file.flush()

     cert\_file = open(cached\_cert\_file, "w+")

            cert\_file.write(

                encodeutils.safe\_decode(magnum\_cert.get\_certificate()))

            cert\_file.flush()

     os.chmod(cached\_ca\_file, 0o600)

            os.chmod(cached\_key\_file, 0o600)

            os.chmod(cached\_cert\_file, 0o600)

```

When a file is first written and then its permissions are later changed using chmod, there exists a potential security risk known as a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack. In this type of attack, an attacker exploits the time window between when the file is initially written and when its permissions are modified. During this time window, the attacker may gain access to the file.
