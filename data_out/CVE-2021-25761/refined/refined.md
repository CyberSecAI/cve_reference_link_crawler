The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-25761.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A birthday attack was possible on the SessionStorage key in the Ktor framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the `SessionStorage` key was generated, making it susceptible to a birthday attack. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict or forge session keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user sessions, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating or predicting the session keys, likely involving a large number of requests/attempts to exploit the birthday paradox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Ktor application and have a means to generate and test session keys. This is likely a network-based attack.
