Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2021-47522.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference can occur in the `bigben_worker` function within the `hid-bigbenff.c` driver. This happens when the device is emulated through `uhid` and the device does not have output reports, resulting in `report_field` being null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The code accesses `report_field` without checking if it is null, which can cause a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the bigbenff HID device is emulated using uhid and no output reports are configured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to emulate a bigbenff HID device through `uhid` and configure it in a way that does not include output reports. This would most likely require a user with access to the host machine.
