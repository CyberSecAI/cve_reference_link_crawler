The provided content relates to CVE-2024-0963.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'location' attribute within the plugin's `CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS` shortcode. Specifically, the plugin was converting shortcode attributes into JavaScript variables with global scope, allowing attackers to overwrite global variables like `window` or `document`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute when a user accesses the injected page. This could allow for a wide range of malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- By using the `CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS` shortcode with a crafted `location` attribute, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level permissions to create or modify content where the shortcode can be inserted.
