- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Content Security Policy (CSP) that disables `eval` is not consistently applied to renderers with `sandbox` and `contextIsolation` disabled in Electron. Specifically, when `sandbox: false` and `contextIsolation: false` are set in the `webPreferences` object, methods like `eval()` and `new Function()` are incorrectly allowed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect enforcement of Content Security Policy (CSP). Specifically, the `script-src` directive not properly preventing use of `eval` and `new Function` in renderers with specific configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Allows the use of `eval()` and `new Function()` in the renderer process despite CSP preventing it, potentially leading to a larger attack surface. This could allow for arbitrary code execution within the renderer process, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Network (as indicated by CVSS base metrics). The vulnerability is in the renderer process of an application which can be accessed through remote content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control content loaded in an Electron renderer that has sandbox and context isolation disabled. They need low privileges. No user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.
