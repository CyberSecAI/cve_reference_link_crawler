# Content-Secrity-Policy disabling eval not applied consistently in renderers with sandbox disabled

High

[MarshallOfSound](/MarshallOfSound)
published
GHSA-gxh7-wv9q-fwfr
Sep 6, 2023

## Package

npm

electron
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 22.0.0-beta.1 < 22.0.1, >= 23.0.0-alpha.1 < 23.0.0-alpha.2

## Patched versions

22.0.1, 23.0.0-alpha.2

## Description

### Impact

A Content-Security-Policy that disables eval, specifically setting a `script-src` directive and *not* providing `unsafe-eval` in that directive, is not respected in renderers that have sandbox and contextIsolation disabled. i.e. `sandbox: false` and `contextIsolation: false` in the `webPreferences` object.

This resulted in incorrectly allowing usage of methods like `eval()` and `new Function`, which can result in an expanded attack surface.

### Patches

This issue only ever affected the 22 and 23 major versions of Electron and has been fixed in the latest versions of those release lines. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes:

* 22.0.1
* 23.0.0-alpha.2

We recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron, especially if they use `sandbox: false` or `contextIsolation: false`.

### Workarounds

If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by enabling at least one of `sandbox: true` or `contextIsolation: true` on all renderers.

```
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    sandbox: true,
  }
});
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
