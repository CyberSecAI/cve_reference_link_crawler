Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient size validation of nested attributes within the `IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST` when processing rtnetlink messages. Specifically, the code was validating the attribute length against `NLA_HDRLEN` (4 bytes), which is less than the size of the expected structure `struct ifla_vf_vlan_info` (14 bytes).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the size of nested attributes within the `IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST`.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:**  A too-small attribute might be cast to `struct ifla_vf_vlan_info`. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read when the code tries to access the structure's members.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read access. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or other memory corruption issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **rtnetlink Messages:** An attacker can craft a malicious rtnetlink message with a nested `IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST` attribute containing a too small `IFLA_VF_VLAN_INFO` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access and privileges:** An attacker needs to be able to send rtnetlink messages, which typically requires some level of network access and privileges on the target system.

**More Details than the CVE Description:**
The provided content gives a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific code location, the incorrect size check, and how it leads to an out-of-bounds read. The commit message and diffs make it clear how the fix was implemented by changing the size check to compare against the size of `struct ifla_vf_vlan_info`.
