- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of LISP packets within the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of LISP packets can lead to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, the incorrect processing can trigger a device reload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This can disrupt network operations and accessibility of the device and services provided by it.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a crafted LISP packet to a vulnerable device over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending the crafted packet to an affected device. The attacker does not need to be on the local network or have any prior credentials.
