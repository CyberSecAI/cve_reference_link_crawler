The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from missing authorization checks when creating and saving views within the "Views for WPForms Lite" plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing capability checks:** The plugin did not properly verify if the current user has the necessary permissions ('manage_options') to create a new view or save changes to an existing view via AJAX requests.
- **Missing nonce verification:** The plugin lacked nonce checks for the AJAX action that creates a new view, meaning that the request could be initiated by an attacker without a valid session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially create new views and modify existing views without having the necessary administrative privileges. This could lead to:
-   **Unauthorized data access:** Views could be crafted to display sensitive information that an attacker should not be able to access
-   **Data manipulation:** An attacker could alter views to display data in a misleading way, or to manipulate existing data.
-   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could create or modify views to interfere with normal website operation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited through AJAX requests that create and save views without proper authorization checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site and have access to the AJAX endpoints used by the plugin. They would not need to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site.
