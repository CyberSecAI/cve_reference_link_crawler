SSA-459643: Denial of Service Vulnerability in RUGGEDCOM ROS
before V5.6.0

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 5.3

SUMMARY

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices are vulnerable to a denial of service attack (Slowloris). By sending
partial HTTP requests nonstop, with none completed, the affected web servers will be waiting for the
completion of each request, occupying all available HTTP connections. The web server recovers by itself
once the attack ends.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to port 80/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only
• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect
devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-39158

Affected devices improperly handle partial HTTP requests which makes them vulnerable to slowloris
attacks.

This could allow a remote attacker to create a denial of service condition that persists until the attack
ends.
