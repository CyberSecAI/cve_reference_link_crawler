*   The attacker does not require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker can be unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script via vulnerable input.
* The attacker needs no special access to the system, they just need to find the vulnerable input point.
