# (CVE-2023-43090) Screenshot tool allows viewing open windows when session is locked

Objet : RE: New Security Issue (Teams/Releng/security#112)

Thank you ! Here is the report.

GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux.
We discovered an authentication bypass that could be exploited to display the open applications while a GNOME session is locked.

Description

GNOME Screenshot is a utility for taking screenshots. It provides several options, including capturing the whole desktop or just a single window.

It could be executed through keyboard shortcuts or using the panel button. When the user session is locked, the "single window mode" and "video" capture buttons are disabled and it is not possible to click on it.

However, some keyboard shortcut has not been disabled and access to open applications is therefore possible.

Exploit

On a locked user session, GNOME Screenshot could be executed using the taskbar or keyboard PrtSc shortcut:

The "single window mode" and "video" buttons seem to be disabled:

However, we could access the user opened applications by pressing twice the "V" then once the "W" key:

[[https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo\_16x16.png]screenshot4.png](https://res-h3.public.cdn.office.net/assets/mail/file-icon/png/photo_16x16.png%5Dscreenshot4.png)[https://hubonefr-my.sharepoint.com/:i:/g/personal/mickael\_karatekin\_hubone\_fr/EerQMthoAtxBkV9GAkAWovoBjCVeIlv-yGm20ELQo28gAA](https://hubonefr-my.sharepoint.com/%3Ai%3A/g/personal/mickael_karatekin_hubone_fr/EerQMthoAtxBkV9GAkAWovoBjCVeIlv-yGm20ELQo28gAA)​

As a result, applications are displayed:

GNOME <= 44.4
