Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the GNOME Shell's screenshot tool not properly disabling all keyboard shortcuts when the user session is locked. Specifically, shortcuts related to window selection remained active.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Inadequate access control in the GNOME Shell's lock screen.
- Failure to disable all relevant keyboard shortcuts when the session is locked.
- The screenshot tool's "single window mode" and "video" buttons were disabled visually, but the underlying logic could still be triggered by keyboard shortcuts.
- The ability to bypass the intended restrictions on the screenshot tool by using keyboard shortcuts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An unauthenticated local user can view open windows of the locked desktop session. This allows an attacker to potentially view sensitive information that was visible on the user's screen before the session was locked, even though the graphical user interface was designed to prevent this.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local access is required.
- An attacker would need to use the keyboard.
- The attacker could start by triggering the screenshot tool with Print Screen (PrtSc).
- Subsequently, the attacker has to input specific keys to trigger window selection: 'v', 'v', 'w'.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs physical access to the machine.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker requires a basic understanding of keyboard shortcuts.
- The attacker is required to be able to press specific keyboard shortcuts on the locked device.

**Additional Details:**

- Affected versions: GNOME Shell 42, 43 (prior to 43.9), 44 (prior to 44.5).
- The issue was discovered by Mickael Karatekin at SysDream.
- The vulnerability was fixed in GNOME Shell 43.9 and 44.5.
- The fix involved disabling the ability to interact with the screenshot tool when the screen was locked.
- The original report references the ability to access the user opened applications by pressing twice the "V" key then once the "W" key.
