| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in [code-projects Blood Bank System up to 1.0](?product.code-projects:blood_bank_system). Affected is an unknown code of the file */admin/massage.php* of the component *Message Book*. The manipulation of the argument `bid` with the input value `2' AND (SELECT 1874 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))TlEY)-- jxOI` leads to a sql injection vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as [CWE-89](?vulnerability_cwe.280956 "Cwe"). The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. This is going to have an impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. CVE summarizes:
> A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in code-projects Blood Bank System up to 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /admin/massage.php. The manipulation of the argument bid leads to sql injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.
