- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of several parameters in the Elementor Website Builder Pro plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level permissions (or higher) can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. This script will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  By injecting malicious scripts via vulnerable parameters in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level permissions to exploit the vulnerability.
