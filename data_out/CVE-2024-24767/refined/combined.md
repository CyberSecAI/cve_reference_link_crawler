# Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts in CasaOS

High

[tigerinus](/tigerinus)
published
GHSA-c69x-5xmw-v44x
Mar 6, 2024

## Package

https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService
(Casa OS)

## Affected versions

v0.4.4.3

## Patched versions

v0.4.7

## Description

### Summary

Here it is observed that the CasaOS doesn't defend against password brute force attacks, which leads to having full access to the server.

### Details

The web application lacks control over the login attempts i.e. why attacker can use a password brute force attack to find and get full access over the.

### PoC

1. Capture login request in proxy tool like Burp Suite and select password field.

[![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297156515-0272bfd7-f386-4c22-b3bd-c4dbdc1298bf.PNG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297156515-0272bfd7-f386-4c22-b3bd-c4dbdc1298bf.PNG)

2. Here I have started attack with total number of 271 password tries where the last one is the correct password and as we can see in the following image we get a **400 Bad Request** status code with the message "**Invalid Password**" and response length **769** on 1st request which was sent at ***Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:31:32 GMT***

[![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297157815-c158995b-7d46-4a5a-aef9-bcbbcf596b15.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297157815-c158995b-7d46-4a5a-aef9-bcbbcf596b15.png)

**Note**: *We have tested this vulnerability with more than 3400 tries. We have used 271 request counts just for demo purposes.*

3. Here the attack is completed and we can see in the following image we get **200 OK** status code with the message "**Ok**" and response length **1509** on 271st request which was sent at ***Tue, 16 Jan 2024 18:32:01 GMT***.

[![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297159282-3f4788b5-6217-4f32-8be6-40ac117710e3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63414468/297159282-3f4788b5-6217-4f32-8be6-40ac117710e3.png)

This means attacker can try 271 requests in 56 seconds.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to get super user-level access over the server.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to implement a proper rate-limiting mechanism on the server side where the configuration might be like:

If a specific IP address fails to login more than 5 times concurrently then that IP address must be blocked for at least 30 seconds. This will reduce the possibility of password brute-forcing attacks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
