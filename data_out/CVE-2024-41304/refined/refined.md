The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WonderCMS version 3.4.3.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of uploaded SVG files. The application allows the upload of SVG files, which can contain embedded malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within the SVG file and stored on the server.
*   **Inadequate Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the content of the uploaded SVG files, allowing the embedded scripts to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the user accesses the uploaded SVG file.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The malicious JavaScript can be used to steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack a user's session.
*   **Phishing and Defacement:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code through the file upload functionality.
*   **User Interaction:** When a user accesses the uploaded SVG file, either directly or through some link or view within the application, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the admin page to access the file upload functionality.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious SVG Files:** The attacker needs to create or obtain an SVG file with embedded malicious JavaScript.
