{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to the parsing of PNG files, specifically the handling of chunk sizes during heap allocation. The `r4` chunk size is not correctly checked against the remaining image data, leading to an out-of-bounds read when processing subsequent chunks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking on chunk sizes",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Heap overflow or underflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a heap overflow or underflow, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted PNG file",
      "Triggering the vulnerable code by processing the crafted PNG file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted PNG file to the vulnerable application or library."
