## Package

suricata

## Affected versions

<=7.0.5

## Patched versions

7.0.6

## Description

### Impact

Crafted modbus traffic can lead to unlimited resource accumulation within a flow.

### Patches

Upgrade to 7.0.6.

### Workarounds

Disable the modbus parser if it is enabled. It is disabled by default.

Set a limited stream.reassembly.depth to reduce the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

---

**Description**

Found by oss-fuzz:
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=68270>

This can be abused by setting txs with alerts (like app-layer event invalid length) up to the 500 max txs, and then reiterating the 500 alerts for each tx at each packet...

Also, this shows a more generic attack :
A rule like `alert modbus any any -> any any (msg:"SURICATA Modbus invalid Length"; app-layer-event:modbus.invalid_length; classtype:protocol-command-decode; sid:2250003; rev:2;)` will be triggered multiple times for the same transaction if the transaction lives long
