Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It stems from the `qualification` parameter in the `sort2.php` file of the Record Management System.
- The application doesn't properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `qualification` parameter before rendering it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- The `sort2.php` page is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `qualification` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious script code into the web page.
- When a user visits the crafted URL, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- This allows the attacker to potentially:
    - Take control of the user's browser.
    - Steal user information (cookies, session tokens, etc.).
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the `qualification` parameter of the `sort2.php` page.
- The attacker then convinces a victim to visit the crafted URL, possibly through phishing or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- They must also be able to get a user to click on the link.

- Affected page: `sort2.php`
