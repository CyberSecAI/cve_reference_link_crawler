- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `floating_social_buttons_option()` function lacks proper nonce validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can update plugin settings and inject malicious web scripts.
- **Attack vectors**: A forged request, typically by tricking a site administrator into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action (like clicking a link) while the administrator is logged in.
