- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in IBM Robotic Process Automation runtime when the remote REST request computer policy is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure of script content.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive script content.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the vulnerability via remote REST requests when the computer policy is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make remote REST requests and the remote REST request computer policy must be enabled.
