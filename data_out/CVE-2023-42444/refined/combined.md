# panic on parsing crafted RFC3966 phonenumber inputs

High

[rubdos](/rubdos)
published
GHSA-whhr-7f2w-qqj2
Sep 19, 2023

## Package

cargo

phonenumber
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<0.3.3

## Patched versions

0.3.3,0.2.5

## Description

### Impact

The phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string.

In a typical deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the string `.;phone-context=`.

### Patches

Patches will be published as version `0.3.3+8.13.9` and backported as `0.2.5+8.11.3`.

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
