- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Flickr Justified Gallery plugin for WordPress versions 3.5 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case but in general this could allow an attacker to perform actions as if they were the victim user.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by crafting a request that a logged-in user would unknowingly execute, leading to unwanted actions being performed on the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to lure a logged-in user to click a malicious link or to visit a malicious page that triggers the forged request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target site.
