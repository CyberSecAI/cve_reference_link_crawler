The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** System command injection through the Netflow function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of input data when processing Netflow data, which allows an attacker to inject system commands.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting Pandora FMS. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Netflow function, likely by manipulating parameters related to source/destination IP/ports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to send malicious Netflow data to the Pandora FMS server or access an interface that uses Netflow data. It is not explicitly mentioned if authentication is required.
