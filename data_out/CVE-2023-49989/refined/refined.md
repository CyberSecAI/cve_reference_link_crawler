Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `update.php` file of the "Hotel Booking Management v1.0" application.
- The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the `id` parameter in `update.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- **Data Manipulation:** This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of existing data, or even deletion of data.
- **Potential for full database compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the database.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly stated, the example payload `sleep(20)` indicates the attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition by forcing the server to sleep.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is a simple HTTP GET request to `update.php`, where the malicious SQL payload is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Lack of authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and target the `update.php` endpoint.
- No special privileges or user accounts are needed. The attack can be performed remotely by anyone who can reach the affected application.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `update.php` file.
- A sample GET request to exploit the vulnerability is provided: `GET /HotelBookingManagement-main/update.php?id=1%20and%20(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)--%20 HTTP/1.1`
- The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter (e.g., `1 and (select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)-- `)
- The injected `sleep()` function in the example demonstrates the ability to execute SQL functions and indicates a potential for more malicious code execution.
- The application uses PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS.
- The database is MySQL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content shows that the vulnerable application is a Hotel Booking Management System.
- The github repository [pratham-jaiswal/HotelBookingManagement](https://github.com/pratham-jaiswal/HotelBookingManagement) contains the vulnerable code, as shown by the presence of `update.php`
- A separate github repository [geraldoalcantara/CVE-2023-49989](https://github.com/geraldoalcantara/CVE-2023-49989) is dedicated to describing this CVE.
