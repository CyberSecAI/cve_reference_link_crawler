**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “Customer File Upload-Attach File on Product,Cart pages” (fileuploads) up to version 2.0.3 from FME Modules for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-33270](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-33270)
* **Published at**: 2024-04-29
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: fileuploads
* **Impacted release**: <= 2.0.3 (2.0.4 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: FME Modules
* **Weakness**: [CWE-359](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html)
* **Severity**: high (7.5), GDPR violation

## Description

Due to a lack of permissions control, a guest can download all files uploaded by customers which could be national identity card / contents under NDA, etc.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller’s path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see “POST /” inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod\_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.
