  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the shader_glsl_get_register_name function, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading past the end of an allocated buffer. This can potentially be used to execute code in the context of the hypervisor when combined with other vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to guest OS",
       "MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) - used for network communication in VirtualBox"

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system."
