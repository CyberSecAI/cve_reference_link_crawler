# Credential leak when credentials are used with `<nix/fetchurl.nix>`

Moderate

[edolstra](/edolstra)
published
GHSA-6fjr-mq49-mm2c
Sep 26, 2024

## Package

nix
(Nix)

## Affected versions

<= 2.24.7

## Patched versions

2.18.8, 2.24.8

## Description

### Impact

`<nix/fetchurl.nix>` historically did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

Important

`<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function [`builtins.fetchurl`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/builtins#builtins-fetchurl), which was not affected by this issue.

You may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if you have a [`netrc`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-netrc-file) file for authentication, or rely on derivations with [`impureEnvVars`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/advanced-attributes.html#adv-attr-impureEnvVars) set to use credentials from the environment.

In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the [impure derivations](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/development/experimental-features.html#impure-derivations) experimental feature.

Note that this may also happen when using [Nixpkgs fetchers](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#chap-pkgs-fetchers) to [obtain new hashes](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-secure-hashes) when not using the [fake hash method](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-updating-source-hashes-fakehash-method), although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation.

The behavior was introduced in [5db358d](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/5db358d4d78aea7204a8f22c5bf2a309267ee038) to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` work in the [derivation builder](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/derivations.html#attr-builder) sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux.

### Patches

This issue has been fixed on [Nix master](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/11585) and in Nix 2.24.8.

### Workarounds

Implement (authenticated) fetching with [`pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-fetchurl), using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | prs: [11585] |
|  |  | --- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Previously `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` did not do TLS verification. This was because the Nix sandbox in the past did not have access to TLS certificates, and Nix checks the hash of the fetched file anyway. However, this can expose authentication data from `netrc` and URLs to man-in-the-middle attackers. In addition, Nix now in some cases (such as when using impure derivations) does \*not\* check the hash. Therefore we have now enabled TLS verification. This means that downloads by `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` will now fail if you're fetching from a HTTPS server that does not have a valid certificate. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issues. |

### @edolstra **[edolstra](/edolstra)** commented [Sep 25, 2024](#issue-2548796004)

# Motivation

Once upon a time we disabled this because we didn't have access to the certificates in the sandbox, and verification wasn't really needed because we're checking the hash of the download afterwards. But these days we do have access to certificates in the sandbox, and features like impure derivations make the second assumption no longer valid. So let's re-enable checking.

# Context

# Priorities and Process

Add 👍 to [pull requests you find important](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

The Nix maintainer team uses a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/projects/19) to [schedule and track reviews](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tree/master/maintainers#project-board-protocol).

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is better for privacy and to avoid leaking netrc credentials in a
MITM attack, but also the assumption that we check the hash no longer
holds in some cases (in particular for impure derivations).

This makes it consistent with the Nixpkgs fetchurl and makes it work
in chroots. We don't need verification because the hash of the result
is checked anyway.

What's the reasoning behind this? I understand making certificates available inside a derivation is tricky, but with [0a2bee3](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/0a2bee307b20411f5b0dda0c662b1f9bb9e0e131) that's not necessary anymore. While not strictly necessary it seems desirable to have verification on (at least by default).

In general, I *think* it would be nicer to still verify certificates by default; two possible reasons:

* slight privacy improvement, as there could be a man-in-the-middle watching what you (attempt to) download;
* the workflow where you `fetchurl` with an incorrect hash to find the correct one; it seems relatively common to do that, sometimes for lack of a practical alternative (like in case of `fetchpatch`)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Yeah, I would like to replace this with a nix.conf option but wanted to check since this was added explicitly.

Privacy improvement is a bit less than they seem, as the target server and package size are usually possible to observe. TOFU is a popular workflow, though.

Right, it's not much. The privacy point only holds more significantly for binary caches, which is something else.
