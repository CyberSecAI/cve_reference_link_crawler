# Credential leak when credentials are used with `<nix/fetchurl.nix>`

Moderate

[edolstra](/edolstra)
published
GHSA-6fjr-mq49-mm2c
Sep 26, 2024

## Package

nix
(Nix)

## Affected versions

<= 2.24.7

## Patched versions

2.18.8, 2.24.8

## Description

### Impact

`<nix/fetchurl.nix>` historically did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

Important

`<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function [`builtins.fetchurl`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/builtins#builtins-fetchurl), which was not affected by this issue.

You may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if you have a [`netrc`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-netrc-file) file for authentication, or rely on derivations with [`impureEnvVars`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/advanced-attributes.html#adv-attr-impureEnvVars) set to use credentials from the environment.

In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the [impure derivations](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/development/experimental-features.html#impure-derivations) experimental feature.

Note that this may also happen when using [Nixpkgs fetchers](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#chap-pkgs-fetchers) to [obtain new hashes](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-secure-hashes) when not using the [fake hash method](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-updating-source-hashes-fakehash-method), although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation.

The behavior was introduced in [5db358d](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/5db358d4d78aea7204a8f22c5bf2a309267ee038) to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` work in the [derivation builder](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/language/derivations.html#attr-builder) sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux.

### Patches

This issue has been fixed on [Nix master](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/11585) and in Nix 2.24.8.

### Workarounds

Implement (authenticated) fetching with [`pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-pkgs-fetchers-fetchurl), using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
