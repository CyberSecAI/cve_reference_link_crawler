Disable TLS verification for builtin fetchurl

This makes it consistent with the Nixpkgs fetchurl and makes it work
in chroots. We don't need verification because the hash of the result
is checked anyway.

What's the reasoning behind this? I understand making certificates available inside a derivation is tricky, but with [0a2bee3](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/0a2bee307b20411f5b0dda0c662b1f9bb9e0e131) that's not necessary anymore. While not strictly necessary it seems desirable to have verification on (at least by default).

In general, I *think* it would be nicer to still verify certificates by default; two possible reasons:

* slight privacy improvement, as there could be a man-in-the-middle watching what you (attempt to) download;
* the workflow where you `fetchurl` with an incorrect hash to find the correct one; it seems relatively common to do that, sometimes for lack of a practical alternative (like in case of `fetchpatch`)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Yeah, I would like to replace this with a nix.conf option but wanted to check since this was added explicitly.

Privacy improvement is a bit less than they seem, as the target server and package size are usually possible to observe. TOFU is a popular workflow, though.

Right, it's not much. The privacy point only holds more significantly for binary caches, which is something else.
