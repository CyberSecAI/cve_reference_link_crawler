Hide window immediately if itself doesn't run hide animationThe condition was overextended in commit 9bca6b4 which checks if theparent container of the window is animating. That causes the window towait for animation finish to update visibility, but the animationfinish callback won't happen because itself is not animating. Then thewindow that should be hidden remains on screen.Bug: 302431573Test: atest WindowStateTests#testIsOnScreen\_hiddenByPolicy(cherry picked from commit 9add9281ffc120c81a7d125892803f1beb5ddcb3)(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:10a7f0914c87f4af521b5cbb13e84a83dacebf82)Merged-In: Iafc2b2c2a24d8fc8d147354ef2f0b4afeeb510c5Change-Id: Iafc2b2c2a24d8fc8d147354ef2f0b4afeeb510c5
