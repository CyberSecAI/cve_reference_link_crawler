A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions < V3.2 SP1). The affected application does not properly assign rights to temporary files created during its update process. This could allow an authenticated attacker with the 'Manage firmware updates' role to escalate their privileges on the underlying OS level.
