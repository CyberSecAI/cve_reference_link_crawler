Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-41722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin has a weak authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- It's possible to inject custom messages with any Group ID (GID) and callsign into existing goTenna mesh networks using a software-defined radio.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary messages.
- If encryption is not used, or if the encryption has been compromised, the attacker can spoof messages and potentially disrupt communication or insert false information.
- This compromise can impact the confidentiality of the communication by injecting messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation requires adjacent network access.
- An attacker needs a software-defined radio to inject the malicious messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of the goTenna mesh network.
- The attacker needs to possess a software-defined radio and knowledge to craft and inject messages.
- The vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.
- The advisory recommends using encryption shared via local QR code for higher security.
- This vulnerability is listed as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication).
