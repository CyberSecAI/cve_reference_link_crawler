{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of unbounded format strings in `fscanf` when parsing OFF files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflows occur due to unbounded format strings in `fscanf`. The `fscanf` function writes data into fixed-size stack buffers without proper length checks, leading to overflows when the input exceeds buffer capacity.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted .off file processed by a vulnerable version of libigl can trigger the buffer overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious .off file to an application using the vulnerable libigl library. This could be achieved through user interaction (e.g., opening a malicious file) or other means where the application parses attacker-controlled OFF files."
