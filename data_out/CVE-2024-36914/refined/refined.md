The provided content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises due to the dynamic memory safety error detector (KASAN) detecting "slab-out-of-bounds" errors. This occurs because the writeback connector in the AMD display driver does not support certain features that are not initialized, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during operations related to these uninitialized features.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access when handling writeback connectors.
- Incomplete initialization of certain features for writeback connectors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to memory safety violation detected by KASAN
- Potential undefined behavior arising from out-of-bounds memory access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering operations involving writeback connectors that try to access uninitialized or unsupported features of the connector, potentially by using specific display configurations or display manager operations that exercise the affected code paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the affected code paths in the AMD display driver. This may involve configuring displays or using specific applications or system configurations. Access to the display subsystem is needed.
