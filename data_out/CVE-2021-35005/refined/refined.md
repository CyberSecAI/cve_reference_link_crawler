Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the TeamViewer service. This leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of array index data provided by a user. This allows for out-of-bounds read access.
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The lack of input validation leads to an out-of-bounds read on an allocated array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By triggering the out-of-bounds read, an attacker can disclose sensitive information from the TeamViewer service's memory.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The disclosed memory can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially escalate privileges and achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Shared Memory Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate shared memory to trigger the out-of-bounds read within the TeamViewer service.
*   **Log File Access**:  The service writes the out-of-bounds read data to the log file, which can be read by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local, low-privileged access:** The attacker must be able to execute code with low privileges on the target machine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in TeamViewer version 15.21.2, released on August 24th, 2021.
*   The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Kharosx0 and the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vendor stated there was no indication of exploitation in the wild.
