Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28735:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `shim_lock` verifier within GRUB2. This verifier is responsible for ensuring that only trusted kernel files are loaded during secure boot. However, it incorrectly allows non-kernel files to pass verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper verification of file types: The `shim_lock` verifier fails to properly distinguish between kernel files and other types of files, allowing the loading of non-kernel files. This bypasses the intended security mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Secure boot bypass: By loading non-kernel files, the secure boot trust chain is broken, potentially enabling an attacker to load malicious or unverified code early in the boot process. This can lead to various impacts, including arbitrary code execution and complete system compromise.
- Loading unverified code: The ability to load non-kernel files allows for loading of untrusted and potentially malicious code/modules during boot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker with local access and sufficient privileges can replace a boot file with a crafted non-kernel file to be loaded.
- Pre-boot environment: The vulnerability is triggered in the pre-boot environment during the GRUB2 boot process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access with elevated privileges: The attacker requires the ability to modify files within the boot environment or have sufficient access to modify boot parameters.
- Ability to craft or provide a non-kernel file.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves modifying `grub-core/kern/efi/sb.c` to reject non-kernel files in the `shim_lock` verifier.
*   The vulnerability is specific to systems using shim-powered secure boot.

The NetApp advisory confirms the vulnerability in GRUB2 versions prior to 2.06-3 and states that a successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). The provided CVSS score is 7.8 (HIGH), with the vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which indicates low complexity, local access, low privileges, no user interaction required, and high impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
