Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-36620:

**CVE-2023-36620: ADB Backup Allowed**

*   **Root Cause:** The Boomerang Parental Control app for Android lacks the `android:allowBackup="false"` attribute in its manifest file.
*   **Weakness:** This omission allows any user with ADB access enabled on the device to create a full backup of the application's internal data, including sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with physical access to the device or access via recovery can use the backup to extract:
    *   Device token.
    *   API token.
    *   Other internal data.
    *   These tokens enable the attacker to impersonate the child or parent device and perform API calls with the same access rights.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs:
    *   Physical access to the Android device with the Boomerang app installed.
    *   ADB enabled (or access through recovery).
    *   Ability to execute `adb backup` commands from a connected computer
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have the ability to use ADB to backup the app's data and extract the tokens from the backup files. They must also be able to craft and send HTTP requests.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The vulnerability is present in versions < 13.83 of the Boomerang Parental Control app.
    *   The vendor fixed this specific issue in version >= 13.83.
    *   This vulnerability is a prerequisite to exploiting some of the other mentioned vulnerabilities, such as stored XSS and privilege escalation.

**Summary of related findings:**
*   The extracted tokens can be used to perform other actions, like using the stored XSS vulnerability, and privilege escalation.
*   The backup can be obtained through ADB, or via recovery mode.
*   The ability to perform an ADB backup also facilitates the privilege escalation vulnerability and makes it easier to perform an XSS attack by allowing for crafting of API requests by the attacker.
