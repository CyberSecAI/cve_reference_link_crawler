Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-4839:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the WP Go Maps plugin's admin settings. Specifically, user-supplied custom CSS was not properly sanitized before being output in the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization for custom CSS in plugin settings
- Improper output escaping when rendering custom CSS

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- The injected scripts execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- The attacker can potentially perform actions like redirecting users, stealing cookies, or defacing the website, depending on the injected code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's admin settings page, specifically the custom CSS option.
- An attacker would insert malicious JavaScript code within the custom CSS field.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin renders the stored custom CSS on the site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level permissions or above.
- The attacker must be able to access and modify the plugin settings.
- The vulnerability affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 9.0.32 of the WP Go Maps plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 9.0.33 by applying the wp_strip_all_tags function to the custom CSS input. This function removes all HTML and PHP tags from the input, preventing the execution of arbitrary code.
- The Wordfence researchers, Marco Wotschka and Akbar Kustirama, are credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
- The plugin also fixed an additional XSS vulnerability related to the map shortcode classname attribute.
- The plugin also improved shortcode attribute security by escaping attributes further, based on recent security reports.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on March 12, 2024, and last updated on March 13, 2024.
