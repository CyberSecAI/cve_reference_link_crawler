Please upgrade immediately to version 1.4.10 or higher to fix security vulnerability, CVE-2022-23775. Contract TrueStack at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) if you have any trouble upgrading. New instances purchased from the AWS marketplace will be versions 1.4.10 or higher.

To upgrade:

* On the Admin tab in the console click on Update, notice the version number at the bottom of the screen.

**Troubleshoot upgrading:**

* Follow these steps:* First backup your instance from the Admin tab of the TrueStack Direct Connect Console.
  * Download and install Putty from [here.](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) or use another SSH tool if you have one.
