## üöÄ Features

### GraphOS Enterprise: Authorization ([PR #3397](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3397), [PR #3662](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3662))

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an [Enterprise feature](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/platform/evaluating-apollo-router-understanding-free-and-open-vs-commercial-features/) of the Apollo Router. It requires an organization with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/).
>
> If your organization doesn't currently have an Enterprise plan, you can test out this functionality by signing up for a free [Enterprise trial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/org/plans/#enterprise-trials).

We introduce two new directives, `@requiresScopes` and `@authenticated`, that define authorization policies for fields and types in the supergraph schema, composed with Federation version 2.5.3 or higher.

They are defined as follows:

```
scalar federation__Scope
directive @requiresScopes(scopes: [[federation__Scope!]!]!) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

This directive allows granular access control through user-defined scopes.

```
directive @authenticated on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

This directive allows access to the annotated field or type for authenticated requests only.

For more information on how to use these directives, please read Apollo Router [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authorization)

## üêõ Fixes

### Subscriptions: Correct v1.28.x regression allowing panic via un-named subscription operation

Correct a regression that was introduced in Router v1.28.0 which made a Router **panic** possible when the following *three* conditions are *all* met:

1. When sending an un-named (i.e., "anonymous") `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`); **and**;
2. The Router has a `subscription` type defined in the Supergraph schema; **and**
3. Have subscriptions enabled (they are disabled by default) in the Router's YAML configuration, either by setting `enabled: true` *or* by setting a `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [the subscriptions documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup).

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in [#3738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3738)

### Update Deno to resolve Rust Docs generation failure ([Issue #3305](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3305))

We've updated to the latest version of Deno (0.200) to fix errors when generating [docs.rs/apollo-router](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/latest).

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in [#3626](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3626)

### GraphQL response processing is now captured under the execution span ([PR #3732](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3732))

Ensure processing is captured under the "execution" span. Previously, events would be reported under the supergraph span or ‚Äî even more arbitrarily ‚Äî any plugin's span (e.g., Rhai).

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in [#3732](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3732)

## üõ† Maintenance

### Apollo Uplink connections re-use the existing HTTP client ([Issue #3333](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3333))

A single HTTP client will now be shared between requests of the same type when making requests to [Apollo Uplink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/) to fetch supergraphs, licenses and configuration from Studio. Previously, such requests created a new HTTP client on each periodic fetch which occasionally resulted in CPU spikes, especially on macOS.

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in [#3703](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3703)

### Remove unneeded schema parsing steps ([PR #3547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3547))

Access to a parsed schema is required in various parts of the Router. Previously were were parsing the schema multiple times, but this is now fixed.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in [#3547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3547)
