## Description

### Impact

This is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled. It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**:

1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 ("impacted versions"); **and**
2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration) **has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and**
3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are *disabled* by default), either by setting `enabled: true` *or* by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and**
4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router

If **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate. There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability.

Depending on the environment in which impacted versions are running and the high-availability characteristics of that environment, a single Router's termination may result in limited or reduced availability or other knock-on effects which are deployment-specific (e.g., depending on if there are multiple instances, auto-restart policies, etc.)

### Discovery

This vulnerability was discovered by an internal Apollo team. We have no reports or evidence to support that that has been exploited outside of our own testing, research and follow-up.

Our public security policy can be reviewed at <https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/policy> and we consider the security of our projects a top priority. Please review the linked policy for more details.

### Patches

This is fixed in [Apollo Router v1.29.1](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1), which is available on:

* [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) as `v1.29.1`
* [GitHub Packages Container Registry](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router) as `v1.29.1`
* [Helm Chart Repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/helm-charts/router) as `1.29.1` (without the `v`)

We recommend all users running the impacted configuration above to update to a patched version of the Router immediately. Router v1.29.1 should be a very simple upgrade from any impacted version.

### Workarounds

Updating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions. However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph – but are enabled via configuration — then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the `router` repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router)
* Email us at `security` `[at]` `apollographql` `[dot]` `com`

… subscription operation ([#3738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3738))

### Subscriptions: Correct v1.28.x regression allowing panic via un-named subscription operation

Correct a regression that was introduced in Router v1.28.0 which made a Router **panic** possible when the following _three_ conditions are _all_ met:

1. When sending an un-named (i.e., "anonymous") `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`); **and**;
2. The Router has a `subscription` type defined in the Supergraph schema; **and**
3. Have subscriptions enabled (they are disabled by default) in the Router's YAML configuration, either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [the subscriptions documentation]
```

## 🚀 Features

### GraphOS Enterprise: Authorization ([PR #3397](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3397), [PR #3662](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3662))

> ⚠️ This is an [Enterprise feature](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/platform/evaluating-apollo-router-understanding-free-and-open-vs-commercial-features/) of the Apollo Router. It requires an organization with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/).
>
> If your organization doesn't currently have an Enterprise plan, you can test out this functionality by signing up for a free [Enterprise trial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/org/plans/#enterprise-trials).

We introduce two new directives, `@requiresScopes` and `@authenticated`, that define authorization policies for fields and types in the supergraph schema, composed with Federation version 2.5.3 or higher.

They are defined as follows:

```
scalar federation__Scope
directive @requiresScopes(scopes: [[federation__Scope!]!]!) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

This directive allows granular access control through user-defined scopes.

```
directive @authenticated on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION | INTERFACE | SCALAR | ENUM
```

This directive allows access to the annotated field or type for authenticated requests only.

For more information on how to use these directives, please read Apollo Router [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/authorization)

## 🐛 Fixes

### Subscriptions: Correct v1.28.x regression allowing panic via un-named subscription operation

Correct a regression that was introduced in Router v1.28.0 which made a Router **panic** possible when the following *three* conditions are *all* met:

1. When sending an un-named (i.e., "anonymous") `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`); **and**;
2. The Router has a `subscription` type defined in the Supergraph schema; **and**
3. Have subscriptions enabled (they are disabled by default) in the Router's YAML configuration, either by setting `enabled: true` *or* by setting a `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [the subscriptions documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup).

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in [#3738](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3738)

### Update Deno to resolve Rust Docs generation failure ([Issue #3305](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3305))

We've updated to the latest version of Deno (0.200) to fix errors when generating [docs.rs/apollo-router](https://docs.rs/crate/apollo-router/latest).

By [@o0Ignition0o](https://github.com/o0Ignition0o) in [#3626](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3626)

### GraphQL response processing is now captured under the execution span ([PR #3732](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3732))

Ensure processing is captured under the "execution" span. Previously, events would be reported under the supergraph span or — even more arbitrarily — any plugin's span (e.g., Rhai).

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in [#3732](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3732)

## 🛠 Maintenance

### Apollo Uplink connections re-use the existing HTTP client ([Issue #3333](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/3333))

A single HTTP client will now be shared between requests of the same type when making requests to [Apollo Uplink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/) to fetch supergraphs, licenses and configuration from Studio. Previously, such requests created a new HTTP client on each periodic fetch which occasionally resulted in CPU spikes, especially on macOS.

By [@BrynCooke](https://github.com/BrynCooke) in [#3703](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3703)

### Remove unneeded schema parsing steps ([PR #3547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3547))

Access to a parsed schema is required in various parts of the Router. Previously were were parsing the schema multiple times, but this is now fixed.

By [@Geal](https://github.com/Geal) in [#3547](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/3547)
