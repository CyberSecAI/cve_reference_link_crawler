 umask for deamons

Hello Jedidiah,

Thanks for contributing to the oss-security list; I believe your
contributions would be far more valuable if they included some further
details -- providing links to issues and commits is common, but you could
also include the details in the email if that's easier for whatever reason.

Thanks
