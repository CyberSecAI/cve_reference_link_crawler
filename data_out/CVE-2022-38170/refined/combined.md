Subject: CVE-2022-38170: Apache Airflow: Overly permissive umask for
 deamons

Description:

In Apache Airflow prior to 2.3.4, an insecure umask was configured for numerous Airflow components when running with the  `--deamon` flag which could result in a race condition giving world-writable files in the Airflow home directory and allowing local users to expose arbitrary file contents via the webserver.

Mitigation:

Run without the `--deamon` flag via a process supervisor instead (systemd, runit, etc.).

Credit:

The Apache Airflow PMC would like to thank Harry Sintonen for reporting this issue.

Hello Jedidiah,

Thanks for contributing to the oss-security list; I believe your
contributions would be far more valuable if they included some further
details -- providing links to issues and commits is common, but you could
also include the details in the email if that's easier for whatever reason.

Thanks
