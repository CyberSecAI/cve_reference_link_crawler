We are the BASS team from the School of Cyber Science and Technology at Beihang University. Our main focus is on system software security, operating systems, and program analysis research, as well as the development of automated program testing frameworks for detecting software defects. Using our self-developed database vulnerability testing tool, we have identified the above-mentioned vulnerabilities in TiDB that may lead to database crashes.
