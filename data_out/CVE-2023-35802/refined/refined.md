- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the implementation of the CAPWAP protocol within the IQ Engine (HiveOS) and VGVA/CVG products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain elevated privileges and achieve remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the CAPWAP protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the internal management interface/subnet to exploit this vulnerability.
