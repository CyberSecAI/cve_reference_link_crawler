* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: AIX is vulnerable to a privilege escalation vulnerability due to invscout (CVE-2022-36768)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in the AIX invscout command could allow a non-privileged local user to obtain root privileges (CVE-2022-36768).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2022-36768](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36768)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| AIX | 7.1 |
| AIX | 7.2 |
| AIX | 7.3 |
| VIOS | 3.1 |

The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

| Fileset | Lower Level | Upper Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| invscout.rte | 2.2.0.0 | 2.2.0.22 |

To find out whether the affected filesets are installed on your systems, refer to the lslpp command found in AIX user's guide.

Example:  lslpp -L | grep -i invscout.rte

## Remediation/Fixes

**A. FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

AIX and VIOS fixes are available.

The AIX and VIOS fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:
ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout\_fix3.tar
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout_fix3.tar>
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout_fix3.tar>

The link above is to a tar file containing this signed advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package. The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX Technology Levels.

For AIX 7.1, 7.2, and VIOS 3.1, you must be on the 'bos.rte.libc prereq' level before installing the new invscout.rte package.

| AIX Level | bos.rte.libc prereq |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1 | 7.1.5.30 |
| 7.2 | 7.2.3.0 |

| VIOS Level | bos.rte.libc prereq |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1 | 7.2.3.0 |

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

tar xvf invscout\_fix3.tar
cd invscout\_fix3

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [filename]" command as the following:

| openssl dgst -sha256 | filename |
| --- | --- |
| 7a3ad189232a95fe99eb88fc6faf890ee2ae9076e863d31e4fa97c9835aeb32a | invscout.rte |

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM Support at <http://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

Published advisory OpenSSL signature file location:
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout_advisory3.asc.sig>
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout_advisory3.asc.sig>
ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/invscout\_advisory3.asc.sig

**B. FIX INSTALLATION**

If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview the fix installation:

installp -apYd . invscout

To install the fix package:

installp -aXYd . invscout
