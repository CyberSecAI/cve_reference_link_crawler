Sudo Privilege Escalation affecting WALLIX Products – CVE-2021-3156

###### SUMMARY

The Qualys Research Team has discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in sudo (CVE-2021-3156), any local unprivileged user can gain root privileges on a vulnerable host using a default sudo configuration by exploiting this vulnerability.

sudo can only be exploited locally. This means that either :

* The user is connected on the WALLIX Bastion, through the wabadmin account, on the administration interface. This user can then exploit sudo to become root and bypass all securities of WALLIX Bastion
* A Remote Code Exploitation (RCE) vulnerability exists in another piece of WALLIX software or third party, that will provides a local shell. After successfully exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker will be able to exploit sudo to become root. To WALLIX knowledge, an up-to-date Bastion does not have such vulnerability

###### Affected Products

* All versions prior to WALLIX Bastion 8.0.6 (included)
* All versions 8.1 and 8.2

###### Workarounds

There is no workaround to this vulnerability

###### Fixed Software

This vulnerability is fixed from the WALLIX Bastion 8.0.7 on, and 7.0.14  on.

* A Fix Patch is available for version 8.0.6 and before (it applies for 8.1 and 8.2 versions)
* A Fix patch is available for version 7.0.13 and before
