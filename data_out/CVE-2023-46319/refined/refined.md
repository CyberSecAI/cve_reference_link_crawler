The provided content is a security advisory from Wallix regarding several vulnerabilities in their products. However, the specific CVE-2023-46319 is not mentioned. The most relevant vulnerability described in the document is identified with a placeholder `CVE-2024-XXXXX`.

Here's the breakdown of the most relevant vulnerability, using the information provided for the placeholder CVE:

**Vulnerability:**

- **Description:**  The vulnerability relates to a bypass of disabled or expired user accounts. Specifically, WALLIX Bastion and WALLIX Access Manager do not properly check for expired or disabled flags when authenticating users via SSH keys or X.509 certificates stored in LDAP or Active Directory.
- **Products Affected:**
    - WALLIX Bastion (all versions 12.0 up to 12.0.3, 11.0, 10.x, 9.x and prior)
    - WALLIX Access Manager (versions 5.1.0, 5.0, 4.4, 4.0.x and prior)
-   **Root Cause**: Failure to check account status flags during authentication
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    -  Improper authentication validation.
- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to WALLIX Bastion and/or WALLIX Access Manager.
    - Potentially, unauthorized access to target systems managed by Bastion/Access Manager if the user credentials (SSH private key or X.509 private key associated to the certificate) are valid.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Authentication through SSH key or X.509 certificate with an expired or disabled account.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**
    - The attacker needs to have access to valid user credentials and to have the SSH key or certificate hash stored in Active Directory or LDAP user account for an account that should have been disabled or is expired.

**Workarounds:**

- Removing SSH key or certificate hash from the Active Directory or LDAP user account.
- Revoking X.509 certificates using CRLs if configured.
-  For Bastion, adding "userAccountControl" and “krbPasswordExpiration” attributes to LDAP configuration to correctly evaluate the account status.

**Fixes:**

- WALLIX Bastion 12.0.4
- WALLIX Access Manager 5.1.1
- WALLIX Bastion 10.0.10
- WALLIX Access Manager 4.0.8
