Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `print.php` page of the "itsourcecode Project Expense Monitoring System v1.0". Specifically, the `map_id` parameter, which is passed through a GET request, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `map_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Reading sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, financial information).
    - **Data Modification:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative access to the database server.
    - **Denial of Service:** Causing the database server to crash or become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted GET request to the `print.php` page.
- **`map_id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected into the `map_id` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
- **Web Browser or HTTP Client:** The attacker would use a web browser or a tool like `curl` to send the crafted request.

**Specific Payload Examples:**
- **Error-based Injection:**
   ```
   map_id=67' AND GTID_SUBSET(CONCAT(0x7162627a71,(SELECT (ELT(5075=5075,1))),0x716b717671),5075)-- xGVQ
   ```
   This payload exploits MySQL's error reporting to extract information.
- **Time-based Blind Injection:**
   ```
    map_id=67' AND (SELECT 2049 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))IStZ)-- PtEB
   ```
   This payload utilizes the `SLEEP` function to induce a time delay, allowing attackers to infer results without direct output.
