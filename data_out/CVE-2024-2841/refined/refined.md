Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes, specifically the `id` attribute within the Otter Blocks plugin widgets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses an affected page. This can lead to malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser session (e.g., cookie theft, redirection to malicious pages).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's widgets, where user-supplied attributes, such as the `id` attribute, are not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level access or above to WordPress.

**Additional Information**
* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 2.6.5 of the plugin. It was fixed in version 2.6.6 by improving sanitization of the SSR (Server Side Rendering) blocks
* The fix includes:
    *   Escaping the `id` attribute with `esc_attr()` in `class-leaflet-map-block.php`, `class-masonry-variant.php`, and `class-review-block.php`.
    *   Using `esc_attr()` on the `class` attribute in `class-posts-grid-block.php`
    *   Using `esc_html()` on multiple attributes such as `mainHeading`, `subHeading`, `description`, `prosLabel`, `consLabel`, and `buttonsLabel` in `class-review-block.php`
    *   Using `esc_url()` on the image URL in `class-review-block.php`.
    *   Using `esc_attr()` on attributes such as image size and link target in `class-review-block.php`.
    *   Using `wp_kses_post` on the final HTML output of `class-review-block.php`.
    *   Using `esc_url()` on image URL, and `esc_attr()` on the description in `class-stripe-checkout-block.php`.
