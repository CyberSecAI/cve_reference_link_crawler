Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21252:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2023-21252
*   **Description:** The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) issue in the Wi-Fi module of Android.
*   **Root Cause:** The root cause lies in the lack of proper input validation for WAPI passwords and preshared keys, allowing for arbitrarily large passwords/keys which can cause denial of service.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient input validation. Specifically, the vulnerability exists because the system doesn't limit the size of passwords and preshared keys used in WAPI.
*   **Impact:**  Exploitation can result in a denial of service on the affected device. An attacker can potentially disrupt the device's Wi-Fi functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:** This issue is triggered when a device connects to a Wi-Fi network using WAPI with an overly large password or preshared key.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to control or be able to set up a malicious Wi-Fi access point using the WAPI protocol and then entice a target device to connect.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android versions 11, 12, 12L, and 13 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed by implementing size limits for WAPI passwords and preshared keys.
*   **Patch Information:**
