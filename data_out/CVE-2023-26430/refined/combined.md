Internal reference: OXUIB-2282
Type: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
Component: frontend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev27
First fixed revision: OX App Suite frontend 7.10.6-rev28
Discovery date: 2023-03-20
Solution date: 2023-04-20
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
CVE: CVE-2023-26445
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L)

Details:
Themes can be abused to inject script code for persistent XSS. Frontend themes are defined by user-controllable jslob
settings and could point to a malicious resource which gets processed during login.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering
unwanted actions via the web interface and API. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the users
account or lure a user to a compromised account. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We now sanitize the theme value and use a default fallback if no theme matches.

Internal reference: MWB-1877
Type: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev42, OX App Suite backend 8.10
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev43, OX App Suite backend 8.11
Discovery date: 2022-10-17
Solution date: 2023-04-27
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
CVE: CVE-2023-26438
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
SSRF using DNS rebinding attacks. External service lookups for a number of protocols were vulnerable to a
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) weakness, involving the JDK DNS cache. Attackers that were timing DNS cache expiry
correctly were able to inject configuration that would bypass existing network deny-lists.

Risk:
Attackers could exploit this weakness to discover the existence of restricted network infrastructure and service
availability. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
Improvements were made to include deny-lists not only during the check of the provided connection data, but also during
use.

Internal reference: MWB-2020
Type: CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev42, OX App Suite backend 8.10
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev43, OX App Suite backend 8.11
Discovery date: 2023-01-23
Solution date: 2023-04-26
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
Researcher credits: Tim 'foobar7' Coen
CVE: CVE-2023-26430
CVSS: 3.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

Details:
Mailfilter (SIEVE) rules accept control characters. Attackers with access to user accounts can inject arbitrary control
characters to SIEVE mail-filter rules.

Risk:
This could be abused to access SIEVE extension that are not allowed by App Suite or to inject rules which would break
per-user filter processing, requiring manual cleanup of such rules. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We have added sanitization to all mail-filter APIs to avoid forwardning control characters to subsystems.

---

Internal reference: MWB-2086
Type: CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev42, OX App Suite backend 8.11
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev43, OX App Suite backend 8.12
Discovery date: 2023-03-14
Solution date: 2023-04-27
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
Researcher credits: Mehmet 'mdisec' Ince
CVE: CVE-2023-26443
CVSS: 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

Details:
Potentially malicious SQL injection when using full-text autocomplete. Full-text autocomplete search allows
user-provided SQL syntax to be injected to SQL statements.

Risk:
With existing sanitization in place, this can be abused to trigger benign SQL Exceptions but could potentially be
escalated to a malicious SQL injection vulnerability. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We now properly encode single quotes for SQL FULLTEXT queries.

---

Internal reference: MWB-2102
Type: CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values)
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 8.11
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 8.12
Discovery date: 2023-03-27
Solution date: 2023-04-28
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
Researcher credits:  Eldar 'HakuPiku' Zeynalli
CVE: CVE-2023-26451
CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Details:
oAuth provider uses predictable secret source, allows to take over any oAuth session. Functions with insufficient
randomness were used to generate authorization tokens of the integrated oAuth Authorization Service.

Risk:
Authorization codes were predictable for third parties and could be used to intercept and take over the client
authorization process. As a result, other users accounts could be compromised. The oAuth Authorization Service is not
enabled by default. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We have updated the implementation to use sources with sufficient randomness to generate authorization tokens.

CVSS: 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Details:
SQL Injection at Cacheservice "getObjects" API. The cacheservice API could be abused to inject parameters with SQL
syntax which was insufficiently sanitized before getting executed as SQL statement.

Risk:
Attackers with access to a local or restricted network were able to perform arbitrary SQL queries, discovering other
users cached data. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We have improved the input check for API calls and filter for potentially malicious content.

---

Internal reference: DOCS-4727

Details:
SQL Injection at Cacheservice "registerGroup" API. The cacheservice API could be abused to indirectly inject parameters
with SQL syntax which was insufficiently sanitized and would later be executed when creating new cache groups.

Risk:
Attackers with access to a local or restricted network could perform arbitrary SQL queries. No publicly available
exploits are known.

Solution:
We have improved the input check for API calls and filter for potentially malicious content.

Internal reference: DOCS-4728
Type: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
Component: office
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite office 8.10
First fixed revision: OX App Suite office 8.11
Discovery date: 2023-02-14
Solution date: 2023-04-28
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
Researcher credits: Mehmet 'mdisec' Ince
CVE: CVE-2023-26441
CVSS: 6.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)

Details:
Cacheservices allows local file inclusion/removal through directory traversal. Cacheservice did not correctly check if
relative cache object were pointing to the defined absolute location when accessing resources.

Risk:
An attacker with access to the database and a local or restricted network would be able to read arbitrary local file
system resources that are accessible by the services system user account. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We have improved path validation and make sure that any access is contained to the defined root directory.

---

Internal reference: DOCS-4734
Type: CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))
Component: office
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite office 8.10
First fixed revision: OX App Suite office 8.11
Discovery date: 2023-02-15
Disclosure date: 2023-08-02
Researcher credits: Mehmet 'mdisec' Ince
CVE: CVE-2023-26442
CVSS: 3.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Details:
Cacheservice HTTP client follow redirect responses, allowing SSRF. In case Cacheservice was configured to use a sproxyd
object-storage backend, it would follow HTTP redirects issued by that backend.

Risk:
An attacker with access to a local or restricted network with the capability to intercept and replay HTTP requests to
sproxyd (or who is in control of the sproxyd service) could perform a server-side request-forgery attack and make
Cacheservice connect to unexpected resources. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We have disabled the ability to follow HTTP redirects when connecting to sproxyd resources.

Release Notes for Patch Release #6230

MWB-1985 Not able to delete a user using option –no-reassign
Public task folders were not properly deleted in case no-reassign was set.
This has been solved by properly handling task folders in case no-reassign is set.

MWB-2091 Forward of multiple mails does not set the forwarded flag
Each message of a multiple mail forward is NOT marked as forwarded.
This has been fixed by marking each message of a multiple mails forward as forwarded.

MWB-2101 Unnecessary Data Retrieved from Filestore when Serving WebDAV Requests with
Range(s)
Unnecessary Data Retrieved from Filestore when Serving WebDAV Requests with Range(s).
This has been solved by forwarding requested range(s) to underlying filestore if possible.

MWB-2030 Guard Page Refresh for Guests on SSO Systems
Missing Set-Cookie directive when resolving share link under certain circumstances.
Orderly set session- and share-cookie when resolving share link to solve this issue.

MWB-2068 External account: [Connection security] stays ”StartTLS” when you tried to set
it as ”None”
Connect parameters not orderly parsed on mail account update.
This has been solved by orderly accepting connect parameters when updating a mail account’s at-
tributes.

OXUIB-2301 No file upload for Firefox browser under Android
Filepath was undefined instead of empty string.
This has been solved by making the check less specific. Sidenote: Firefox mobile is not officially
supported but it should work now.

MWB-2118 No Option to Prevent Creation of Guest Users with Specific Email Addresses
No option to prevent the creation of guest users with specific email addresses.
Introduced new property ”com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex” to allow additional checks
(SCR-1203).

MWB-2116 External POP accounts do not fetch mail anymore
IOException when using POP3 account. Some methods weren’t implemented, thus the Java inter-
nal object reference was used instead of the value stored in the object (the commands used for
communication to the POP3 server).
This has been solved by implementing toString() method of newly introduced appenders in Line-
LimitedBufferedReader along MWB-2048.

4 Changes relevant for Operators

4.1 Changes of Configuration Files

Change #SCR-1203 New property ”com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex”
In order to prevent the creation of guest users with certain email addresses, a new lean config-
uration property com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex is introduced. The property is
empty by default, reloadable and config-cascade aware.
It allows the definition of a regular expression pattern for email addresses of invited guest users. If
defined, the email address of newly invited named guest users must additionally match the pattern
(besides regular RFC 822 syntax checks, which are always performed), otherwise, the creation of
the guest user is denied. The pattern is used in a case-insensitive manner.
This may be used to prevent specific email address domains for guests, e.g. by defining a pattern
like
^((?!(?:@example\.com\s*$)|(?:@example\.org\s*$)).)*$
See https://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config/latest/#mode=search&term=com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex
for further details.

5 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.
