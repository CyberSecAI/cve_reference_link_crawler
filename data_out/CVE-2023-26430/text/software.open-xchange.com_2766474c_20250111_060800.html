Release Notes for Patch Release #6230

MWB-1985 Not able to delete a user using option –no-reassign
Public task folders were not properly deleted in case no-reassign was set.
This has been solved by properly handling task folders in case no-reassign is set.

Each message of a multiple mail forward is NOT marked as forwarded.
This has been fixed by marking each message of a multiple mails forward as forwarded.

Range(s)
Unnecessary Data Retrieved from Filestore when Serving WebDAV Requests with Range(s).
This has been solved by forwarding requested range(s) to underlying filestore if possible.

MWB-2030 Guard Page Refresh for Guests on SSO Systems
Missing Set-Cookie directive when resolving share link under certain circumstances.
Orderly set session- and share-cookie when resolving share link to solve this issue.

MWB-2068 External account: [Connection security] stays ”StartTLS” when you tried to set
it as ”None”
Connect parameters not orderly parsed on mail account update.
This has been solved by orderly accepting connect parameters when updating a mail account’s at-
tributes.

OXUIB-2301 No file upload for Firefox browser under Android
Filepath was undefined instead of empty string.
This has been solved by making the check less specific. Sidenote: Firefox mobile is not officially
supported but it should work now.

MWB-2118 No Option to Prevent Creation of Guest Users with Specific Email Addresses
No option to prevent the creation of guest users with specific email addresses.
Introduced new property ”com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex” to allow additional checks
(SCR-1203).

MWB-2116 External POP accounts do not fetch mail anymore
IOException when using POP3 account. Some methods weren’t implemented, thus the Java inter-
nal object reference was used instead of the value stored in the object (the commands used for
communication to the POP3 server).
This has been solved by implementing toString() method of newly introduced appenders in Line-
LimitedBufferedReader along MWB-2048.

4 Changes relevant for Operators

4.1 Changes of Configuration Files

Change #SCR-1203 New property ”com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex”
In order to prevent the creation of guest users with certain email addresses, a new lean config-
uration property com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex is introduced. The property is
empty by default, reloadable and config-cascade aware.
It allows the definition of a regular expression pattern for email addresses of invited guest users. If
defined, the email address of newly invited named guest users must additionally match the pattern
(besides regular RFC 822 syntax checks, which are always performed), otherwise, the creation of
the guest user is denied. The pattern is used in a case-insensitive manner.
This may be used to prevent specific email address domains for guests, e.g. by defining a pattern
like
^((?!(?:@example\.com\s*$)|(?:@example\.org\s*$)).)*$
See https://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config/latest/#mode=search&term=com.openexchange.share.guestEmailCheckRegex
for further details.

5 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.
