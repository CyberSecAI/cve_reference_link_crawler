Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35833:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `fsl-qdma` driver related to the queue command DMA. The driver uses `dma_alloc_coherent()` to allocate memory for the queue command DMA, but this memory is not freed in the remove function or the error handling path of `fsl_qdma_probe()`.
*   **Weakness:** The driver allocates memory with `dma_alloc_coherent()` without a corresponding free or managed deallocation, resulting in a memory leak.
*   **Impact:** The memory leak can cause the system to run out of memory over time.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by normal use of the `fsl-qdma` driver and does not require specific attacker capabilities.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** No specific attacker position is needed as the leak happens during the normal operation of the driver within the kernel.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix replaces `dma_alloc_coherent()` with `dmam_alloc_coherent()`. The `dmam_alloc_coherent` function is a managed version of memory allocation that ensures the allocated memory is automatically freed when the device is removed or on error during probe.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `b092529e0aa0` which added the qDMA controller driver for Layerscape SoCs.
*   The fix was introduced by commit `3aa58cb51318e329d203857f7a191678e60bb714`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes multiple commits that address this vulnerability, as the fix was backported to several stable kernel branches.
*   The Debian LTS advisory lists CVE-2024-35833 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the `linux-5.10` package update, indicating the fix was included in the 5.10 kernel line.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-35833 is a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `fsl-qdma` driver due to improper memory management with `dma_alloc_coherent()`. This issue is resolved by switching to `dmam_alloc_coherent()`, a managed memory allocation function that ensures memory is freed automatically. The vulnerability is triggered by normal use of the driver and can cause denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
