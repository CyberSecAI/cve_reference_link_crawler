In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fsl-qdma: Fix a memory leak related to the queue command DMA

This dma_alloc_coherent() is undone neither in the remove function, nor in
the error handling path of fsl_qdma_probe().

Switch to the managed version to fix both issues.
