Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-43825

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a relative path traversal issue in Shihonkanri Plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal:** The software does not properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to use relative paths to access files or directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious backup file. This file, when imported by a legitimate user, can lead to code execution due to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves a crafted backup file of the Shihonkanri Plus software.
*   The attacker needs to convince a legitimate user to import this specially crafted backup file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious backup file.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into importing the crafted file. This indicates a need for user interaction (UI: Required)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Shihonkanri Plus versions 9.0.3 and earlier.
*   The vendor, EKAKIN, has released version 9.1.0 and later to address this issue.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 5.3, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L, indicating the attack is local and requires user interaction.
*   The CVSS v2 score is 6.8, with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P, indicating the attack is over the network, with medium complexity, no authentication and partial impact.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Shimizu Yutaro of Cyber Defense Institute, Inc.
