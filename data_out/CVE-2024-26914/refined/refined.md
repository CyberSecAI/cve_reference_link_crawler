The provided content relates to a fix for an array overflow vulnerability in the AMD display driver within the Linux kernel, specifically in the `dcn32_fpu.c` file. This corresponds to CVE-2024-26914.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mpc_combines` array was incorrectly sized using `MAX_SURFACES`, which is defined per stream. However, the array is meant to record all planes per ASIC, which should use `MAX_PLANES`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Array overflow: Using `MAX_SURFACES` for `mpc_combines` array size leads to a buffer overflow when there are more than 3 planes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content does not explicitly state the impact of the overflow, but array overflows can lead to a variety of issues, including denial of service, memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the number of planes per ASIC exceeds the size allocated for `mpc_combines` array, which can happen during normal graphics operations if more than 3 planes are configured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to control the number of planes configured in the AMD display driver. This may be achieved through normal user-space interactions with the graphics system.
