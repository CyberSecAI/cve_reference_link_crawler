**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability present in the web management page of the affected PLANEX COMMUNICATIONS network devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The web management interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
