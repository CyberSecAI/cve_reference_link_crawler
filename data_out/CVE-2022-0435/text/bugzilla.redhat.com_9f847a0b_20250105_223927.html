| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2048738#c0)  Marian Rehak    2022-01-31 18:08:02 UTC  ``` A  remote stack overflow in the TIPC networking module. With FORTIFY_SOURCE's stricter memcpy() bounds checking, this can be exploited to cause remote DOS via kernel panic on systems using TIPC. Prior to these bounds checks, and with a canary leak (or no CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR), this can be exploited for RCE.
