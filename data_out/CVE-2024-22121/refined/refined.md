Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Zabbix Agent MSI installer allows a non-admin user to access the "Change" option via `msiexec.exe`. This bypasses the intended requirement for administrator privileges to modify the installed application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Preservation of Permissions (CWE-281):** The MSI installer does not properly enforce the required administrator privileges when the "Change" option is invoked through `msiexec.exe`. This allows non-administrative users to modify the application's installation.
- **Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels (CAPEC-180):** The access controls are not correctly configured, allowing a non-admin user to perform actions (like modifying the installation) that should be restricted to administrative users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Integrity Impact:** A non-admin user can change or remove important features of the Zabbix Agent, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior.
- **Availability Impact:** Removing critical components, like the Zabbix Agent Service, can render the application unusable and impact its availability.
-  Specifically, the described exploit allowed a non-admin user to remove the Zabbix Agent Service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine where the Zabbix Agent is installed.
- **MSI Installer:** The attack is launched by using the `msiexec.exe /i` command to access the "Change" option of the Zabbix Agent's MSI installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Non-Admin User Account:** The attacker must have a non-administrator user account on the target system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target machine.
- **Knowledge of MSI Command:** The attacker must know how to use the `msiexec.exe /i` command to access the installer's "Change" option.

**Summary of Findings:**

The vulnerability allows a non-admin user to modify the Zabbix Agent installation by exploiting a lack of proper permission enforcement in the MSI installer. This can lead to the removal of key components, impacting the agent's integrity and availability. The attack vector is local, using the `msiexec.exe` command.
