*  The severity is considered low and unlikely to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email that contains a crafted request targeting the vulnerable plugin.
*   If a logged-in user visits this page or clicks on the malicious link while authenticated, their browser will unknowingly send the malicious request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
*   The attacker must be able to lure a logged-in user into interacting with the crafted malicious content.
