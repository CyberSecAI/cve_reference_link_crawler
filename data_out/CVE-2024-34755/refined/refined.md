- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Integration for Contact Form 7 and Salesforce plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious request and tricking a logged-in user to execute it (e.g., through a link or embedded content), an attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into interacting with a malicious request. They do not need prior authentication to the WordPress site itself.
