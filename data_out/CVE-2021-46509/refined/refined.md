- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow occurs due to an issue in the `snquote` function when processing a crafted JSON string, specifically within the `mjs_json.c` file at line 102.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion or excessive stack allocation within the `snquote` function during JSON string processing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Crash of the application due to stack overflow, potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:  Crafted JavaScript code containing nested or complex JSON structures can trigger the vulnerability when processed by the `mjs` engine. The specific code `(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]))((JSON.parse - 6.5 - 321e2)(JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3])));` shows how to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable `mjs` environment.
