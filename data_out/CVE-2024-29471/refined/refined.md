Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple areas, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when other users access the affected pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation in the following areas:
    - Category List (Lab -> Category List)
    - Friendly Links management
    - Notice management
    - Privilege management
    - Role Management under privilege
    - User List under user management
- The application stores user provided data without encoding it for safe output in HTML context, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User information theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information like user account passwords and cookies.
- **Session hijacking:** Attackers can bypass authentication using stolen cookies, gaining unauthorized access and control.
- **Malicious redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites for phishing or malware installation.
- **Website tampering:** Attackers can modify webpage content to deceive users or spread malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to log in to the system (with default credentials "root/123456" according to the report, this is a significant issue in itself.)
- The attacker then injects malicious JavaScript into fields related to the identified vulnerable areas.
- When other users access the pages, the stored malicious scripts will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account (or be able to use the default credentials) to log in to the backend administrative interface of the OneBlog application.
- Basic knowledge of XSS attacks is required.
- No special network position or capabilities needed, other than the ability to access the affected web application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text also mentions two SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerabilities in the application related to adding friendly links and the article porter function. However, the provided information primarily focuses on the six XSS vulnerabilities.
- The identified XSS vulnerabilities are stored XSS, meaning the malicious scripts are permanently stored in the application's database. This leads to the scripts being executed whenever a user visits the affected page, making the impact more severe.
- The report indicates that the identified vulnerabilities are in OneBlog version 2.3.4.
- The report indicates that the content is only available to repository contributors which might mean the exploit details are not yet publicly disclosed.
- The issue report also mentions default credentials, which is not directly related to the XSS or SSRF vulnerabilities.
