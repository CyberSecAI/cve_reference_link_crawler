The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing null check for the 'afb' variable in the `amdgpu_dm_update_cursor` function within the AMD display driver. The code assumed that 'afb' would always be valid, but it could potentially be null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference. If 'afb' is null, accessing `afb->base.pitches[0]` or `afb->base.format->cpp[0]` will lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service:** The most likely impact is a kernel crash and denial of service. The system would become unstable and potentially require a reboot.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered within the AMD display driver when updating the cursor. Specific conditions that lead to a null 'afb' are not detailed but it is related to display operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   An attacker would need to be able to trigger the `amdgpu_dm_update_cursor` function in a way that results in 'afb' being null. This likely requires the ability to interact with display hardware.
-   The attacker needs to be running on a system with an affected AMD GPU and driver.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a null check `if (afb)` before attempting to access `afb->base.pitches[0]` and `afb->base.format->cpp[0]`.
- The fix was implemented in the commit [0fe20258b4989b9112b5e9470df33a0939403fd4](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=0fe20258b4989b9112b5e9470df33a0939403fd4) which was backported with commit [a742168b6a39ead257da53bcbe472384d6e14a1b](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=a742168b6a39ead257da53bcbe472384d6e14a1b)
