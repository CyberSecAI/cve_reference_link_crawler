The provided content describes a vulnerability related to bypassing Code Owners branch protection in GitLab.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Git's ambiguous ref name resolution, where a tag with the same name as a protected branch can take precedence over the branch when evaluating Code Owners rules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Git's ambiguous ref resolution gives precedence to tags over branches, when they share the same name.
- GitLab's Code Owners implementation uses the ambiguous ref name, making it vulnerable to this precedence.
- Branch protection can be bypassed, allowing unapproved merges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Developer role can bypass Code Owners approval and merge malicious code into a protected branch.
- This can compromise the integrity of the source code, enabling attackers to introduce backdoors, steal secrets, or conduct supply chain attacks.
- No user interaction from the maintainer is required.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have developer access to a repository.
- The attacker creates a tag with the same name as the protected branch.
- The attacker creates a branch with malicious code and merges it into the protected branch without code owner approval.
- The attacker can delete the tag afterward to cover their tracks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Developer access to the target repository.
- Ability to create tags and branches.
- Ability to push to the repository.
