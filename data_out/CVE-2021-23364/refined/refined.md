Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-23364:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly references CVE-2021-23364 and describes a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `browserslist` package. All provided content confirms this CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a set of regular expressions used in `browserslist` to parse queries. Specifically, the regex pattern `\d*\.?\d+` was vulnerable to ReDoS.
   - The vulnerable regex is used in the `cover` and `since` queries for parsing version numbers.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
    - The core weakness is the use of an inefficient regular expression `\d*\.?\d+` that can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing maliciously crafted input.
    - Specifically, the use of `*` and `?` quantifiers in the regular expression can cause the regex engine to try numerous combinations and consume excessive processing time.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - A successful ReDoS attack can cause a denial of service. By providing a specially crafted input string, an attacker can cause the `browserslist` library to hang or consume excessive CPU resources, making the system or application unresponsive.
    - This could lead to application downtime or resource exhaustion.

**5. Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through providing a specially crafted string as an input query to the `browserslist` library. This can happen in various ways, depending on how `browserslist` is used (e.g., command-line arguments, user-provided configurations, etc.).

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input strings passed to the `browserslist` library. They do not need any special privileges or access to the system.
    - The attacker can be a remote user if the system using the `browserslist` library is accessible over the network and allows external input.

**Additional Details:**

- **Fix Strategy:** The fix for this vulnerability involves replacing `\d*\.?\d+` with `\d+|\d*\.\d+`.
- **Affected Versions:**  All versions of `browserslist` prior to 4.16.5 are affected by this vulnerability.
- **Proof of Concept:** A proof of concept (PoC) code is provided demonstrating how a large number of "1"s can cause excessive processing time and lead to the vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.3 (Medium).
