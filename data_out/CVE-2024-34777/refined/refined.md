Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-34777**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `map_benchmark_ioctl()` function within the Linux kernel's DMA mapping benchmark code. Specifically, the code was not properly validating node IDs before using them to check if a node is possible using `node_possible()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The code did not check if the provided node ID was within the valid range [0, MAX_NUMNODES - 1] before passing it to `node_possible()`. This function expects a valid node ID and can lead to out-of-bounds access if supplied with an invalid one.
- Out-of-bounds access: Passing an invalid node ID to `node_possible()` can cause the function to read memory outside of its allocated bounds, resulting in a wild-memory-access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The out-of-bounds read can lead to a kernel crash, as demonstrated by the KASAN report included in the commit messages.
- Denial of service: A kernel crash results in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `map_benchmark_ioctl()` function, which is accessible through a debugfs file. An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by sending an ioctl command with a crafted node ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the debugfs file system, allowing them to interact with the `map_benchmark_ioctl()` function.
- Ability to execute ioctl commands on this file.

**Technical Details:**
The fix introduces a check `(map->bparam.node < 0 || map->bparam.node >= MAX_NUMNODES)` before calling `node_possible()`. This ensures that the node ID is within a valid range or equals `NUMA_NO_NODE`.

The original code:
```c
if (map->bparam.node != NUMA_NO_NODE &&
    !node_possible(map->bparam.node)) {
```

The corrected code:
```c
if (map->bparam.node != NUMA_NO_NODE &&
    (map->bparam.node < 0 || map->bparam.node >= MAX_NUMNODES ||
    !node_possible(map->bparam.node))) {
```
This patch ensures that an out of bounds access is prevented before calling `node_possible()`.
