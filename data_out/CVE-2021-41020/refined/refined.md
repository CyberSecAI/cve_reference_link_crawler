- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control. An authenticated, non-privileged attacker can access the regeneration URL, which is intended for privileged users only.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper access control (CWE-284).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can regenerate the CA certificate, potentially disrupting service or gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: By accessing a specific URL (regeneration URL).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with non-privileged access to the FortiIsolator system.
