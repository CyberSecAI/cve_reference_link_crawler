The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48670.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the `adev_release()` function within the `drivers/peci/cpu.c` file of the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `adev_release()` function incorrectly calls `auxiliary_device_uninit()`. This occurs because when `auxiliary_device_add()` returns an error, `auxiliary_device_uninit()` is called, which decrements the device's refcount, triggering the `.release` callback which in turn calls `adev_release()`. Then, `adev_release()` also calls `auxiliary_device_uninit()`, leading to a double free and use-after-free scenario.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a variety of impacts, including but not limited to, system instability, crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `auxiliary_device_add()` function fails. This can be triggered by actions leading to device initialization errors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to trigger the failure of the `auxiliary_device_add()` function. The exact circumstances required to trigger this failure and whether it is achievable by a user without elevated privileges is not discussed within the provided content.
