The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48808.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a race condition during the shutdown process of a DSA (Distributed Switch Architecture) master device. When the DSA master device unregisters, it triggers a `dev_close()` event, which is notified to `dsa_slave_netdevice_event()`. However, if `dsa_switch_shutdown()` has already run and unregistered the DSA slave interfaces, the `NETDEV_GOING_DOWN` handler attempts to call `dev_close_many()` on those slave interfaces, leading to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition during shutdown: The DSA master device unregistration and the DSA switch shutdown sequence are not properly synchronized, resulting in the `NETDEV_GOING_DOWN` handler attempting to access already unregistered slave interfaces.
- Improper handling of `NETDEV_GOING_DOWN` events after `dsa_switch_shutdown()`: The handler was attempting to unregister the slave interfaces which was not the correct solution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: The vulnerability leads to a kernel panic, causing a system crash and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- System reboot: The panic is triggered during system reboot or shutdown when the DSA master device is being unregistered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trigger a system reboot or shutdown while the DSA master device (e.g. `dpaa2-eth` in the example) is up. This could be done through legitimate system management interfaces or potentially by other vulnerabilities that allow a system shutdown.
