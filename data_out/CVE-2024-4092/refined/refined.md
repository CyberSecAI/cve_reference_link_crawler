### CVE-2024-4092

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `htmltag` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the website
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Data theft
*   Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
An authenticated user with author or higher privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the `htmltag` parameter. The injected code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have author or higher privileges on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to access the Slider Revolution plugin settings.
