Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` POST parameter in the `ajax.php?action=delete_tenant` endpoint. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The system directly incorporates user-supplied data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query, potentially leading to:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data from the database.
    - **Unauthorized Access:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms or escalating privileges.
    - **Denial of Service:** Disrupting the normal operation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/rental/ajax.php?action=delete_tenant` endpoint.
- The malicious SQL injection is placed within the `id` parameter of the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No special user role is required, the vulnerability is accessible to anyone who can send a POST request to the specific URL.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `ajax.php` when the `action` is `delete_tenant`.
- The code directly uses the `id` parameter from the POST request in a SQL query without any input validation or sanitization.
- An example of a malicious request is provided: `id=4+and+sleep(3)--+`, where `sleep(3)` is used as a proof of concept to demonstrate that SQL injection is possible.
