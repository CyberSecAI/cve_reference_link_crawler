Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28147:

**CVE-2022-28147**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin (versions 2.3 and earlier)
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check in a form validation method.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can check for the existence of an arbitrary file path on the Jenkins controller file system. This could allow an attacker to discover information about the server's environment and potentially be used as a stepping stone for further attacks.
*   **Technical Details:** The plugin has a form validation method that allows checking for the existence of a file path. This method does not check for necessary permissions before performing the check.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4 of the Continuous Integration with Toad Edge Plugin by requiring Overall/Administer permission for the form validation method.
