- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper copy algorithm and component validation in the project upload mechanism. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how B&R Automation Studio handles manipulated project information during project upload from a target PLC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper validation of project files during upload. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content that is executed within the security context of Automation Studio.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service on the system running B&R Automation Studio.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Manipulating stored project information on a PLC that has not been sufficiently secured.
    -  Using spoofing techniques to make B&R Automation Studio connect to an attacker-controlled device with manipulated project files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to either have access to a vulnerable PLC or be able to spoof one.
    - The attacker needs to be able to manipulate project files that are then uploaded to the Automation Studio.
