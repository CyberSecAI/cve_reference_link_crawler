- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited by a subscriber (or lower privileged user) by interacting with the vulnerable function. The specific vector depends on the vulnerable function but generally involves making requests or calls to the function without appropriate authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber or have a lower privileged user account.
