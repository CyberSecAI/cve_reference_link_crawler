Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function of the Tenda AC7 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure `sscanf` usage:** The `save_staticroute_data` function uses `sscanf` with a format string `%[^,],%[^,],%[^,],%s` to parse user-provided data. This format is greedy and doesn't limit the amount of data read into the `dst_net`, `net_mask`, `net_gw`, and `net_ifname` buffers, leading to a potential overflow if the input data exceeds the buffer sizes.
- **Lack of input validation:** The firmware does not properly validate the size of the `list` parameter received via a POST request before passing it to `save_staticroute_data`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stack Overflow:** By sending a specially crafted `list` parameter with excessive data, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` endpoint with a malicious `list` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This typically requires the attacker to be on the same network as the router, or have network access to the router.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided description, but exploitation may require access to an authenticated session or might be possible without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware version is Tenda AC7V1.0 V15.03.06.44.
- The vulnerable function is `fromSetRouteStatic`, which calls `save_staticroute_data`.
- A Proof-of-Concept (POC) exploit using a Python script is provided, which demonstrates the exploitation by sending a long string as the `list` parameter.
