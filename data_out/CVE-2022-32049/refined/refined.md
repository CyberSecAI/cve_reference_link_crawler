- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FUN_00418540` function in `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` copies the value of the `url` JSON parameter to local stack variables without proper length validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to lack of length check on user-provided input (`url` parameter).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON request to `/web_cste/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with an overly long `url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
