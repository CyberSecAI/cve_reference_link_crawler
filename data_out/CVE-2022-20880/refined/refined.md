- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers. Specifically, the vulnerabilities are related to buffer overflows (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with *root*-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device and network access to the web interface.
