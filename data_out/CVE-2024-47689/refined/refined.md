Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-47689**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the bug is that the f2fs filesystem sets the SB_RDONLY flag in the `f2fs_handle_critical_error` function, which is an internal function, instead of setting it during the remount procedure using the `sb->s_umount` semaphore. This creates a race condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race condition: The `SB_RDONLY` flag is set in a critical error handler, which bypasses the standard remount process. This can lead to a race with other superblock operations.
- Incorrect flag handling: The `SB_RDONLY` flag is set directly, instead of being set through the proper remount procedure. This creates inconsistencies and can lead to deadlocks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Deadlocks: The race condition can lead to deadlocks in the kernel, causing a denial of service.
- Kernel Panic: The provided syzbot report shows a warning at `kernel/rcu/sync.c:177` leading to a potential kernel panic.
- Filesystem inconsistency: Incorrect setting of `SB_RDONLY` can create inconsistencies between actual filesystem state and what the kernel expects

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a critical error in the f2fs filesystem while other operations (such as freezing/thawing) are in progress. This can be achieved through various filesystem corruption scenarios.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to trigger a critical error in the f2fs filesystem that will cause the filesystem to attempt to remount itself read-only. This could be achieved via a malicious process performing write operations that corrupt the filesystem or via direct access to the underlying block device.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix removes setting the `SB_RDONLY` flag in `f2fs_handle_critical_error` and relies on the `CP_ERROR_FLAG` which stops any further updates to the filesystem once set. This aligns f2fs with how ext4 handles errors.
- The provided commits are all identical, pointing to the same fix being applied across different branches
