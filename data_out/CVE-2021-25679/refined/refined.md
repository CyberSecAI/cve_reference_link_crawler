Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-25679

**Description:** The AdTran Personal Phone Manager software is vulnerable to an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input in the "emailAddress" and "emailAddress2" POST parameters within the `/userapp/userSettingsAction.html` form. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code that is then rendered by the application without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, enabling the storage of malicious scripts within the application's data store which are then executed in the context of other user's browsers when viewed.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack another user's session, gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.
*   **Configuration Modification:** An attacker could modify a user's configuration settings.
*   **Data Capture (Keylogging):** An attacker could use XSS payloads to capture user input, including sensitive information like keystrokes.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting and executing javascript, an attacker can redirect, change UI, and exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through a web form located at `<https://example.com/userapp/userSettingsAction.html>`.
*   **POST Request:** The malicious payload is submitted via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the vulnerable form. This means the attacker must have an account on the Adtran Personal Phone Manager application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Payload Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious XSS payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameters:**  `emailAddress` and `emailAddress2` in the POST request to `/userapp/userSettingsAction.html`
*   **Example Payload:** A basic payload `data"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` can be used in the `emailAddress` parameter to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Confirmed on version 10.8.1 and potentially other versions before this.

**Mitigation:**
The recommended mitigation is to sanitize user-controlled input in the vulnerable form fields and URL parameters, encoding data to prevent it from being rendered as arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.

**Additional Notes**

* The affected devices (NetVanta 7060 and NetVanta 7100) are End-of-Life, and no patches will be released. Users are advised to upgrade to a supported appliance.
* The vulnerability was discovered on 1/21/2021, and full disclosure was made on 4/17/2021.
