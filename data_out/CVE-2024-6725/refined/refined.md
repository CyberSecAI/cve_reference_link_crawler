Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6725

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Formidable Forms plugin. Specifically, the 'html' parameter is not properly handled, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages.
- This code executes whenever a user accesses the infected page, which can lead to various malicious actions.
- Potential impacts could include:
   - Session hijacking/cookie theft
   - Defacement of the website
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Stealing sensitive user information
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated attackers, with form editing permissions and at least Subscriber-level access can inject malicious scripts via the 'html' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least "Subscriber" level permissions (or higher) with the ability to edit forms.
- The attacker must be able to access the form editing functionality of the plugin and manipulate the 'html' parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Formidable Forms plugin up to and including 6.11.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.11.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the researcher "zer0gh0st."
- The vulnerable code is located in `classes/models/fields/FrmFieldType.php` file, which handles how fields are created and rendered in the forms.
