- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when clearing logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into clearing logs without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file that, when opened by a logged-in admin, sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, triggering the log clearing action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in administrator to open a malicious HTML file.
