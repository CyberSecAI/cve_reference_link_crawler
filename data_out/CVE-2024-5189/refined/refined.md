Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and output escaping of the `custom_js` parameter within the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin. This allows users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it does not sanitize user-supplied JavaScript code before saving it to the database and then outputting it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected pages.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Attackers can potentially perform actions on behalf of other users, including administrators, leading to full site compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  The injected scripts could redirect users to malicious websites or force them to download malware.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via the 'custom_js' parameter which can be modified by authenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor+ Role:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access (or higher) to be able to modify the affected setting.

**Technical Details (from provided content):**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `Asset_Builder.php` file, specifically where the `custom_js` is outputted inline to the page.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.9.24 of the plugin by restricting the ability to add/edit custom JS to administrators only and also by sanitizing the input.
*   The `Custom_JS.php` file was modified to restrict access based on user role and include a warning for non-administrators.

**Summary of Changes in the Fix (5.9.24):**

*   **Role Restriction:**  The ability to add or edit custom JavaScript is restricted to users with the 'administrator' role.
*   **Warning Message:** A warning message is displayed to non-administrator users in the Custom JS settings.
*   **Input Sanitization:** The provided code does not show explicit input sanitization, but it is mentioned as a fix in the release notes.
