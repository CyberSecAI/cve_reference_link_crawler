### Description

The Folders and Folders Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 3.0 in Folders and 3.0.2 in Folders Pro via the 'handle\_folders\_file\_upload' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and above, to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server.
