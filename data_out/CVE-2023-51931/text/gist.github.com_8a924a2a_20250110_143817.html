|  | A regex defined on line 1. inside https://github.com/alanclarke/urlite/blob/master/lib/pattern.js inside npm package "Urlite" |
| --- | --- |
|  | (https://www.npmjs.com/package/urlite) is found to be vulnerable to Regex Denial of Service when malicious input containing a long regex input is |
|  | provided to the application that parses a URL. When a malicious payload is provided to the parsing |
|  | function the application will hang for indefinite amount of time causing Denial of Service. |
|  | If more requests are sent using the same payload it can result in |
|  | Distributed Denial of service potentially rendering the service unavailable. |
|  |  |
|  | Payload that was used: |
|  |  |
|  | var payload ='//:' + '\t:\t'.repeat(90000)+ '\t' |
|  | var parsed = urlite.parse(payload) |
|  |  |
|  | This will cause 17 second delay for the function to process the input. |
|  | This can be increased since there is no limit on the input length |
