### **[6en6ar](/6en6ar)** commented [Jan 22, 2024](#issue-2094790591)

| The regex inside lib/pattern.js file seems to be vulnerable to Regex denial of service. I used this payload to cause a 17 second delay when a URL is processed by the parse() function. Maybe it can be even longer, probably depends on the length.  **'//:' + '\t:\t'.repeat(90000)+ '\t'** |
