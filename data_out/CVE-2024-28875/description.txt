A security flaw involving hard-coded credentials in LevelOne WBR-6012's web services allows attackers to gain unauthorized access during the first 30 seconds post-boot. Other vulnerabilities can force a reboot, circumventing the initial time restriction for exploitation.The backdoor string can be found at address 0x80100910

    80100910 40 6d 21 74        ds         "@m!t2K1"
             32 4b 31 00
             
It is referenced by the function located at 0x800b78b0 and is used as shown in the pseudocode below:

    if ((SECOND_FROM_BOOT_TIME < 300) &&
        (is_equal = strcmp(password,"@m!t2K1")) {
            return 1;}
            
Where 1 is the return value to admin-level access (0 being fail and 3 being user).
