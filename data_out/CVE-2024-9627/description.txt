The TeploBot - Telegram Bot for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure due to missing authorization checks on the 'service_process' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view the Telegram Bot Token, which is a secret token to control the bot.
