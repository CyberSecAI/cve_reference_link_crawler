Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14893:

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-14893 is one of many vulnerabilities affecting MySQL, as identified in the provided Gentoo and NetApp security advisories. While specific details about this CVE are not provided in the text, the advisory highlights the potential impact and general nature of the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The provided texts do not specify the root cause of CVE-2020-14893

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The advisories mention multiple vulnerabilities affecting various versions of MySQL.
- The nature of the vulnerability is not described, but it is likely related to an error in the code of MySQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, escalate privileges, gain access to critical data, or cause a Denial of Service condition.
- Specifically, for the products affected by the advisory, the impact includes: unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to MySQL server data, or a hang or crash of MySQL Server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), suggesting that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Other vectors may exist, but they are not described in these advisories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The NetApp advisory specifies a medium-severity CVSS score of 4.9 for CVE-2020-14893 with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`, meaning an attacker needs high privileges (`PR:H`) to exploit the vulnerability and no user interaction is needed (`UI:N`). The attack is performed over the network (`AV:N`) with low complexity (`AC:L`), resulting in a high availability impact (`A:H`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The Gentoo advisory references multiple CVEs affecting MySQL, but it does not give specific details for each one. It focuses on the need to upgrade MySQL to the latest version.
- The NetApp advisory lists CVE-2020-14893 among many other CVEs, affecting multiple NetApp products that incorporate Oracle MySQL.
- The NetApp advisory also provides remediation steps, software versions, and affected product lists, which is very helpful to mitigate this issue.
- It's important to note that both advisories are related to the same set of vulnerabilities in MySQL.
