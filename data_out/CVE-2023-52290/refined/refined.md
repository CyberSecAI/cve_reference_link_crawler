```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The sort field used in SQL queries for list pages in the Apache StreamPark console is not validated, allowing for arbitrary SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation on sort fields.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Data leakage may occur due to successful SQL injection. No data will be written, hence the impact is considered low.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user manipulates the sort field in list pages (e.g., application pages) via the front-end, which is then used to generate the SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be successfully logged into the system to exploit the vulnerability."
