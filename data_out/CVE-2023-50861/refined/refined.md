- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HUSKY plugin for WordPress versions <= 1.3.4.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website to execute the unwanted action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to induce a logged-in user into taking an action that triggers the CSRF vulnerability.
