- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs when handling XML data provided to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected D-Link DAP-1325 router.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can send specially crafted XML data to the HNAP1 SOAP endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
