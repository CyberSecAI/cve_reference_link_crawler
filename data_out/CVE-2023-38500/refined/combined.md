# TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-002: By-passing Cross-Site Scripting Protection in HTML Sanitizer

Categories:
[Development](/help/security-advisories/development "Development"),

[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Oliver Hader

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

* **Component Type:** TYPO3 CMS
* **Subcomponent:** HTML Sanitizer (based on [typo3/html-sanitizer](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer))
* **Release Date:** July 25, 2023
* **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting
* **Affected Versions:** 8.7.42-8.7.52, 9.5.29-9.5.41, 10.4.19-10.4.38, 11.3.2-11.5.29, 12.0.0-12.4.3
* **Severity:** Medium
* **Suggested CVSS:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
* **References:** [CVE-2023-38500](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38500), [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

### Problem Description

Due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a *noscript* element was not encoded correctly. *noscript* is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of [*typo3/html-sanitizer*](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer).

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.53 ELTS, 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30, 12.4.4 that fix the problem described above.

### Credits

Thanks to David Klein and Yaniv Nizry who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.

### General Advice

Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/Security/Index.html#security). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) mailing list.

### General Note

All security related code changes are tagged so that you can easily look them up in our [review system](https://review.typo3.org/#/q/status:merged+project:Packages/TYPO3.CMS+topic:security,n,z).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* [SECURITY] Properly encode noscript child nodes

The `<noscript>` element has a special behavior when
being evaluated in browsers, which depends on whether
script-parsing is enabled or disabled.

As a consequence this change will

* encode comment inner data, e.g. `<!-- <"comment"> -->`
  as `<!-- &lt;&quot;comment&quot;&gt -->`
* always encode tag attributes, e.g. `<p id="<value>">`
  as `<p id="&lt;value&gt;">`
* extend `Comment` and `CdataSection` to have a constructor
  (which triggers encoding per default) and to implement the
  `Behavior\HandlerInterface`
* add a new serializer option `encode_attributes`, which might
  basically be extracted to `Masterminds\HTML5`

* [TASK] Ensure attribute serialization preserves values as is

We don't want so called double-encoding – which is a valid
usecase when HTML describes how HTML is to be written – to
be automagically transformed to single encoded values,
as otherwise a valid input like

<a title="Insert &amp;amp; to write an &amp;"></a>
(Browser would show "Insert &amp; to write an &")

…would be changed to:

<a title="Insert &amp; to write an &amp;"></a>
(Browser would show "Insert & to write an &")

Also add tests for the attribute encoding we want:
 * Encode quotes, tags and stuff that might cause security issues
 * do not encode unnecessarily encode slashes or colons
   (like htmlentitites would do)
