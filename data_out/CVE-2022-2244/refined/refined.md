Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2244 (Based on the file name CVE-2022-2244.json, although the content doesn't explicitly mention the CVE ID, it's related to the vulnerability described in the report)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in GitLab's Sentry error tracking integration. Specifically, when a user requests details about a Sentry error, GitLab directly uses the issue ID provided in the URL without verifying if the issue belongs to the Sentry project configured for the GitLab project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system relies on the user-supplied `ID` parameter in the URL to fetch details about Sentry issues without proper authorization checks.
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** There's a lack of verification to ensure the requested Sentry issue belongs to the configured Sentry project within GitLab.
- **Integrity Issue:** Users with `Reporter` role in GitLab can resolve and ignore Sentry issues via the GitLab UI, which affects the state of the issues in Sentry. This suggests that `Reporter` role has an unexpected level of access to the error tracking feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can enumerate issues from all Sentry projects that the maintainer of the GitLab project has access to. This includes potentially sensitive information such as stack traces from source code.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker can also resolve and ignore issues in the connected Sentry project, impacting the integrity of the error tracking data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker navigates to the `/-/error_tracking` page within a GitLab project.
- The attacker obtains a valid Sentry issue ID from the Sentry system.
- The attacker manually modifies the URL, specifically the `/ID/details` portion, to include the issue ID from another project that the configured Sentry user has access to.
- The attacker loads the modified URL, causing GitLab to fetch and display details of the issue in the attackerâ€™s browser, regardless of the issue's association with the project configured in GitLab.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be at least a `Reporter` in the GitLab project to access the error tracking feature.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the Sentry server's URL and a valid Sentry issue ID that belongs to any Sentry project the configured Sentry user has access to.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
- The provided content offers extensive details regarding the nature of the vulnerability, how to reproduce the exploit, and its potential impact. It identifies the vulnerability as an IDOR, along with the lack of proper authorization checks, and also outlines the integrity impact of being able to resolve and ignore issues.
- It gives specific steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- It mentions that self-hosted Sentry instances are more vulnerable due to the smaller number of issues, which increases the probability of finding accessible issue IDs.
- The report also raises a concern about the permissions granted to the `Reporter` role, which allows modification of Sentry data.
