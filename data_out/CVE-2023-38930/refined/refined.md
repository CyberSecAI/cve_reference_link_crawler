Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `addWifiMacFilter` function within the `httpd` binary of Tenda routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to copy user-provided data (`deviceId`) into a fixed-size stack buffer (`mib_value`) without any length checks. This can lead to overwriting the stack if the input `deviceId` is larger than the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the device to crash by overflowing the buffer.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With carefully crafted input, an attacker might be able to overwrite the return address on the stack, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP request to the `/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint. The attacker needs to control the `deviceId` parameter within this request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tenda router, likely on the same network.
- **Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `deviceId` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects a range of Tenda router models and firmware versions as specified in the document.
- The `sprintf` function is used to copy the `deviceId` parameter into the `mib_value` buffer.
- No length checks are performed before the copy operation, leading to the overflow.
