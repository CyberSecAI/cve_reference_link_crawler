#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Go to <server>/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiUserProfileSheet?action=disable&userId=XWiki.Admin&csrf=<token> where <token> is the CSRF token (can be found in the data-xwiki-form-token attribute of the <html> element).
2. Log in as the admin user.

**Expected result:**

In the first step, false is displayed and in the second step, the admin user can be normally used.

**Actual result:**

In the first step, true is displayed and in the second step, the admin user gets the message "Your account has been disabled. Please contact the administrator if you think this is a mistake.".

By replacing disable by enable in the first step, the account can be re-enabled. This has two consequences:

1. The wiki can be sabotaged by disabling all users.
2. Disabled users can easily re-enable themselves, at least on wikis that aren't private, I haven't checked if a logged-in user on a private wiki can also re-enable himself.

It is not clear to me if the rights check should have been in the user profile or in the user script server which is why I've added both components.

# Missing Authorization to enable or disable users in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-user-profile-ui

High

[surli](/surli)

GHSA-p5v9-g8w8-5q4v
Nov 21, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-user-profile-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 12.4

## Patched versions

14.5RC1, 14.4.2, 13.10.7

## Description

### Impact

Any user (logged in or not) with access to the page XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet can enable or disable any user profile. This might allow to a disabled user to re-enable themselves, or to an attacker to disable any user of the wiki.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.7, 14.5RC1 and 14.4.2.

### Workarounds

The problem can be patched immediately by editing the page `XWiki.XWikiUserProfileSheet` in the wiki and by performing the changes contained in [5be1cc0](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5be1cc0adf917bf10899c47723fa451e950271fa).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
