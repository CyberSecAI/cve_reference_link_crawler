Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6969

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing validation on a user-controlled key within the `user_meta` shortcode in the User Shortcodes Plus plugin. This allows an attacker to specify any user meta key and retrieve its value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses a user-supplied key to retrieve user meta without proper authorization or sanitization, allowing access to potentially sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Authenticated attackers can retrieve sensitive user metadata that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `user_meta` shortcode.
*   Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least contributor-level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with Contributor level access or higher on the WordPress site.
*   They must be able to insert and execute shortcodes, which is a standard capability for Contributor users.
