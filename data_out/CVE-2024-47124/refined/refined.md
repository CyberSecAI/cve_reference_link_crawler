Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The goTenna Pro App transmits callsigns in cleartext within messages. This means that the callsign information is not encrypted and can be intercepted by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information: The callsign, which could contain sensitive information, is sent without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Loss of Confidentiality: Attackers can eavesdrop on communications and potentially gain access to sensitive information included in the callsigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent Network: An attacker within radio range of the goTenna Pro devices can intercept the cleartext callsigns being transmitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within radio range of the affected goTenna Pro devices.
- The attacker needs to be able to capture the radio transmissions to intercept the cleartext callsigns.
