Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-42328 and CVE-2022-42329:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Xen network backend driver (`xen-netback`) in the Linux kernel was not using the correct function to free packet buffers (SKBs) in certain scenarios. Specifically, a previous patch for XSA-392 introduced a situation where `kfree_skb()` was called with interrupts disabled, which is not allowed, leading to a deadlock.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**

*   **Incorrect Memory Management:** The driver was attempting to free network packet buffers using `kfree_skb()` while interrupts were disabled or from a hardware interrupt context. This could result in a deadlock.
*   **Race Condition:** When dropping packages due to full queues or other reasons while `netpoll` is active, the same deadlock could occur. `netpoll` is used for debugging purposes or when the system has crashed and does not handle this situation well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious Xen guest can trigger a deadlock in the host's network backend driver, causing the host to hang, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Xen Guest:** A malicious guest can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to control a Xen guest, enabling them to send crafted network packets to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by normal network traffic conditions as well.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVE-2022-42328:** Specifically relates to the incorrect use of `kfree_skb` after XSA-392 changes when the driver drops a packet due to queue length limits.
*   **CVE-2022-42329:** Occurs when `netpoll` is active and packets are dropped for reasons other than queue limits, the same issue can cause a deadlock due to the incorrect `kfree_skb()` usage.
*   The fix involves removing the direct call to `kfree_skb` within the interrupt-disabled section. Instead, the driver now uses the existing "drop" path in `xenvif_start_xmit()` to free the buffer using `dev_kfree_skb_any()`, which is safe to use with disabled interrupts.

The provided text contains a discussion about whether `rx_dropped` or `tx_dropped` should be incremented in certain scenarios. This is related to the fix, but not the vulnerability itself, therefore it is not included in the summary.
