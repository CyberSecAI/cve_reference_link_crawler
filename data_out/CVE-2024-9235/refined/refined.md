Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient capability check in the `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function within the Mapster WP Maps plugin. This function allows for updating arbitrary options on the WordPress site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that the `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function lacks proper authorization checks. It only verifies if the user has `edit_posts` capability, which is granted to Contributor-level users and above and is not enough to protect options from modification.
*   **Arbitrary Options Update:** Due to the lack of proper authorization, an attacker can manipulate the `option_name` parameter to update any option within the WordPress database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A contributor-level attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to administrator by manipulating the `default_role` option and enabling user registration. This allows them to gain full control over the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Complete Site Takeover:**  By gaining administrative access, the attacker can further manipulate the website, install malicious plugins, inject code, and steal data, potentially leading to complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based and can be performed remotely.
*   **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exposed through a REST API endpoint provided by the plugin. The `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function is registered as a callback for the `mapster-wp-maps/set-option` endpoint.
*  **Request Parameters:** An attacker can use `GET` request method, and modify `option_name` and `option_value` parameters to update WordPress options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access or higher (as they have `edit_posts` capability).
*   **Access to the REST API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint exposed by the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.0 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.0.
*   The provided code diff highlights the change from the vulnerable `mapster_wp_maps_set_option` function to a more secure  `mapster_wp_maps_set_tutorial_option` function which only updates a single option.
