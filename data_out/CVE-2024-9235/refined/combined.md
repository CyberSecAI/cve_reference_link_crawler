### Description

The Mapster WP Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to an insufficient capability check on the mapster\_wp\_maps\_set\_option\_from\_js() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.

Victor Temprano from Mapster WP Maps helped me significantly with a question about geo location user tracking. Now our map works as it should. Thanks for the great plugin!

Using the Mapster WP Pro plugin for my wp project, I can confidently say it’s the best plugin I’ve ever worked with and i have really enjoyed customising my map.
Not only does it allow information to become incredibly accessible and user-friendly, but the support from Victor has been absolutely outstanding.
He has consistently responded quickly and honestly, always finding a solution to any issue I’ve encountered.
Victor’s support is, without a doubt, the best I’ve ever experienced with any plugin. I’m excited to launch my project, knowing that Mapster WP Pro will play a crucial role in its success. Highly recommended!

I tested many map plugins, and most were messy and outdated. This one stands out as the most powerful and clean map plugin by far. It has advanced features for creating all types of maps.
Some notable differences compared to other plugins are:- Clean interface that uses the default WP style- Lightweight; only loads CSS/JS where used.- Plenty of advanced features, even in the free version (thank you).

Best plugin in the category (if not the only real option) and excellent support.

I have long lost count on how many different types of plugins I have tried for maps. Since I found Mapster I have stopped looking. I have a very demanding and very specific need with literally thousands of locations, lines and areas that needs to be added, with custom pins, and there is simply nothing else that does it so well as this one, even in the free one. On top of all, Victor is amazingly responsive and helpful.

This plugin can do so many things, especially if you want to step away from google maps (GDPR anybody?). I can only recommend the PRO version, its features give it that extra edge that managing big websites or complicated imports becomes much less stressy and time consuming.
Victor is very dedicated with the support, answers in 24h and always has a solution or a coherent explanation.
