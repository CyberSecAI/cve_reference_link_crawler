- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `ltrx_evo` web application due to a vulnerable call to `sprintf`. The function uses a fixed-size buffer and a user-controlled source without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
    - Insufficient input validation of the `host` parameter in the `Ping` functionality.
    - Use of `sprintf` with a fixed-size buffer and user-controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to overwrite the stack, gain control of the program counter and achieve remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request with a long `host` parameter to the vulnerable `Ping` ajax directive.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web application.
    - The attacker does not need any special permissions.
    - The attacker can be remote.
