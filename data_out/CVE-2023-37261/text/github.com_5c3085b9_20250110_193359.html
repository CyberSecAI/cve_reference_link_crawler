## Fixes/improvements

* Reworked Internet Card filtering rules.
  + Implemented a new, more powerful system and improved default configuration.
  + Internet Card rules are now stored in the "internet.filteringRules" configuration key.
  + The old keys ("internet.whitelist", "internet.blacklist") are no longer used; an automatic migration is done upon upgrading the mod.
* [[#3635](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/3635)] ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using servers with 3 network cards
* [[#3634](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/3634)] Internet card selector update logic erroneously drops non-ready keys
