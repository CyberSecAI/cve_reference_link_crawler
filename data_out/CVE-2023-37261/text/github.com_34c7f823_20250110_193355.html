This file uses typesafe config's HOCON syntax.# Try setting your syntax highlighting to Ruby, to help readability. At least# in Sublime Text that works really well.

Changes to the comments may vanish.# Note that all mentions of 'KB' or 'kilobyte' mean 1024 bytes.opencomputers { # The version of OC this config was generated by. This is used to allow the # mod to reset parts of the config when their meaning changed across # versions, so that the user does not have to delete it. version: "@VERSION@"
 # Client side settings, presentation and performance related stuff. client { # The distance at which to start fading out the text on screens. This is # purely cosmetic, to avoid text disappearing instantly when moving too # far away from a screen. This should have no measurable impact on # performance. Note that this needs OpenGL 1.4 to work, otherwise text # will always just instantly disappear when moving away from the screen # displaying it. screenTextFadeStartDistance: 15.0
 # The maximum distance at which to render text on screens. Rendering text # can be pretty expensive, so if you have a lot of screens you'll want to # avoid huge numbers here. Note that this setting is client-sided, and # only has an impact on render performance on clients. maxScreenTextRenderDistance: 20.0
 # Whether to apply linear filtering for text displayed on screens when the # screen has to be scaled down - i.e. the text is rendered at a resolution # lower than their native one, e.g. when the GUI scale is less than one or # when looking at a far away screen. This leads to smoother text for # scaled down text but results in characters not perfectly connecting # anymore (for example for box drawing characters. Look it up on # Wikipedia.) textLinearFiltering: false
 # If you prefer the text on the screens to be aliased (you know, \*not\* # anti-aliased / smoothed) turn this option off. textAntiAlias: true
 # Render robots' names as a label above them when near them robotLabels: true
 # The volume multiplier applied to sounds from this mod like the computer # running noise. Disable sounds by setting this to zero. soundVolume: 1.0
 # This is the scaling of the individual chars rendered on screens. This # is set to slightly overscale per default, to avoid gaps between fully # filled chars to appear (i.e. the block symbol that is used for cursor # blinking for example) on less accurate hardware. fontCharScale: 1.01
 # The maximum render distance of a hologram projected by a highest tier # hologram projector when at maximum scale. Render distance is scaled # down with the actual scale of the hologram. hologramRenderDistance: 64
 # The distance at which to start fading out the hologram (as with # hologramRenderDistance). This is purely cosmetic, to avoid image # disappearing instantly when moving too far away from a projector. # It does not affect performance. Holograms are transparent anyway. hologramFadeStartDistance: 48
 # This controls how often holograms 'flicker'. This is the chance that it # flickers for \*each frame\*, meaning if you're running at high FPS you # may want to lower this a bit, to avoid it flickering too much. hologramFlickerFrequency: 0.025
 # The color of monochrome text (i.e. displayed when in 1-bit color depth, # e.g. tier one screens / GPUs, or higher tier set to 1-bit color depth). # Defaults to white, feel free to make it some other color, tho! monochromeColor: 0xFFFFFF
 # Which font renderer to use. Defaults to `hexfont` if invalid. # Possible values: # - hexfont: the (since 1.3.2) default font renderer. Font in .hex format # capable of rendering many unicode glyphs. # The used font data can be swapped out using resource packs, # but is harder to work with, since it involves binary data. # - texture: the old, font-texture based font renderer that was used # in OC versions prior to 1.3.2. This will allow overriding # the font texture as before. Keep in mind that this renderer # is slightly less efficient than the new one, and more # importantly, can only render code page 437 (as opposed to... # a \*lot\* of unicode). fontRenderer=hexfont
 # The sample rate used for generating beeps of computers' internal # speakers. Use custom values at your own responsibility here; if it # breaks OC you'll get no support. Some potentially reasonable # lower values are 16000 or even 8000 (which was the old default, but # leads to artifacting on certain frequencies). beepSampleRate: 44100
 # The base volume of beeps generated by computers. This may be in a # range of [0, 127], where 0 means mute (the sound will not even be # generated), and 127 means maximum amplitude / volume. beepVolume: 32
 # The radius in which computer beeps can be heard. beepRadius: 16
 # Position of the power indicator for nanomachines, by default left to the # player's health, specified by negative values. Values in [0, 1) will be # treated as relative positions, values in [1, inf) will be treated as # absolute positions. nanomachineHudPos: [-1, -1]
 # Whether to emit particle effects around players via nanomachines. This # includes the basic particles giving a rough indication of the current # power level of the nanomachines as well as particles emitted by the # particle effect behaviors. enableNanomachinePfx: true }
 # Computer related settings, concerns server performance and security. computer { # The overall number of threads to use to drive computers. Whenever a # computer should run, for example because a signal should be processed or # some sleep timer expired it is queued for execution by a worker thread. # The higher the number of worker threads, the less likely it will be that # computers block each other from running, but the higher the host # system's load may become. threads: 4
 # The time in seconds a program may run without yielding before it is # forcibly aborted. This is used to avoid stupidly written or malicious # programs blocking other computers by locking down the executor threads. # Note that changing this won't have any effect on computers that are # already running - they'll have to be rebooted for this to take effect. timeout: 5.0
 # The time in seconds to wait after a computer has been restored before it # continues to run. This is meant to allow the world around the computer # to settle, avoiding issues such as components in neighboring chunks # being removed and then re-connected and other odd things that might # happen. startupDelay: 0.25
 # The maximum size of the byte array that can be stored on EEPROMs as executable data.. eepromSize: 4096
 # The maximum size of the byte array that can be stored on EEPROMs as configuration data. eepromDataSize: 256
 # The number of components the different CPU tiers support. This list # must contain exactly four entries, or it will be ignored. cpuComponentCount: [ 8 12 16 1024 ]
 # The provided call budgets by the three tiers of CPU and memory. Higher # budgets mean that more direct calls can be performed per tick. You can # raise this to increase the "speed" of computers at the cost of higher # real CPU time. Lower this to lower the load Lua executors put on your # machine / server, at the cost of slower computers. This list must # contain exactly three entries, or it will be ignored. callBudgets: [ 0.5 1.0 1.5 ]
 # This determines whether computers can only be used by players that are # registered as users on them. Per default a newly placed computer has no # users. Whenever there are no users the computer is free for all. Users # can be managed via the Lua API (computer.addUser, computer.removeUser, # computer.users). If this is true, the following interactions are only # possible for users: # - input via the keyboard and touch screen. # - inventory management. # - breaking the computer block. # If this is set to false, all computers will always be usable by all # players, no matter the contents of the user list. Note that operators # are treated as if they were in the user list of every computer, i.e. no # restrictions apply to them. # See also: `maxUsers` and `maxUsernameLength`. canComputersBeOwned: true
 # The maximum number of users that can be registered with a single # computer. This is used to avoid computers allocating unchecked amounts # of memory by registering an unlimited number of users. See also: # `canComputersBeOwned`. maxUsers: 16
 # Sanity check for username length for users registered with computers. We # store the actual user names instead of a hash to allow iterating the # list of registered users on the Lua side. # See also: `canComputersBeOwned`. maxUsernameLength: 32
 # Whether to delete all contents in the /tmp file system when performing # a 'soft' reboot (i.e. via `computer.shutdown(true)`). The tmpfs will # always be erased when the computer is completely powered off, even if # it crashed. This setting is purely for software-triggered reboots. eraseTmpOnReboot: false
 # The time in milliseconds that scheduled computers are forced to wait # before executing more code. This avoids computers to "busy idle", # leading to artificially high CPU load. If you're worried about # performance on your server, increase this number a little (it should # never exceed 50, a single tick, though) to reduce CPU load even more. executionDelay: 12
 # Settings specific to the Lua architecture. lua { # Whether to allow loading precompiled bytecode via Lua's `load` # function, or related functions (`loadfile`, `dofile`). Enable this # only if you absolutely trust all users on your server and all Lua # code you run. This can be a MASSIVE SECURITY RISK, since precompiled # code can easily be used for exploits, running arbitrary code on the # real server! I cannot stress this enough: only enable this is you # know what you're doing. allowBytecode: false
 # Whether to allow user defined \_\_gc callbacks, i.e. \_\_gc callbacks # defined \*inside\* the sandbox. Since garbage collection callbacks # are not sandboxed (hooks are disabled while they run), this is not # recommended. allowGC: false
 # Whether to make the Lua 5.3 architecture available. If enabled, you # can reconfigure any CPU to use the Lua 5.3 architecture. enableLua53: true
 # Whether to make the Lua 5.3 architecture the default architecture. # If enabled, a crafted CPU will first be the Lua 5.3 architecture. defaultLua53: true
 # Whether to make the Lua 5.4 architecture available. If enabled, you # can reconfigure any CPU to use the Lua 5.4 architecture. enableLua54: false
 # The sizes of the six levels of RAM, in kilobytes. This list must # contain exactly six entries, or it will be ignored. Note that while # there are six levels of RAM, they still fall into the three tiers of # items (level 1, 2 = tier 1, level 3, 4 = tier 2, level 5, 6 = tier 3). ramSizes: [ 192 256 384 512 768 1024 ]
 # This setting allows you to fine-tune how RAM sizes are scaled internally # on 64 Bit machines (i.e. when the Minecraft server runs in a 64 Bit VM). # Why is this even necessary? Because objects consume more memory in a 64 # Bit environment than in a 32 Bit one, due to pointers and possibly some # integer types being twice as large. It's actually impossible to break # this down to a single number, so this is really just a rough guess.

For # example, when running a computer with a 64KB RAM module, even if it's # scaled up to 96KB, `computer.totalMemory` will return 64KB, and if there # are really 45KB free, `computer.freeMemory` will return 32KB. ramScaleFor64Bit: 1.8
