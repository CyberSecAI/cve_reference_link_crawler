## Description

### Summary

If the cc-tweaked plugin is running on a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting providers, like AWS, GCP, and Azure, those metadata services API endpoints are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider.

This is a follow up of a vulnerability that [@JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) also reported back in 2017: [dan200/ComputerCraft#170](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues/170)

### Details

The default set of patterns that are forbidden by CC-Tweaked are defined by this predicate:

[CC-Tweaked/projects/core/src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/core/apis/http/options/AddressPredicate.java](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/blob/96847bb8c28df51e5e49f2dd2978ff6cc4e2821b/projects/core/src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/core/apis/http/options/AddressPredicate.java#L116-L126)

Lines 116 to 126
in
[96847bb](/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/commit/96847bb8c28df51e5e49f2dd2978ff6cc4e2821b)

|  | final class PrivatePattern implements AddressPredicate { |
| --- | --- |
|  | static final PrivatePattern INSTANCE = new PrivatePattern(); |
|  |  |
|  | @Override |
|  | public boolean matches(InetAddress socketAddress) { |
|  | return socketAddress.isAnyLocalAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isLoopbackAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isLinkLocalAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isSiteLocalAddress(); |
|  | } |
|  | } |

This, by default, this does include the IP or Domains that most IMDS use:

* IPv4: `169.254.169.254`
* `metadata.google.internal` (in the case of GCP)

However, this, by default, does not include the IPs used by other popular IMDS:

* Oracle Cloud: `192.0.0.192`
* Alibaba Cloud: `100.100.100.200`
* AWS: `fd00:ec2::254`

### PoC

```
http.get("http://100.100.100.200/[cloud host specific path]"):readAll()

```
### Impact

This can allow a player on a server, using a cc-tweaked computer to retrieve sensitive information like:

* User-data passed to the system at boot time (could contain secrets)
* IAM role credentials (could allow access to the greater AWS cloud account)
* Managed identity credentials (could allow access to the Azure account)
* Service account tokens (allowing access to the GCP account)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
