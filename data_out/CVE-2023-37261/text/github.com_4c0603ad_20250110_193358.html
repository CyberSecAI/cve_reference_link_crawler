|  |  | ## Fixes/improvements |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Reworked Internet Card filtering rules. |
|  |  | \* Implemented a new, more powerful system and improved default configuration. |
|  |  | \* Internet Card rules are now stored in the "internet.filteringRules" configuration key. |
|  |  | \* The old keys ("internet.whitelist", "internet.blacklist") are no longer used; an automatic migration is done upon upgrading the mod. |
|  |  | \* [#3635] ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using servers with 3 network cards |
|  |  | \* [#3634] Internet card selector update logic erroneously drops non-ready keys |
