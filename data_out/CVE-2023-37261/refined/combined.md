| I haven't looked at the code to see if this has already been guarded against but I want to bring it to someone's attention in case it hasn't been.  There are certain things you may not want your server users able to poke around with. For example, most routers are running on `192.168.1.1`. I really don't want people on my server able to poke around and access my router's admin console (I have a password but let's be honest here, how many people actually change the default password).  Many people running servers probably aren't using a hosting service and having http/tcp enabled currently gives players full access to the server's internal network.  It's a simple bit of code to have your users tinkering with the server hosters router.  I opened a similar issue against the computercraft mod.

## Package

OpenComputers
(Minecraft Mod)

## Affected versions

1.2.0+

## Patched versions

1.8.3

([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

1.8.3

## Description

### Summary

If the OpenComputers mod is installed as part of a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting provider, such as AWS, GCP and Azure, those metadata services' API endpoints are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider.

In addition, IPv6 addresses are not correctly filtered at all, allowing broader access into the local IPv6 network.

This is a follow up of a vulnerability that [@JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) also reported back in 2017:

* [#2365](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/2365)

### Details

The default set of domains that are forbidden by OpenComputers are defined here:

[OpenComputers/src/main/resources/application.conf](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/blob/5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0/src/main/resources/application.conf#L966-L986)

Lines 966 to 986
in
[5b2ba76](/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/commit/5b2ba76a4c242b369b9b6ac6196fd04d96580ad0)

|  | # This is a list of forbidden domain names. If an HTTP request is made |
| --- | --- |
|  | # or a socket connection is opened the target address will be compared |
|  | # to the addresses / address ranges in this list. It it is present in this |
|  | # list, the request will be denied. |
|  | # Entries are either domain names (www.example.com) or IP addresses in |
|  | # string format (10.0.0.3), optionally in CIDR notation to make it easier |
|  | # to define address ranges (1.0.0.0/8). Domains are resolved to their |
|  | # actual IP once on startup, future requests are resolved and compared |
|  | # to the resolved addresses. |
|  | # By default all local addresses are blocked. This is only meant as a |
|  | # thin layer of security, to avoid average users hosting a game on their |
|  | # local machine having players access services in their local network. |
|  | # Server hosters are expected to configure their network outside of the |
|  | # mod's context in an appropriate manner, e.g. using a system firewall. |
|  | blacklist: [ |
|  | "127.0.0.0/8" |
|  | "0.0.0.0/8" |
|  | "10.0.0.0/8" |
|  | "192.168.0.0/16" |
|  | "172.16.0.0/12" |
|  | ] |

And those are interpreted here:

|  | case Some(cidrPattern(address, prefix)) => |
|  | val addr = InetAddresses.coerceToInteger(InetAddresses.forString(address)) |
|  | val mask = 0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - prefix.toInt) |
|  | val min = addr & mask |
|  | val max = min | ~mask |
|  | (inetAddress: InetAddress, host: String) => Some(inetAddress match { |
|  | case v4: Inet4Address => |
|  | val numeric = InetAddresses.coerceToInteger(v4) |
|  | min <= numeric && numeric <= max |
|  | case \_ => true // Can't check IPv6 addresses so we pass them. |
|  | }) |
|  | case \_ => |
|  | val address = InetAddress.getByName(value) |

|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | def apply(inetAddress: InetAddress, host: String) = validator(inetAddress, host) |
|  | } |

Unfortunately, by default, this list does not include the IP or Domains used by most IMDS:

* IPv4: `169.254.169.254`
* IPv6: `fd00:ec2::254` (in the case of AWS)
* `metadata.google.internal` (in the case of GCP)
* Oracle Cloud: `192.0.0.192`
* Alibaba Cloud: `100.100.100.200`

### Impact

This can allow a player on a server using an OpenComputers computer to access parts of the private IPv4 address space, as well as the whole IPv6 address space, in order to retrieve sensitive information like:

* User-data passed to the system at boot time (could contain secrets)
* IAM role credentials (could allow access to the greater AWS cloud account)
* Managed identity credentials (could allow access to the Azure account)
* Service account tokens (allowing access to the GCP account)

This issue affects every version of OpenComputers with the Internet Card feature enabled; that is, OpenComputers 1.2.0 and above in their most common, default configurations.

### Mitigations

* The following mitigation strategies are available, in order from most to least recommended:
  + Upgrading to a non-affected version of OpenComputers (v1.8.3 for Minecraft 1.7.10 and 1.12.2),
  + Disabling the Internet Card feature completely,
  + If using OpenComputers 1.3.0 or above, the following can also be done:
    - Using the allow list (`opencomputers.internet.whitelist` option) - this will prohibit connections to any IP addresses and/or domains not listed.
    - Adding the following entries to the block list (`opencomputers.internet.blacklist` option):

```
      "100.64.0.0/10",
      "169.254.0.0/16",

      "203.0.113.0/24",
      "224.0.0.0/3"

```

Note that, while filtering IPv6 addresses is not directly supported, thanks to an IPv4 coercion implemented by OpenComputers 1.3.0 and above, blocking `224.0.0.0/3` will also block all IPv6 addresses.

CC-Tweaked
(Minecraft Mod)

1.106.0

## Description

### Summary

If the cc-tweaked plugin is running on a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting providers, like AWS, GCP, and Azure, those metadata services API endpoints are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted") by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider.

This is a follow up of a vulnerability that [@JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) also reported back in 2017: [dan200/ComputerCraft#170](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/issues/170)

### Details

The default set of patterns that are forbidden by CC-Tweaked are defined by this predicate:

[CC-Tweaked/projects/core/src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/core/apis/http/options/AddressPredicate.java](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/blob/96847bb8c28df51e5e49f2dd2978ff6cc4e2821b/projects/core/src/main/java/dan200/computercraft/core/apis/http/options/AddressPredicate.java#L116-L126)

Lines 116 to 126
in
[96847bb](/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/commit/96847bb8c28df51e5e49f2dd2978ff6cc4e2821b)

|  | final class PrivatePattern implements AddressPredicate { |
| --- | --- |
|  | static final PrivatePattern INSTANCE = new PrivatePattern(); |
|  |  |
|  | @Override |
|  | public boolean matches(InetAddress socketAddress) { |
|  | return socketAddress.isAnyLocalAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isLoopbackAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isLinkLocalAddress() |
|  | || socketAddress.isSiteLocalAddress(); |
|  | } |
|  | } |

This, by default, this does include the IP or Domains that most IMDS use:

* IPv4: `169.254.169.254`
* `metadata.google.internal` (in the case of GCP)

However, this, by default, does not include the IPs used by other popular IMDS:

* Oracle Cloud: `192.0.0.192`
* Alibaba Cloud: `100.100.100.200`
* AWS: `fd00:ec2::254`

### PoC

```
http.get("http://100.100.100.200/[cloud host specific path]"):readAll()

```
### Impact

This can allow a player on a server, using a cc-tweaked computer to retrieve sensitive information like:

* User-data passed to the system at boot time (could contain secrets)
* IAM role credentials (could allow access to the greater AWS cloud account)
* Managed identity credentials (could allow access to the Azure account)
* Service account tokens (allowing access to the GCP account)

 # Power settings, buffer sizes and power consumption. power { # Whether to ignore any power requirements. Whenever something requires # power to function, it will try to get the amount of energy it needs from # the buffer of its connector node, and in case it fails it won't perform # the action / trigger a shutdown / whatever.

The converter will however # not accept power from other mods. ignorePower: false
 # This determines how often continuous power sinks try to actually try to # consume energy from the network. This includes computers, robots and # screens.

If set # to 1, this would query every tick. The default queries every 10 ticks, # or in other words twice per second. # Higher values mean more responsive power consumption, but slightly more # work per tick (shouldn't be that noticeable, though).

 # The amount of energy a Charger transfers to each adjacent robot per tick # if a maximum strength redstone signal is set.

 # The amount of energy a screen consumes per tick. For each lit pixel # (each character that is not blank) this cost increases linearly: # for basic screens, if all pixels are lit the cost per tick will be # this value.

## Fixes/improvements

* Reworked Internet Card filtering rules.
  + Implemented a new, more powerful system and improved default configuration.
  + Internet Card rules are now stored in the "internet.filteringRules" configuration key.
  + The old keys ("internet.whitelist", "internet.blacklist") are no longer used; an automatic migration is done upon upgrading the mod.
* [[#3635](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/3635)] ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using servers with 3 network cards
* [[#3634](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/issues/3634)] Internet card selector update logic erroneously drops non-ready keys
