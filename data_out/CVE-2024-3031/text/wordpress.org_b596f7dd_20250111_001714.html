### [Works well but limited customizeability](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-well-but-limited-customizeability-1/)

[Pedro Magnifico](https://profiles.wordpress.org/pedro-magnifico/ "Posts by Pedro Magnifico")

Easy to implement but would be vastly improved with:
• More control over styling: bar borders and shadows; fonts, font weights and sizes; button and button text styling (I had to use custom CSS to remove bottom border & shadow and change text and button styling)
• Placement options on specific page(s) (workaround: “plugin logic” plugin)
• Ability to create multiple banners to be used concurrently (different banners on different pages), random loads or just to save for future use
• More control over when the banner appears. Maybe I don’t want a 5 minute or longer delay between banner loads.
