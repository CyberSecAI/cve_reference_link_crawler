Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-28277:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `RemoveUnknownSections` function within `jpgfile.c`. This occurs when processing JPEG files with extraneous padding bytes before certain sections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in the `RemoveUnknownSections` function.
- Incorrect memory handling during processing of JPEG files with extraneous padding, leading to reading beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS). The AddressSanitizer report indicates a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow. The program will terminate abruptly when processing a crafted JPEG file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted JPEG file that contains extraneous padding before certain sections. By processing this malformed file using `jhead`, a heap-based buffer overflow is triggered during the parsing of metadata.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPEG file to the `jhead` utility. This could be achieved through user interaction, or in a scenario where the jhead program processes arbitrary user-provided files.
