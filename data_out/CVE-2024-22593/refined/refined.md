Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing CSRF protection mechanism in the `/system/admin/add_group_save` endpoint of FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user. Specifically, the `/system/admin/add_group_save` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create new admin groups in the system without the knowledge or consent of the logged-in admin user. This can lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized access and control over the CMS system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated user of FlyCms, submits a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page or link.
- The attacker needs to target a logged in user of FlyCms
- The attacker does not require access to the CMS itself, only the ability to trick the user into loading their malicious HTML.
