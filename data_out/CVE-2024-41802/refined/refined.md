Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-41802:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when filtering DataSets within the Xibo CMS. Specifically, SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the API routes responsible for filtering datasets, when importing JSON, and when importing a layout containing dataset data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). Malicious SQL code can be injected through the API parameters used for filtering data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize user-provided input, particularly when constructing SQL queries. This allows attackers to manipulate the generated queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to obtain arbitrary data from the Xibo database, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can also modify data within the database.
- **Arbitrary Data Access:** It allows access to data beyond what the user should normally have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Routes:** The vulnerability is present in the API routes used for importing JSON data, importing layouts containing dataset data, and for filtering datasets.
- **Specifically crafted input:** Attackers inject specially crafted values into the API parameters to perform SQL Injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Xibo CMS.
- **Privileges:** The attacker needs one of the following privileges:
    - Access to the DataSet feature.
    - Access to the Layout feature.
- **Network Access:** The attack is network-based.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Xibo CMS versions 1.8.0 and later are affected, specifically before versions 3.3.12 and 4.0.14.
- **Patched Versions:** Versions 3.3.12 and 4.0.14 and later contain the fix for this issue.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS v3 score of 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).
- **Patch Details:** The provided diffs show the code changes that address the SQL injection vulnerability by using parameterized queries, which prevent direct injection of SQL code.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sergey Bobrov (Kaspersky)
