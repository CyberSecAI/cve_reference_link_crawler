# Sensitive Information Disclosure abusing SQL Injection in Xibo CMS DataSet Data Import

High

Jul 30, 2024

## Package

composer

Xibo CMS
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

=>1.8.0,<3.3.12,<4.0.13

## Patched versions

>=3.3.12,>=4.0.14

## Description

### Impact

An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in the API routes inside the CMS responsible for Filtering DataSets. This allows an authenticated user to to obtain and modify arbitrary data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the APIs for importing JSON and importing a Layout containing DataSet data.

Exploitation of the vulnerability is possible on behalf of an authorized user who has either of the following privileges:

- Access to DataSet Feature

- Access to the Layout Feature

### Patches

**Users should upgrade to version 3.3.12 or 4.0.14 which fix this issue**. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage have been patched across all vulnerable versions.

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a fixed version is necessary to remediate.

Patches are available for earlier versions of Xibo CMS that are out of security support:

* [2.3 patch](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/commit/b7a5899338cd841a39702e3fcaff76aa0ffe4075)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
