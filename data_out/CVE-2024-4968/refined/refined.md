Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure of the "Interactive Map App" to properly sanitize user-supplied data. Specifically, the application does not adequately encode or filter input provided for the 'Marker Name' field before displaying it on the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the application directly embeds user-supplied input into the HTML without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
- This injected code is executed within the context of the user's browser, allowing the attacker to:
  - Steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
  - Potentially redirect the user to malicious sites.
  - Carry out other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 'Marker Name' input field in the "Add Marker" functionality of the "Interactive Map App".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Interactive Map App" and interact with the "Add Marker" functionality.
- No special privileges are required beyond being able to submit data to the vulnerable input field.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting the following payload: `"><img src=x onerror=alert(window.location)>` into the 'Marker Name' field.
- This payload uses the `onerror` event of an `img` tag to execute JavaScript code, which in this case is `alert(window.location)`, which will display an alert box showing the URL of the current page.
- The application directly renders this injected payload, resulting in the execution of the JavaScript code.
