Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2021-47005**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `get_features` operation of `pci_epc_ops` may return NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in the `pci_epf_test_alloc_space` function. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `pci_epf_test_bind` function where `pci_epc_get_features` may return NULL. The code was then dereferencing this NULL `epc_features` pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when the platform driver does not implement EPC features, leading to a NULL return from the `get_features` call. This can occur during the binding process of a PCI endpoint function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trigger the `pci_epf_test_bind` function in a scenario where the platform driver does not implement EPC features. This implies the attacker needs to have the capability to bind a PCI endpoint function via `configfs`.
