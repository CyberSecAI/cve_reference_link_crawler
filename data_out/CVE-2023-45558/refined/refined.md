Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The mini-app 'Golden' on Line exposes the 'client secret' in the client-side response to the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200):** The client secret, a critical credential, is exposed in the HTTP response, making it accessible to unauthorized actors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can obtain the client secret.
- **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** Using the client secret, an attacker can acquire the channel access token.
- **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the 'Golden' mini-app through the Line platform. This includes, but is not limited to, website links and fraud information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Interception/Monitoring:** The client secret is exposed in an HTTP response, making it susceptible to network interception or monitoring by malicious actors.
- **Client-Side Access:** An attacker can obtain the client secret by simply observing the response to the specified URL while using the 'Golden' mini-app in Line.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the response of the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` while using the 'Golden' mini-app. This can be achieved through network interception or by simply inspecting the network traffic of the application.
- The attacker needs access to the Line app.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects the 'Golden' mini-app on Line, version v13.6.1.
- The provided content includes screenshots showing the exposure of the client secret and the process of using the secret to obtain the channel access token.
