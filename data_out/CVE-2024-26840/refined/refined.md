Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26840:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26840. This is evident in the Debian LTS advisories (DLA-3840-1, DLA-3842-1) and the commit messages from the Linux kernel source code, which explicitly mention this CVE ID. The git commits also refer to a memory leak in the cachefiles module, which is the core of the vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `cachefiles_add_cache()` function of the Linux kernel's cachefiles module. Specifically, the `cache_cred` (credentials) object was not properly released under certain error conditions within the function, and when unbinding the cache.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Memory Leak:** Failure to release the `cache_cred` object when an error occurs during the cache adding process or when unbinding a cache. This leads to the accumulation of unreferenced memory which eventually can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:** Repeatedly triggering the memory leak could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially crashing the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is the usage of the cachefiles module, specifically by binding and unbinding to /dev/cachefiles. By doing so in a way that triggers the error paths, the leak occurs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need the ability to interact with the cachefiles module, typically through system calls that trigger the binding and unbinding operations, which most userspace programs can achieve.

**3. Patch Details**
The provided patches address the vulnerability by adding `put_cred(cache->cache_cred)` calls in the following locations:

* In the error handling path within `cachefiles_add_cache()` in `fs/cachefiles/cache.c` and `fs/cachefiles/bind.c`. This ensures that the `cache_cred` is released if an error occurs.
* In the `cachefiles_daemon_unbind()` function in `fs/cachefiles/daemon.c` and `fs/cachefiles/bind.c`. This ensures the `cache_cred` is released when the cache is unbound.

**4. Additional Notes**
The fix is included in multiple stable kernel releases. The provided Debian LTS advisories indicate that the fix is included in linux packages of version 4.19.316-1 and 5.10.216-1~deb10u1.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-26840 is a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's cachefiles module, which can be exploited by repeatedly binding and unbinding cachefiles. The fix involves ensuring proper release of the `cache_cred` object in error handling paths and during cache unbinding.
