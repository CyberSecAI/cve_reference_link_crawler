Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-47126

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ip6_route_info_create` function within the Linux kernel's IPv6 routing implementation. When creating a new IPv6 route, if a nexthop (nh) is specified but certain conditions are met (e.g., source routing is also specified, or the nexthop is invalid), the function jumps to a cleanup section. In this cleanup path, `fib6_info_release` is called, which in turn calls `fib6_info_destroy_rcu`. Critically, `fib6_info_destroy_rcu` attempts to access `f6i->fib6_nh` and release it. However, when these error conditions occur, `fib6_nh` has not been allocated yet, resulting in a use-after-free or out-of-bounds read when trying to access the uninitialized pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free/Out-of-bounds read:** The core vulnerability is that the code attempts to dereference a pointer (`f6i->fib6_nh`) that has not been allocated or initialized when an error occurs during route creation. This results in accessing an invalid memory location, leading to a crash.
- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The error handling in `ip6_route_info_create` was not properly cleaning up resources, specifically the `fib6_nh` when the allocation of it failed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic/Crash:** The most immediate impact is a kernel crash due to the out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not explicitly mentioned, the kernel crash may indicate memory corruption, which can potentially be used to achieve more severe exploits. However, no further information was provided in the reports.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Configuration:** The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating IPv6 routing configurations via the `rtnetlink` interface, specifically by creating routes with invalid combinations of source routing and nexthops, or using a deleted nexthop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN`:** An attacker must have the ability to configure network interfaces and routing, which usually requires administrative or root-level access (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`). Alternatively a user with the ability to create overlay filesystems.
- **Ability to craft specific route creation requests:** The attacker has to be able to construct specific route addition requests, for example using the `ip` command, to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was detected by the syzkaller fuzzer, which uncovered a KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) report indicating the out-of-bounds read.
- The fix involves adding a cleanup path to free allocated `fib6_metrics` and the `rt` pointer before returning the error rather than attempting to release the uninitialized nexthop field
- The fix was backported to stable kernels.

In summary, this CVE describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's IPv6 routing code that can be triggered by sending specific `rtnetlink` requests that create routes with invalid configurations. This vulnerability can result in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service. An attacker needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities to exploit it by constructing such requests.
