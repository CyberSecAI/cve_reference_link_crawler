- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OAS Platform's configuration management tool exposes a remote file browser that allows authenticated users within the OAS Engine to view the directory tree of the underlying system. The application does not properly restrict file system access based on the underlying system's authorization controls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insufficient access controls on the file system. Specifically, the `Browse_file` protobuf allows an authenticated user within the OAS Engine, who may not have access to the underlying operating system, to browse the file system based on the permissions of the OAS Engine's system account.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the file system by listing directories and files, potentially leading to further exploitation or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: Network requests sent to the OAS Engine configuration server using a specially crafted series of requests that include the `Browse_file` protobuf within an authenticated request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OAS Engine. They do not need to have access to the underlying operating system, only to the application layer.
