Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3360 (based on the content provided and the context of the query)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `admin/books/index.php` file of the Online Library System version 1.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to:
    - Access sensitive data (customer information, personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property)
    - Delete or alter data without authorization
    - Potentially gain further access to the system by using techniques like UNION query injection to read database tables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `admin/books/index.php` file, manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. This typically means they must be able to access the application's web server.
- No special privileges are needed; any user who can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application may trigger the vulnerability by crafting malicious `id` parameter values.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided GitHub link demonstrates the vulnerability using the SQLmap tool. The tool identified various SQL injection types, including:
    - Boolean-based blind
    - Error-based
    - Time-based blind
    - UNION query
