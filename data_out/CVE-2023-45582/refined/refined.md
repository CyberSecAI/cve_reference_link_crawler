- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of rate limiting on the login mechanism of FortiMail webmail, which allows an attacker to make repeated login attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts [CWE-307].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can perform a brute force attack on the affected endpoints, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through repeated login attempts on the FortiMail webmail interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the webmail login page, and does not need any authentication to start the attack.
