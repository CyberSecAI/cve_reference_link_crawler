Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The EVE OS's Pillar container checks for the existence and content of `/config/authorized_keys` during boot.
*   If the file exists and contains a valid public key, it enables `sshd` and allows root login using the provided key.
*   The `/config` partition where the `authorized_keys` file resides is not protected by "measured boot," is mutable, and is not encrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** The authorized SSH keys are stored in an unprotected location on the filesystem.
*   **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-922):** Sensitive information (SSH keys) is stored in a mutable and unencrypted partition.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the intended authentication mechanisms by manipulating the `/config/authorized_keys` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** By adding their own SSH keys to `/config/authorized_keys`, an attacker gains full root access to the system.
*   **Bypass of Measured Boot:** The attacker can gain control without triggering the "measured boot" mechanism, meaning the device is not marked as compromised or undergoing an unauthorized update, maintaining stealth.
*   **Access to the Vault:** Full control over the device grants the attacker access to the vault, potentially containing more sensitive information and other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The vulnerability relies on the attacker's ability to modify the `/config` partition, which is likely through physical access to the device.
*   **Pre-Boot Manipulation:** The attacker can modify the `/config/authorized_keys` file before the system boots, allowing them to log in as soon as the system becomes operational.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to modify the `/config` partition.
*   **Ability to Modify Filesystem:** The attacker must be able to modify the contents of the `/config` partition, which is mutable by design.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 9.0.0 of EVE OS when the relevant calculation was moved to PCR14 but not included in the measured boot process.
*   A partial fix has been implemented in later commits by adding the `/config` partition measurement to PCR13.
*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically in the technical root cause and how measured boot is bypassed.
