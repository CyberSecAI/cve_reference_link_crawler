The provided content is a security advisory from the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) regarding vulnerabilities in two financial security solutions: VestCert and TCO!stream.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The advisory states that both VestCert and TCO!stream have remote code execution vulnerabilities. However, it does not elaborate on the technical details of these vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities exist in:
  - VestCert versions 2.3.6 to 2.5.29
  - TCO!stream versions 8.0.22.1115 and below.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. The advisory does not detail the level of access gained, but remote code execution often implies the ability to gain substantial control of the system, potentially leading to complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, suggesting that an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the systems running vulnerable versions of VestCert or TCO!stream. The advisory does not provide specifics on whether the attacker needs to be on the same local network or can be remote over the internet.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory recommends updating to the latest versions of each product to mitigate the vulnerability.
- For VestCert, users are advised to first remove the vulnerable program, ensuring proper termination of related processes, before reinstalling the updated version.
- TCO!stream is automatically updated when service operators update to the latest version.
