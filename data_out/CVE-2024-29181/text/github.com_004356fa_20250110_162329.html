## Package

npm

@strapi/plugin-content-manager
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=4.19.0

## Patched versions

4.19.1

## Description

### Summary

1. As a super admin if i create a collection where an item in collection has an association to another collection another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created.

### Details

At the top level every collection shows blank items for an Author if they did not create the item. This is ideal and works great. However if you associate one private collection to another private collection and an Author creates a new item. The pull down should not show the admins list of previously created items. It should be blank unitl they add their own items.

### PoC

1. Sign in as Admin. Navigate to content creation.
2. Select a collection and verify you have items you created there. And that they have associations to other protected collections.
3. Verify role permissions for your collections are set to CRUD if user created.
4. Log out and sign in as a unrelated Author.
5. Navigate to content management and verify you see collections built by admin but empty for you (as expected)
6. Create a new item as an Author and see the card appear with attributes to fill out.
7. Use the form pull down for the associations.
8. Notice that protected collection items from Admin appear in drop down. These should be hidden

### Impact

Security vulnerability where authors have access to protected data created by admin. This could be passwords emails or any other item created for the admin's collection.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
