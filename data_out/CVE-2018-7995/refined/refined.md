Root cause of vulnerability:
A race condition exists in the x86 MCE (Machine Check Exception) driver when multiple CPUs concurrently write to the check_interval file in sysfs. This file controls the MCE polling timer interval.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of synchronization: The mce_timer variable and related operations were not properly protected against concurrent access from multiple CPUs. Specifically, the initialization of the mce_timer lock could occur while other CPUs were using it, leading to synchronization errors.
- Race Condition: Multiple CPUs writing to the check_interval file concurrently could lead to a race condition, causing issues in timer management.

Impact of exploitation:
- Kernel panic or hang: The race condition could lead to synchronization errors, causing the kernel to panic or hang.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could trigger this race condition, resulting in a system crash, thus achieving a denial-of-service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (mentioned in some sources, but considered unlikely): While some sources mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution, this is not the main concern, and other sources state it is unlikely to be security relevant.

Attack vectors:
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to write to the check_interval file through the sysfs interface.
- Root privileges: The attacker needs root privileges to write to the affected sysfs variables.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local access to the system
- Root user privileges

Additional details:
- The vulnerability lies in the mce.c file, where the `store_int_with_restart()` function is responsible for updating the check_interval timer.
- The fix involves adding a mutex (`mce_sysfs_mutex`) to serialize access to the timer and sysfs functions. This prevents concurrent modifications and race conditions.
- The issue is considered not a big deal security-wise because only root can write to the affected sysfs variables.
- The patch also adds input validation, limiting the minimum interval to 1 second and filtering out negative values.
