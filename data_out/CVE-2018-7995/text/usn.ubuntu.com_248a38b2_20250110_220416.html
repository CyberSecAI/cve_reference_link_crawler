# USN-3656-1: Linux kernel (Raspberry Pi 2, Snapdragon) vulnerabilities

22 May 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-18222](/security/CVE-2017-18222))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1065](/security/CVE-2018-1065))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1068](/security/CVE-2018-1068))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1130](/security/CVE-2018-1130))

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-5803](/security/CVE-2018-5803))

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7480](/security/CVE-2018-7480))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-7757](/security/CVE-2018-7757))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check

handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-7995](/security/CVE-2018-7995))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8781](/security/CVE-2018-8781))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1090-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1090.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1090.98)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-1093-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1093.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1093.98)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
