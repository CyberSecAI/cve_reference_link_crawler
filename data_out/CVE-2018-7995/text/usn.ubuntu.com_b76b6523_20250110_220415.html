## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-18222](/security/CVE-2017-18222))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

validate that rules containing jumps contained user-defined chains. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1065](/security/CVE-2018-1065))

It was discovered that the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ebtables offsets. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-1068](/security/CVE-2018-1068))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the DCCP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1130](/security/CVE-2018-1130))

It was discovered that the SCTP Protocol implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate userspace provided payload lengths in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-5803](/security/CVE-2018-5803))

It was discovered that a double free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when setting up a request queue. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7480](/security/CVE-2018-7480))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the SAS driver subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-7757](/security/CVE-2018-7757))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the x86 machine check

handler in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-7995](/security/CVE-2018-7995))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the USB displaylink video adapter driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate mmap offsets sent from userspace. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8781](/security/CVE-2018-8781))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.
