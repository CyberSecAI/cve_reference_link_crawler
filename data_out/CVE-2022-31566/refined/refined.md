Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to the CVEs mentioned:

**General Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary root cause for all the vulnerabilities described in these advisories is the unsafe use of the `flask.send_file` function in various Flask-based Python web applications. This function is used to send files to the user's browser but, when used improperly, allows attackers to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The main weakness is **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. The use of `os.path.join` with unsanitized user input, which can include absolute paths or `../` sequences, bypasses the intended directory and allows an attacker to access arbitrary files.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through HTTP requests, injecting malicious path names that are then passed to the vulnerable `send_file` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attackers require no special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerabilities. They can exploit it by crafting malicious HTTP requests.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of exploitation is primarily a high risk to confidentiality as an attacker can read arbitrary files. The availability is low because while access to large files could cause issues, it is not the main attack vector. There is no impact to integrity, as the ability to modify data is not implied by the attack.
*   **Scope**: The scope of these vulnerabilties is classified as "changed" meaning the vulnerable component is able to impact resources outside its defined security scope.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content references a discussion about a "Bug Slayer" program, highlighting the semi-automated process of discovering and reporting vulnerabilities using tools like CodeQL. This discussion also raises concerns about the validity and impact of CVEs assigned to small, personal, and unmaintained projects. Some CVEs are challenged because the target repositories are not actual products that are used by others. This discussion is not specific to any of the CVEs but it provides a broader view of the context they are found in.

**Mitigation:**

The recommended remediation for these vulnerabilities is to:

1.  **Avoid Directly Using User Input with `send_file`:** Prevent user-supplied strings directly influence the path passed to the `send_file` function.
2.  **Use `safe_join` for Relative Paths:** When constructing paths from user-controlled segments, utilize the `flask.safe_join` function that validates that the resulting path is within the defined directory.
3.  **Use `send_from_directory` for Serving Files:** Instead of `send_file`, use `flask.send_from_directory`, which expects the file to be relative to a specific directory. It prevents traversal by restricting the locations files can be sent from.
4. Input sanitization and validation must also be put into place when dealing with filepaths.

**Conclusion:**

The vulnerabilities stem from a common pattern, i.e. not sanitizing input that affects the files accessed by the Flask `send_file` function. The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive files through path traversal. All of these reports highlight the importance of handling paths and file access with caution, especially when user-supplied input is involved.

It's also important to note, that there is a lack of consistent information about affected and patched versions in the advisories, which suggests that the affected projects are potentially abandoned or not properly maintained.
