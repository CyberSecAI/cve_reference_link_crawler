The provided content is related to CVE-2024-32303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `fromWizardHandle` function of the Tenda AC15 firmware. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the `PPW` parameter in a POST request within the function `decodePwd`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `decodePwd` function copies the user-provided `PPW` parameter into a fixed-size buffer `decode_pwd` without checking its length.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation: The firmware does not properly validate or limit the size of the `PPW` parameter before passing it to `decodePwd`, allowing an attacker to supply an arbitrarily large input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.
- Denial of Service: A crash of the device could be achieved with a large payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WizardHandle` endpoint.
- The POST request contains the parameters `WANS`, `WANT` set to 0 and 2 respectively and a malicious `PPW` parameter that is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Tenda AC15 router.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.
