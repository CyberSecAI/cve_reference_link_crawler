Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way dm-crypt handles authenticated encryption. When using authenticated encryption, modifying the data being encrypted could lead to an invalid authentication tag. This could potentially result in data corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core issue is that dm-crypt was directly encrypting data within the original bio (block I/O structure), which allowed for modification before encryption was complete, invalidating the authentication tag.
- Specifically, when using O_DIRECT, the user could write and modify data concurrently, causing inconsistencies with the tag computed during encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data corruption: By modifying data being written during the authenticated encryption process, an attacker can cause the resulting encrypted data to have an invalid authentication tag, which would indicate corruption upon decryption.
- Device corruption: The corruption caused by an invalid authentication tag can lead to corruption of the underlying storage device.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves writing data to a dm-crypt device using authenticated encryption and modifying the data during the encryption process.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is exposed through the O_DIRECT flag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to write to a dm-crypt device using authenticated encryption.
- The attacker must be able to modify the data while the data is being encrypted, which is possible via the O_DIRECT flag, which bypasses the buffer cache.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves creating a clone of the original bio, copying the data to the clone, and then performing encryption on the clone bio. This ensures that the original data cannot be modified during the encryption, preventing the invalid tag issue.
- This change may reduce performance due to the overhead of copying the data, but it is deemed necessary to ensure data integrity.
- The fix is applied to the `kcryptd_crypt_write_convert` function in `drivers/md/dm-crypt.c`.
- The commit messages explicitly mention the issue of invalid authentication tags due to data modification during encryption when using O_DIRECT.
