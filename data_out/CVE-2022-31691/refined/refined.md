- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of the Snakeyaml library for YAML editing support in Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse and various VSCode extensions. Snakeyaml allows for special syntax in YAML that, under certain circumstances, can lead to remote code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the insecure handling of YAML parsing by the Snakeyaml library, which allows for the inclusion of malicious code within YAML files. This is due to the library's ability to process certain special syntax that can lead to code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system where the affected software is running.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a malicious YAML file containing the special syntax that triggers the vulnerability. This malicious YAML file can then be loaded by a vulnerable version of the affected Spring Tools 4 or VSCode extensions when editing a YAML file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted YAML file to the affected software through means of the built in yaml editor. This could be done by tricking a user into loading a malicious file or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject the malicious YAML data.
