  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The full screen notification could be obscured by the file open dialog.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The fullscreen notification is drawn in the content window which can be covered by other elements.",
      "The file open dialog can appear on top of the fullscreen notification.",
      "The fullscreen notification would auto-hide after a short time even if obscured by a file dialog or similar."
    ],
    "impact": "A website could obscure the full screen notification, leading to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website can trigger a fullscreen request.",
      "The website then triggers a file open dialog."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website and interact with the page to trigger a fullscreen request and a file open dialog.",
     "additional_details": "The fix ensures that the fullscreen notification reappears after the file picker is closed if it was hidden by the file open dialog, or if the user switches focus to another window before the notification's auto-hide timer expires (3 seconds). The fix does not apply to user-initiated focus shifts."
