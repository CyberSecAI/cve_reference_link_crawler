Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `node-qpdf`.

## Overview

[node-qpdf](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-qpdf) is an A Content Preserving transformations on PDFs wrapped around QPDF

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command such that the package-exported method `encrypt()` fails to sanitize its parameter input, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they can specify the input pdf file path.

## PoC

```
var qpdf = require('node-qpdf');

var options = {
    keyLength: 128,
    password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD_TO_ENCRYPT'
}

qpdf.encrypt('test.pdf ||touch rce||', options); // a file named rce will be created

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

| Hi,  We would like to report a potential security vulnerability. The bug is introduced because the package-exported method `encrypt()` fails to sanitize its parameter `input`, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they can specify the input pdf file path.  Here is the proof of concept.  ``` var qpdf = require('node-qpdf');  var options = {     keyLength: 128,     password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD_TO_ENCRYPT' }  qpdf.encrypt('test.pdf ||touch rce||', options); // a file named rce will be created  ``` |
