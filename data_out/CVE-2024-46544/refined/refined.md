Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-46544

**Root Cause:** Incorrect default permissions on shared memory used by `mod_jk`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The `mod_jk` module on Unix-like systems uses shared memory to store its configuration.
*   Default permissions on this shared memory are too permissive.
*   This allows local users to read and modify the shared memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Local users can view the `mod_jk` configuration, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service:** Local users can modify the `mod_jk` configuration, potentially causing the module to malfunction and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access on Unix-like systems where `mod_jk` is deployed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have local user access on the affected system.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.9-beta through 1.2.49
*   Specifically, the vulnerability affects `mod_jk` on Unix-like systems. The ISAPI redirector and `mod_jk` on Windows are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Apache Tomcat Connectors version 1.2.50 or later.
*   Debian has released a fix in version `1:1.2.48-1+deb11u2` for Debian 11 bullseye.
