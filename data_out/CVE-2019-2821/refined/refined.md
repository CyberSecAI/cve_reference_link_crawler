Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2821:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) component of OpenJDK. It stems from the improper handling of OCSP stapling messages during the TLS handshake process in certain scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The core weakness is the inadequate handling of OCSP stapling messages within the JSSE component. This improper handling can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to expose sensitive information. The specific details of what information could be exposed aren't provided but relate to the TLS handshake and OCSP stapling.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted TLS handshake where the JSSE component is involved in handling OCSP stapling. It is triggered when the vulnerable component handles the handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a TLS handshake with a vulnerable server that is using OCSP stapling and the vulnerable OpenJDK component. They need the capability to influence or control aspects of the TLS handshake, specifically the OCSP stapling messages.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-2821 is a vulnerability in OpenJDK's JSSE component where improper handling of OCSP stapling during TLS handshakes can lead to sensitive information disclosure. An attacker needs to be in a position to perform a TLS handshake to trigger this vulnerability.
