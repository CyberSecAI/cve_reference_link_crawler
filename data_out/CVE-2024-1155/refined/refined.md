Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions in the installation directories of shared SystemLink Elixir-based services. These services are part of several NI products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is that the installation directories for certain SystemLink Elixir-based services have overly permissive access controls. Specifically, "Users" and "Authenticated Users" have more permissions than they should.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can lead to a local privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An authenticated user with local access can exploit this to gain elevated privileges on the system. The specific details of how this is done are not provided, but the potential for full compromise (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact) exists.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker must already have some form of access to the affected machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a user who is already authenticated on the system.
- **Local Access:** They need to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
