- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `_TIFFmemcpy` function within `tif_unix.c`. This is triggered during the writing of a TIFF directory, specifically when processing colormap data with a crafted TIFF file. The `LogLuvClose()` function sets the bits per pixel to 16 without verifying the correctness of the photometric interpretation, leading to the overflow when `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagColormap` is called.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow in `_TIFFmemcpy`. Improper handling of photometric interpretation in the `LogLuvClose()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Denial of service (DoS) due to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted TIFF file is used to trigger the vulnerability when processed by `tiffcp` or similar tools.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted TIFF file to be processed by a vulnerable version of libtiff.
