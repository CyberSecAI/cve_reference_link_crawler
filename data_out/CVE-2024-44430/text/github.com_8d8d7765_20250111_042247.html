# ***\*XSS in SourceCodester Kortex Lite Advocate Office Management System 1.0 (register\_case.php)\****

***\*url\****：control/register\_case.php and control/case\_report.php

***\*Abstract\****:

Line 212 of register\_case.php sends unvalidated data to a web browser, which can result in the browser executing malicious code in case\_report.php at line 77-94.

***\*Explanation\****:

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:

Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of persistent (also known as stored) XSS, the untrusted source is typically a database or other back-end data store, while in the case of reflected XSS it is typically a web request.

In this case, the data enters at query() in register\_case.php at line 212.

[![1](/samwbs/kortexcve/raw/main/xss_register_case/img/1.png)](/samwbs/kortexcve/blob/main/xss_register_case/img/1.png)

The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated.

In this case, the data is sent in case\_report.php at line 77-94.

[![2](/samwbs/kortexcve/raw/main/xss_register_case/img/2.png)](/samwbs/kortexcve/blob/main/xss_register_case/img/2.png)

It is clear that the application doesn’t perform data validation and trust user-supplied data, we can use the below XSS payload as input which may be stored in the application.

<script>alert(1)</script>
