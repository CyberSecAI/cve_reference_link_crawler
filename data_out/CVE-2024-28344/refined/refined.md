Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE-2024-28344 - Open Redirect**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the `back` parameter in the URL when accessing the Old Admin Panel of the Sipwise C5 NGCP Dashboard.
