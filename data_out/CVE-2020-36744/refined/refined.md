  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-36744",
    "Description": "The NotificationX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the generate_conversions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate conversions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin's `generate_conversions()` function was not correctly validating the nonce, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Missing nonce validation",
       "Incorrect nonce validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker could trick a site administrator into performing actions, such as generating conversions, by submitting a forged request.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Forged request initiated by the attacker",
        "Social engineering to trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a link or performing an action that triggers the forged request. No other specific capabilities are required.",
        "Affected component": "NotificationX plugin's `generate_conversions()` function"
    }
