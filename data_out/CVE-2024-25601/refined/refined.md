- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Expando module when handling geolocation custom fields. Specifically, the name field of a geolocation custom field is vulnerable to injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to a variety of malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the web page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by injecting a crafted payload into the name text field of a geolocation custom field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. The attacker also needs to have access to the administration interface where custom fields are configured.
