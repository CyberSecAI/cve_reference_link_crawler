Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-27096

**Vulnerability Description:** SQL Injection in GLPI's search engine

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries in the search functionality. Specifically, it seems related to the handling of integer parameters in the search function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The core weakness is the injection of malicious SQL code through the search functionality. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query being executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Extraction:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Potential for other attacks**: While not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be used to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GLPI application.
*   **Low Privileges:** Only low privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of GLPI >= 0.65.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 10.0.13.
*   The issue is specifically triggered when using PHP 7.4, and is not present in PHP 8.0 and above.
*   The fix involves casting integer parameters in the search function to integers.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS v3 score of 7.7.
*   The vulnerability was reported by iarce-qb.

The patch `61a0c2302b4f633f5065358adc36058e1abc37f9` introduced the following changes to address the vulnerability in `src/Search.php`:
```diff
@@ -8025,6 +8025,22 @@ public static function manageParams(
    }
  }
 
+ $int_params = [
+  'sort'
+ ];
+
+ foreach ($params as $key => &$val) {
+  if (in_array($key, $int_params)) {
+   if (is_array($val)) {
+    foreach ($val as &$subval) {
+     $subval = (int)$subval;
+    }
+   } else {
+    $val = (int)$val;
+   }
+  }
+ }
+
  return $params;
  }

```

This code change forces the 'sort' parameter to be an integer to prevent SQL injection.
