  "CVE-2024-26633": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel's IPv6 tunnel functionality has a vulnerability in the `ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim` function when handling the NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT header. Specifically, when processing IPv6 extension headers, the code attempts to read the `frag_off` field of a fragment header without ensuring that enough bytes have been pulled into the skb's head buffer. This can lead to reading uninitialized memory.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a missing check for sufficient data before accessing the fragment offset within the `ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory read"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to read uninitialized memory, leading to a potential information leak. The syzbot report also indicates a KMSAN uninit-value bug.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered within the network stack when processing IPv6 packets with specific extension headers.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted IPv6 packets to a system with the affected kernel. The specific attacker position is not explicitly mentioned."
