Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect implementation of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Extreme Networks Switch EXOS Chalet Web GUI. Specifically, the web GUI performs client-side security checks instead of server-side, which allows unauthorized access to admin functionalities by manipulating HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient RBAC Enforcement:** The web GUI does not properly restrict access to administrator functionalities based on user roles.
- **Client-Side Security Checks:** Security checks are performed on the client-side within the Chalet Web GUI, making them easily bypassable.
- **Direct Access to Sensitive URLs:** Users can access administrative functions by directly browsing to the corresponding admin URLs, even if they are not linked from their user page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged (Read-Only) authenticated user can gain administrative privileges, allowing them to execute CLI commands and make configuration changes as an Admin user.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Read-only users can access sensitive administrative functions, such as file management, user account settings, and plugin management.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify sensitive data, delete files, and upload malicious files through the web interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Modified HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends modified HTTP requests with direct URLs to admin functionalities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target Extreme Networks switch.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the device with a read-only or low-privileged account.
- **Basic Web Interaction Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to inspect web page elements and send HTTP requests with a web browser or similar tools.
