{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `log` function uses `vsnprintf` to format log messages, and the format string parameter is derived from network inputs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Format string injection vulnerability in the UPnP logging functionality of the Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service. The vulnerability can leak stack memory and write arbitrary memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can host a malicious UPnP service to trigger these vulnerabilities by sending crafted M-SEARCH replies. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to send these packets",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. They must be capable of listening for and replying to M-SEARCH packets with a malicious response to trigger the vulnerability. This includes setting up a malicious UPnP service."
