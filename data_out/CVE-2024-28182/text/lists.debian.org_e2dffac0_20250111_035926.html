Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3804-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : nghttp2
Version        : 1.36.0-2+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-28182
Debian Bug     : 1068415

Bartek Nowotarskis discovered that nghttp2, a set of programs
implementing the HTTP/2, keeps reading CONTINUATION frames even after a
stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive
CPU usage to decode HPACK stream, which could lead to Denial of Service.

The issue is mitigated by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it
can accept after a HEADERS frame.  The limit is configurable and
defaults to 8.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.36.0-2+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nghttp2 packages.

For the detailed security status of nghttp2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
