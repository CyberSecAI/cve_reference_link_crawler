- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow in the `formQuickIndex` function due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `PPPOEPassword` parameter from a POST request.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The `PPPOEPassword` parameter is copied to a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper size validation. The `sub_4FDE4` function copies the input to the stack buffer without checking its size, potentially overflowing it.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can cause the device to crash or allow for complete control of the device.

- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with an overly long `PPPOEPassword` parameter to the `/goform/QuickIndex` endpoint.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Tenda AC15 router. This usually requires being on the same network as the router or having access to the router's web interface through other means. The attacker needs to know the target's IP address.
