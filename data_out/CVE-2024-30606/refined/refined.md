- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fromDhcpListClient` function in Tenda FH1203 V2.0.1.6 firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A user-controlled `page` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer allocated for local variable `v4` on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Overwriting the return address on the stack can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint with an oversized value for the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely requires network access to the router.
