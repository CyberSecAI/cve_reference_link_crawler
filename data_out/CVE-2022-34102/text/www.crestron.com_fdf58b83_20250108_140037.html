### Security at Crestron

Thousands of companies across hundreds of industries, government agencies, universities, and more have standardized on Crestron products. They trust and rely on Crestron to make their lives simpler and work/ education environments secure. Central to that success is Crestron's unwavering commitment to network security. Simply put, "If it's on the network, it must be secure." Clients need to know who and what is on their network.

##### Our Process

A secure system, of course, doesn't just happen. There are large number of considerations that need to be accounted for throughout the development process. Crestron allocates and dedicates resources to define the problem spaces and document the appropriate solutions.

Step 1 - Identifying risks that are applicable to the systems and identifying assumptions about the operating environment.

Step 2 - All source code is reviewed to ensure not only proper functionality, but also conformance to security guidelines.

Step 3 - Source code is subjected to scans using automated tools that review code for common errors and security holes.

Step 4 - A rigorous testing process is in place once the software/firmware is compiled and loaded into systems. Each night, the latest code is built and automated tests are run to ensure system stability. Included in these tests are standard network scanning tools to ensure there are no unauthorized ports, etc. which have been open.

##### Providing network security at the product level.

Enterprise IT departments categorize devices that don't support these features as a security risk.

* AES Encryption - Ensures secure transmissions. The same protocol banks use to protect transactions on the Internet.
* 802.1x Authentication - Ensures that every device on the network is explicitly authorized by the IT department.
* Active Directory® - Centralized credential management ensures that only authorized users gain access.
* JITC Certification - Crestron products have received approval by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) of the U.S. Department of Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and have been added to the Unified Capabilities (UC) Approved Products List (APL).
* PKI Authentication - Required when simple passwords are inadequate to confirm the identity of the parties involved in a particular action or communication, and to validate the information being transferred.

* TLS - The most widely used security protocol, TLS provides privacy and data integrity between two applications communicating over a network.
* SSH Network Protocol - Encrypts and protects communications, whereas Telnet, used in other Network AV products, does not.
* HTTPS - The secure version of HTTP, HTTPS encrypts the data sent between your web browser and the website you're connected to, ensuring the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data. The "S" at the end of HTTPS stands for "Secure."
* Secure CIP - Ensures communications between Crestron control processors and DM NVX devices are secure.

| 8/14/2019 12:00:00 AM | DM NVX 2.0 and Earlier Supports SNMP v1/2 | Unauthorized users can read all SNMP information because the access password is not secure in SNMPv1 or SNMPv2. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 have been designated as obsolete.  Versions of DM NVX prior to the released 2.1 supported these earlier versions. |  | Versions of DM NVX 2.0 and earlier supported these now obsolete versions of SNMP. While used in the industry for years, a number of security vendors now flag it with increasing severity. As a result, it has been removed from the 2.1 feature set. SNMP v3 will be a part of the DM NVX 2.2 release.  There is no reliable method to disable SNMP on the DM NVX device itself.  The easiest method to eliminate the potential risk is to update to DM NVX 2.1 or higher.   If you decide not to update:  * All exposed parameters on the DM NVX are Read Only, so an attacker is limited * The risk can be eliminated by blocking UDP traffic on ports 161 and 162 |  | NVX|SNMP |  |
| 9/18/2019 12:00:00 AM | Super Micro BMC Vulnerabilities Discovered | A vulnerability was disclosed affecting Super Micro’s BMC. Researchers have identified vulnerabilities in the Virtual Media function of Supermicro BMCs. BMC/IPMI Virtual Media is a feature of the Virtual Console that enables users to attach a CD/DVD image to the server as a virtual CD/DVD drive. These vulnerabilities include plaintext authentication, weak encryption, and authentication bypass within the Virtual Media capabilities. Identified by researchers in the lab, the vulnerabilities have not been reported in a customer environment. |  | This BMC is used in the DM-NVX Director products - DM-XIO-DIR-80, DM-XIO-DIR-160 and DM-XIO-DIR-ENT. By default, the BMC is only available from the management port.   Best practices are that the management port is only used for local connection and not connected to a wider LAN.

| 10/26/2017 12:00:00 AM | BLUEBORNE | It has been reported that a new attack vector called BlueBorne can potentially affect all devices with Bluetooth capabilities running major mobile, desktop, and IoT operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux. By spreading through the air, BlueBorne targets the weakest spot in the networks' defense – and the only one that no security measure protects. |  | The only Crestron device that currently exposes a Bluetooth interface is the Crestron Mercury Tabletop Conference System.  Mercury uses a BlueTooth module which incorporates a proprietary operating system (not Android, iOS, Windows or Linux) and therefore is not susceptible to the BlueBorne attack. Furthermore, all Bluetooth profiles are kept inactive during normal operation of the device, requiring explicit user intervention to enable paring and/or discovery to the device. As such, Mercury is not vulnerable to the BlueBorne attack vector. | [www.armis.com/blueborne](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/ "www.armis.com/blueborne/") | Mercury |  |

| 8/9/2018 12:00:00 AM | KRACK | It has been reported that there several vulnerabilities in the WiFi Protected Access II Protocol (WPA2).  The vulnerabilities make it possible for attackers to eavesdrop on WiFi traffic.  Please see the following CVE reports for additional information: CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, CVE-2017-13082, CVE-2017-13084, CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, and CVE-2017-13088. |  | This vulnerability is a protocol level vulnerability and as such affects nearly all correct implementations of the firmware.  The following devices are affected:   * CEN-WAP-1500 * CEN-WAP-ABG-1G * CEN-WAP-ABG-CM * TSR-302 - Resolved in Version 1.004.0007 * TST-602 - Resolved in Version 1.004.0007 * TST-902 - Resolved in Version 1.004.0007   Other Crestron WiFi products do not support WPA2 and as such are not affected.  If any of the CEN-WAP products are used with non-Crestron products, all unencrypted information should be considered at risk. Use HTTPS and other secure protocols until a fix is available.  Most traffic between the TSR-302, TST-602, TST-902 and the control system is over Crestron Extended Range 2.4 GHz RF (ER) and is thus unaffected. However, WiFi communications are used for some additional functions (such as video playback, intercom, etc.) and could be vulnerable. Crestron is actively working towards a fix.  If you are using a non-Crestron WAP you should also check with the vendor for updates.  A notable risk is that the following UI Applications use direct connections and could be intercepted and potentially spoofed:   * Media Player Object * All Pyng Objects * TV Presets Object   Two possible mitigations exist:   1. Remove the UI Applications from devices. 2. Disable WiFi on the Remotes. This will allow the UI Applications to still run but will disable other features (such as streaming video, intercom, graphics). Note that performance of the applications will also be affected.   It is recommended that all installations follow the Secure Deployment Guide found in Online Help ID 5571. This will enable additional encryption on the device. This will not remove the risk noted regarding the UI Applications by itself. |  | WiFi |  |

| 6/30/2016 12:00:00 AM | SSL 3.0 PROTOCOL VULNERABILITY | As per TA14-290A, all systems and applications utilizing the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 3.0 with cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode ciphers may be vulnerable. However, the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack demonstrates this vulnerability using web browsers and web servers, which is one of the most likely exploitation scenarios.  Later, this vulnerability was extended to certain TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 implementations. |  | 1. The most likely exploitation is via web browsers and servers, which is not a high use case on Crestron equipment. In addition, the exploitation is most commonly implemented as a Man-in-the-Middle attack which is also less likely given the way most Crestron systems are put together. 2. Crestron has deprecated support for SSL 3.0 and relies only on TLS which does not have this vulnerability. The console command "SSL" supports the following options: TLSSSL, TLSONLY, TLS1.2ONLY. 3. Crestron does implement the protocol extension, TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV, which prevents MITM attackers from being able to force a protocol downgrade. 4. Crestron's implementation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 was proven not to expose this vulnerability using the Qualys SSL Labs SSL Server test. | [Alert (TA14-290A) SSL 3.0 Protocol Vulnerability and POODLE Attack](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A "US-CERT")  [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ "SSL Server Test") | SSL |  |

As per CVE-2014-6332, OleAut32.dll in OLE in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by an array-redimensioning attempt that triggers improper handling of a size value in the SafeArrayDimen function, aka "Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" or WinShock. |  | All shipping products were reviewed and the following notes are applicable:   1. While Crestron 3-Series processors do use Windows Embedded operating systems, the kernel itself is different and it is not immediately clear if the same deficiency is present. We are working with Microsoft to make this determination. The Web Server in these processors does use SChannel for authentication if SSL is enabled. However, in most installations SSL is not enabled. This is further mitigated by the point that there is no scripting support provided on the 3-series web server and so exploitation would be more difficult. 2. Crestron is working with Microsoft regarding and update to Crestron RL. However, as this is an embedded system with code protection enabled it is not clear the vulnerability is exploitable. 3. Crestron is working with Microsoft regarding an update to the TPMC-V12, TPMC-V15, DGE-1. However, as this is an embedded system with code protection enabled, it is not clear the vulnerability is exploitable. 4. Customers running Fusion are urged to make sure to apply Windows updates. | [CVE-2014-6332 Detail](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6332 "NIST") | Microsoft|Windows |  |
