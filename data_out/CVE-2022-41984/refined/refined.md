Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-41984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a "protection mechanism failure" within some Intel Arc graphics cards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Protection Mechanism Failure:**  A flaw in the protection mechanisms of specific Intel Arc graphics cards (A770 and A750 Limited Edition) allows unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service condition, rendering the affected graphics card unusable or unstable.
* **Information Disclosure**: Though not directly related to CVE-2022-41984, the document mentions CVE-2022-38973 alongside it. CVE-2022-38973 mentions that information disclosure is also a potential impact, but it's tied to a different vulnerability (improper access control) and different preconditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable graphics card is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker must be a privileged user on the system to exploit the vulnerability. This is indicated by the CVSS vector "PR:H" (Privileges Required: High).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Intel Arc A770 and A750 Limited Edition graphics cards sold between October and December 2022.
*   **Mitigation:** Intel recommends contacting product support for assistance.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.4, categorized as medium severity.
*   **CVSS Vector:** The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attack requires local access.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
    *   **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker needs high privileges on the system.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is needed for the exploit.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability impacts only the affected component.
    *   **C:N (Confidentiality: None):** There is no impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** The attack can cause a significant loss of availability.
