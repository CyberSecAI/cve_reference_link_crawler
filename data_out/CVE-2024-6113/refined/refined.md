Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `login.php` file of the "Monbela Tourist In Online Reservation System Using PHP" project.
- This occurs because the application directly uses the `email` parameter from user input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the `email` parameter in the `login.php` file is vulnerable.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In some scenarios, attackers could achieve full system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the system's availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `email` parameter of the `login.php` file via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or login is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection is needed to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The provided GitHub issue includes proof-of-concept (POC) payloads, demonstrating boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The issue also provides screenshots of SQLMap tool results, further confirming the vulnerability's presence and exploitability.
- The issue suggests using prepared statements, input validation, and minimizing database user permissions as remediation steps.
- The vulnerability affects version 1.0 of the "Monbela Tourist In Online Reservation System Using PHP."
