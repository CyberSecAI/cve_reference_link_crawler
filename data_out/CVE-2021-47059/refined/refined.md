Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47059.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `sun8i_ss_hash_run` function within the `drivers/crypto/allwinner/sun8i-ss/sun8i-ss-hash.c` file, specifically on an error path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak. In the `sun8i_ss_hash_run` function, the allocated memory pointed to by `result` was not freed on a certain error path. This results in memory not being released back to the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The memory leak can lead to a denial-of-service due to the continuous consumption of memory. This can potentially destabilize the system or cause other system errors.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by operations that cause an error within the hash computation, leading to the described memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable `sun8i_ss_hash_run` function in such a way that an error occurs and the result memory is leaked. This likely means the attacker needs to be able to make use of the crypto subsystem and pass data to the sun8i-ss hash driver. This does not require local access.
