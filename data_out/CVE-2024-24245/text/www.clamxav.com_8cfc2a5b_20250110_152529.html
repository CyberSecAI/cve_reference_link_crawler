Totally rebuilt from the ground up

Completely new user interface but it should still feel familiar

Vastly improved, fully-integrated, log viewer

Reduced CPU usage of main app

You can run multiple scans at one time

Complete integration of all component parts (Main app, Sentry, Scheduling, Reports)

Smart source list which automatically displays all available volumes.

You can now have per-source-item scan settings

â¦along with different exclude settings per scan item

You can enable/disable quarantine per scan item

â¦ and even enable/disable quarantine during a scan

Weâve added copy & paste support for âexclude file settingsâ (between source list items as well as copying files from Finder)

If you quit ClamXAV, the scan will continue

All-new ClamXAV menu item which shows progress of all current scans and database updates

Thereâs so much more, but I think you get the gist. Itâs all new!
