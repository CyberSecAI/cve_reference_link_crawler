Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `id` parameter in the `edit.php` file of the Online Courseware application is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not properly sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability in the `edit.php` file.
- Lack of input sanitization on the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious script code into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to:
  - Taking control of the user's browser.
  - Stealing user information (e.g., session cookies, credentials).
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `id` parameter.
- The attacker can send this malicious URL to the victim, for example through email or social media.
- When the victim clicks on the link, the malicious script gets executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- They must be able to deliver this URL to a victim user of the application.
- No special privileges are needed on the server to carry out this attack.

**Technical Details**
- Affected page: `edit.php?id=XX`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `id`
- Payload example:  `"></script><script>alert(1)</script>`
- Example URL:  `http://localhost/onlinecourseware/pcci/admin/edit.php?id="></script><script>alert(1)</script>`
