# Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key in go-zero

Critical

published
GHSA-fgxv-gw55-r5fq
Mar 2, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/zeromicro/go-zero
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v1.4.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

Hello go-zero maintainer team, I would like to report a security concerning your CORS Filter feature.

### Details

Go-zero allows user to specify a [CORS Filter](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/blob/master/rest/internal/cors/handlers.go) with a configurable allows param - which is an array of domains allowed in CORS policy.

However, the `isOriginAllowed` uses `strings.HasSuffix` to check the origin, which leads to bypass via domain like `evil-victim.com`

```
func isOriginAllowed(allows []string, origin string) bool {
	for _, o := range allows {
		if o == allOrigins {
			return true
		}

		if strings.HasSuffix(origin, o) {
			return true
		}
	}

	return false
}
```
### PoC

Use code below as a PoC. Only requests from `safe.com` should bypass the CORS Filter

```
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/rest"
)

func main() {
	svr := rest.MustNewServer(rest.RestConf{Port: 8888}, rest.WithRouter(mockedRouter{}), rest.WithCors("safe.com"))
	svr.Start()
}

type mockedRouter struct{}

// some sensitive path
func (m mockedRouter) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// check user's cookie
	// ...
	// return sensitive data
	w.Write([]byte("social_id: 420101198008292930"))
}

func (m mockedRouter) Handle(_, _ string, handler http.Handler) error {
	return errors.New("foo")
}

func (m mockedRouter) SetNotFoundHandler(_ http.Handler) {
}

func (m mockedRouter) SetNotAllowedHandler(_ http.Handler) {
}
```

Send a request to localhost:8888 with `Origin:not-safe.com`

You can see the origin reflected in response, which bypass the CORS Filter

### Impact

This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy and thus allowing any page to make requests, retrieve data on behalf of other users.

### Severity

Critical

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
