The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of `strings.HasSuffix` in the `isOriginAllowed` function within the CORS filter implementation. This function checks if the origin of an incoming request ends with an allowed domain, which can be easily bypassed by using a domain like `evil-victim.com` when `victim.com` is in the allowed list.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation leading to authorization bypass. The CORS check allows subdomains to bypass the check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can bypass CORS policy, allowing any page to make requests and retrieve sensitive data on behalf of other users. This could include session information or any other data exposed by the API.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions as an authenticated user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- The attacker crafts a request with an "Origin" header that is a suffix of the allowed domains.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges required
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
