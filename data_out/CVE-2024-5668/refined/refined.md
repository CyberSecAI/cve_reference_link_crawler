    - User redirection to malicious sites
    - Data theft through keylogging or form hijacking
    - Website defacement
    - Privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via the injection of malicious scripts into HTML data attributes of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This implies that an account with the privileges to create or modify content is required.
