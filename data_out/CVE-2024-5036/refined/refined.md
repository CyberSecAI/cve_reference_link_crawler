Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5036

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Sina Extension for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the 'url' parameter, likely associated with image or link fields within the plugin's widgets, is not properly sanitized. This allows users to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored in the database and executed when a page using the vulnerable widget is loaded by any user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a DOM-Based Stored XSS. The injected script is stored in the database and rendered in the user's browser when viewing the affected page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 'url' parameter before storing it in the database.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin also fails to properly escape the stored data when rendering the page, allowing the malicious script to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into pages.
- **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation could lead to account compromise by stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website by injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's settings interface.
- A user with Contributor level access or higher can inject malicious JavaScript via the vulnerable fields within the Elementor page builder interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access.
- **Elementor Access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify pages using the Elementor page builder.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know where to inject the malicious script (likely image/link 'url' parameters within the plugin's widgets).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Sina Extension for Elementor plugin up to and including version 3.5.4.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.5.5.
- The vulnerable code appears to be in multiple widgets including, but not limited to the following:
    - sina-counter.php
    - sina-flip-box.php
    - sina-google-map.php
    - sina-pricing.php
    - sina-progressbar.php
    - sina-social-icons.php
    - sina-table.php
    - sina-team.php
    - sina-video.php
   - sina-blogpost.php
   - sina-brand-carousel.php
- The fix involves escaping the user-supplied URLs in the templates to prevent script execution.
