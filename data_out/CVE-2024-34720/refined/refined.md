{
  "CVE-2024-34720": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the native layer of Zygote didn't properly verify the UID of incoming connections when a 'non-fork' command was received, causing it to exit the native loop and let the Java layer handle the command, bypassing UID checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of UID in the native layer of Zygote for non-fork commands.",
      "Lack of consistency in UID checks between the native and Java layers."
    ],
    "impact": "Local escalation of privilege. An application with access to a zygote socket could potentially connect to another app zygote socket, bypassing the intended access control, and potentially performing privileged actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An application running on the device could exploit this if it had access to the (random) socket address of another app zygote and connect to it, bypassing security checks.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an application running on the device and the capability to access the socket address of another app zygote."
  }
