# Privilege escalation through CSRF attack on 'setup.pl'

High

[ehuelsmann](/ehuelsmann)
published
GHSA-98ff-f638-qxjm
Feb 2, 2024

## Package

LedgerSMB

## Affected versions

1.3.0-1.3.47,1.4.0-1.4.42,1.5.0-1.5.30,1.6.0-1.6.33,1.7.0-1.7.32,1.8.0-1.8.31,1.9.0-1.9.30,1.10.0-1.10.29,1.11.0-1.11.8

## Patched versions

1.10.30, 1.11.9

## Description

# Summary:

When a LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl,

an attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically

submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent. This request can

be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl)

privileges, leading to privilege escalation.

# Known vulnerable:

All of:

* 1.3.0 up to 1.3.47 (including)
* 1.4.0 up to 1.4.42 (including)
* 1.5.0 up to 1.5.30 (including)
* 1.6.0 up to 1.6.33 (including)
* 1.7.0 up to 1.7.32 (including)
* 1.8.0 up to 1.8.31 (including)
* 1.9.0 up to 1.9.30 (including)
* 1.10.0 up to 1.10.29 (including)
* 1.11.0 up to 1.11.8 (including)

# Known fixed:

* 1.10.30
* 1.11.9

# Details:

CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It

inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function

on the victim’s behalf [1](#user-content-fn-1-b6cf7eccfe0e9dd3628e38be9f307a84).

To successfully perform the attack, an attacker needs to know the name of the database

for which they want to create a user. That is: in case LedgerSMB is used to maintain

multiple company administrations, multiple attacks need to be performed to gain access

to all of them. A single attack will gain access to a single company only, however, if

companies share users, the attacker can use those to gain access to the other companies

with the rights of the affected user accounts.

In this specific attack, the victim must be an administrator of /setup.pl with an

active session. It should be noted that the resulting user does *not* have full

access to /setup.pl, but *does* have full access to /login.pl for a single company.

This means that the resulting user can therefore *not* be used to create database backups,

however the attack itself can be used by the attacker to perform any action supported

by setup.pl.

# Recommendations:

We recommend all users to upgrade to known-fixed versions. Versions

prior to 1.10 are end-of-life and will not receive security fixes from

the LedgerSMB project.

Users who cannot upgrade, may apply the included patches or are advised

to contact a vendor for custom support.

As a workaround, installations may choose not to expose and use /setup.pl,

instead using the command line application "ledgersmb-admin" to perform

administrative tasks. Password resets can be performed with regular

/login.pl functionality or through PostgreSQL's "psql" command line tool.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
