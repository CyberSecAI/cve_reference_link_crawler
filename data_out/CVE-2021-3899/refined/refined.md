Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-3899:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in `apport`, the crash reporting tool in Ubuntu. `Apport` checks if a process has been replaced after a crash by comparing the start time of the crashed process with the start time of `apport` itself. However, an attacker can reuse the process ID (PID) of the crashed process right after `apport` launches, resulting in the start times being the same, bypassing `apport`'s check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is the race condition that exists between the time `apport` starts and the time a new process reuses a recently released PID.
*   **Insufficient PID Reuse Check:** The check performed by `apport` to detect if a process has been replaced is insufficient, relying solely on comparing start times.
*   **Insecure Core File Handling:**  Due to the bypassed check, `apport` can drop a core file in an attacker-controlled directory (e.g., `/etc/logrotate.d/` via sudo) instead of the designated location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain root privileges. This is achieved by exploiting the race condition to make `apport` drop a core file in a directory where a root process is later executed by an attacker. This allows them to potentially overwrite files or execute arbitrary code as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Process Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate processes, including creating processes, causing crashes, and reusing PIDs.
*   **Sudo or Sendmail:** The exploit can be triggered via `sudo` if a user is allowed to run a command as root. Alternatively the presence of the `sendmail` package may also be a trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target system.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands.
*   **Sudo Rights (Conditional):** In one exploit scenario, the attacker needs to be able to execute a specific command via `sudo` as root.
*   **Timing:** The exploit depends on precise timing to win the race condition and reuse the process ID after the crash.

**More Details than CVE:**

*   The provided content contains a detailed description of how the race condition is exploited, particularly how a PID can be reused in a way that bypasses the `apport` check.
*   It provides concrete examples with `sudo ping` and a directory (`/etc/logrotate.d`) for exploiting this vulnerability.
*   The content mentions that an initial patch addressed the location where core files are dropped, but the race condition itself was not eliminated and the issue was further addressed with an additional update.
*   The launchpad bug report provides the patch information, discussion between developers, and a proof-of-concept.
