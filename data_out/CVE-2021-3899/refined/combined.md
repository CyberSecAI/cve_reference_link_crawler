## Details

Muqing Liu and neoni discovered that Apport incorrectly handled detecting

if an executable was replaced after a crash. A local attacker could

possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code as the root user.

([CVE-2021-3899](/security/CVE-2021-3899))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled connections to

Apport sockets inside containers. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to connect to arbitrary sockets as the root user. ([CVE-2022-1242](/security/CVE-2022-1242))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled user settings

files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2022-28652](/security/CVE-2022-28652))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of logging

from D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

fill up the Apport log file, leading to denial of service. ([CVE-2022-28654](/security/CVE-2022-28654))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not filter D-Bus connection

strings. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Apport to

make arbitrary network connections. ([CVE-2022-28655](/security/CVE-2022-28655))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not limit the amount of memory

being consumed during D-Bus connections. A local attacker could possibly

use this issue to cause Apport to consume memory, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2022-28656](/security/CVE-2022-28656))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport did not disable the python crash

handler before chrooting into a container. A local attacker could possibly

use this issue to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2022-28657](/security/CVE-2022-28657))

Gerrit Venema discovered that Apport incorrectly handled filename argument

whitespace. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof

arguments to the Apport daemon. ([CVE-2022-28658](/security/CVE-2022-28658))

### Bug Description

Hello. I'm Muqing Liu @Singurlar Security Lab. I would like to report a vulnerability that lead to Local Privilege Escalation. I found this vurlnebiltiy together with neoni

An attacker can use this vulnerability to get a root shell, if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1. If an unprivilieged user ( e.g. nobody ) is allowed to run a command (e.g. ping) as root via sudo.

2. Or `sendmail` package is installed on system (It's may possible but I have not tested.)

Here is the detail:

Apport will check if pid is reused, by check if the start time of the process is later than apport self:

  # /usr/share/apport/apport

  594 apport\_start = get\_apport\_starttime()

  595 process\_start = get\_process\_starttime()

  596 if process\_start > apport\_start:

  597 error\_log('process was replaced after Apport started, ignoring')

  598 sys.exit(0)

But an attacker could reused pid just after apport launched. In such case, get\_apport\_starttime() == get\_process\_starttime().

So, an attacker can get root shell under Condition 1, by following steps.

1. prepare a process X to crash, whose pid is A

2. repeating fork process, until current pid reaches A - 2

3. make process X crash, apport will be launched by kernel with pid A - 1. Then attacker kill process X, so pid A is now available.

4. attacker run command `sudo ping 8.8.8.8` with current directory /etc/logrotate.d/. a process running under root:root will re-occupy pid A.

5. Since the start time of sudo and apport are same, line 596 is by-passed. Apport then drop a core file of process X in /etc/logrotate.d

For Condtion 2:

Sudo will execute sendmail to send incident report if sendmail is installed. So arbitrary user can run sudo to trigger sendmail at /etc/logrotate.d. I have not tested this case, but I think it's possible to win the race.

PoC of Condition 1 is attached.

Hi,

Yes, we were working on an Apport update when you filed this bug. The update happens to prevent the privilege escalation your proof-of-concept uses.

But the race condition you found is still there which may allow fooling Apport into using the wrong UID/GID. Though, I'm not sure how it could be used to actually escalate privileges now.

We will work on another Apport update soon which will attempt to harden this further. We will update this bug once we have a fix ready and are ready to propose a public date.

Thanks!

Since we can't totally eliminate the race condition, our current plan is to add an additional check in our next update to make sure the process uid/gid match the ones provided by the kernel. To do so, we need to change the way apport processes the command line, and this has an impact on apport usage inside containers that will require extensive testing.

Since this issue is mitigated by the current Apport versions, we haven't had a chance to test these scenarios yet. Work on this will resume in January. Apologies in the delay in making this issue public.

Here's the current state of the changes to attempt to improve the issue listed in this bug.

While there's no way to completely eliminate the race condition, I think we can make things better by switching over to using non-positional arguments, getting the real UID and GID from the kernel and making sure they match the process.

Switching over to non-positional arguments is going to require a lot of testing to make sure the patched Apport will work with older versions of Apport in containers, and vice-versa.
