```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cosign creates slices based on the number of signatures, manifests, or attestations in untrusted artifacts. An attacker can control the amount of memory that Cosign allocates by crafting a malicious artifact with an excessive number of signatures, manifests or attestations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
    "Denial of service"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A maliciously crafted software artifact can cause denial of service of the machine running Cosign, thereby impacting all services on the machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can create a malicious container image or artifact with an excessive number of signatures, manifests, or attestations. When Cosign processes this artifact, it allocates an excessive amount of memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute container images or artifacts that Cosign will process."
