# @valtimo/components exposes access token to form.io

Critical

[theo-ritense](/theo-ritense)
published
GHSA-xcp4-62vj-cq3r
May 13, 2024

## Package

npm

@valtimo/components
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 10.8.4
>= 11.0.0, < 11.1.6
>= 11.2.0, < 11.2.2

## Patched versions

10.8.4
11.1.6
11.2.2

## Description

### Impact

When opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user.

This issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.

### Attack requirements

The following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:

* An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain.
* The content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker.
* An attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API.
* An attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.

### Patches

Versions 10.8.4, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2 have been patched

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

- Set Formio's `projectUrl` and `authUrl to the current origin, so that api.form.io no longer is used as a default.
- Set the user in Formio so that the `/current` endpoint is no longer called.
