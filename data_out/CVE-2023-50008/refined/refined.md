{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Memory leaks were identified in the `colorcorrect` filter of FFmpeg due to improper deallocation of memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak",
      "Improper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "The memory leaks can cause the application to consume more and more memory over time, eventually leading to performance degradation, instability, or even a crash if memory resources are exhausted.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing specific media files using the `colorcorrect` filter within FFmpeg.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft or manipulate media files that trigger the `colorcorrect` filter within FFmpeg. No specific privileges or attacker position are specified, but it would require the user or process to process the malicious media file.",
    "additional_details": "The memory leak occurs specifically when allocating memory for `analyzeret`, `uhistogram`, and `vhistogram` within the `config_input` function, which is not freed during deinitialization.\n\nThe fix involves adding `av_freep` calls in the `uninit` function to free the allocated memory for `s->analyzeret`, `s->uhistogram`, and `s->vhistogram`. This ensures that the memory is released when the filter is no longer needed, thus resolving the memory leak."
