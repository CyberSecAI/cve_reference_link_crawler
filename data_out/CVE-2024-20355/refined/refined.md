- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper separation of authorization domains when using SAML authentication in Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper authorization domain separation when using SAML authentication. Specifically, an attacker can reuse a SAML SSO token obtained from one tunnel group for authentication with another tunnel group.
- **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to establish a remote access VPN session using a connection profile (tunnel group) that they are not authorized to use. This grants the attacker unauthorized access to secured networks behind the affected device.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack involves intercepting a valid SAML SSO token after initial authentication with a designated tunnel group and then re-submitting the same token to a different, unauthorized tunnel group.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs valid remote access VPN user credentials to authenticate initially and must be able to intercept the SAML SSO token. They also need to be able to submit this token to a different tunnel group.
