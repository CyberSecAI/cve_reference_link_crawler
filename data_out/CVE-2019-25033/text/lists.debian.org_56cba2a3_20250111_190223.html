Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Unbound, a validating,
recursive, caching DNS resolver, by security researchers of X41 D-SEC located
in Aachen, Germany. Integer overflows, assertion failures, an out-of-bound
write and an infinite loop vulnerability may lead to a denial-of-service or
have a negative impact on data confidentiality.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.9.0-2+deb10u2~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound1.9 packages.

For the detailed security status of unbound1.9 please refer to
