{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SRS real-time video server allows users to specify a server IP address for connection, without proper validation or filtering, which leads to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The application makes external requests based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can make the server perform requests to arbitrary internal or external systems. This can be used to probe internal networks, gain unauthorized access to services, or cause denial-of-service attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the 'server IP' input field in the SRS console. An attacker can insert a malicious URL or IP address into this field, which will then be used by the server to make an external request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the SRS console, which is typically a web interface. No specific privileges are mentioned. The attacker requires network access to the target server to trigger the SSRF."
