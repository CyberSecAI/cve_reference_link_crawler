Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-5831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The new sidebar in GitLab performs a version check unconditionally, regardless of the user's administrative status or whether version checks are enabled for the instance.
- This check involves calling `version.gitlab.com`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** If the `super_sidebar_logged_out` feature flag is enabled on a public GitLab instance, the version of the GitLab instance is exposed in the DOM, even to logged-out/anonymous users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can discover the specific GitLab version being used. This information can be used to target known vulnerabilities specific to that version.
- The leak occurs because the version check call is made even for unauthenticated users when `super_sidebar_logged_out` is enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability if the `super_sidebar_logged_out` feature flag is enabled. They simply need to browse to a public GitLab instance with the vulnerable configuration.
- **Network request:** The attacker would observe the network requests or the DOM to determine the GitLab instance version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to access the public GitLab instance where the `super_sidebar_logged_out` feature flag is enabled.
- No special privileges are required.
- They need to be able to examine the network requests or DOM to see the leaked version.

**Additional Details:**

- The `super_sidebar_logged_out` feature flag is disabled by default.
- The vulnerability is considered a "minor security risk".
