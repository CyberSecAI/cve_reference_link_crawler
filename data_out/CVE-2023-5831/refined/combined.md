# Prevent calling version.gitlab.com from the new sidebar

The new sidebar does a version check unconditionally. Normally a version check should only be executed, if the current user is an admin *and* the instance has version checks enabled.

This is minor security risk, if the instance also has the `super_sidebar_logged_out` feature flag enabled. On public GitLab instances the version of the GitLab instance would be leaked in the DOM, if a logged-out /anonymous user browses the instance. The feature flag is currently still disabled by default.

See <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-sirt/shared-incidents/incident_4462/-/issues/1> (more details will be added here later)
