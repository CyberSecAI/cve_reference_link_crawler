Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `send_digest` function in Discourse being accessible via a GET request. This allowed the possibility of embedding malicious URLs that would trigger the digest email to be sent, potentially leaking private information contained within the digest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of potentially private information through the digest email.
- **Insecure HTTP Method:** The use of a GET request for `send_digest` allowed for easier exploitation via crafted URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to private information contained within an admin's digest email by embedding malicious URLs in other locations. This could expose topic titles, excerpts, or other sensitive information from private topics.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** An attacker could craft a URL pointing to the vulnerable `send_digest` endpoint and embed it in various locations accessible to the admin user. When the admin clicks the link, or the browser tries to load an image/iframe with this url as source, the digest will be sent to the attacker (email address specified in the url).
- **Local Access:** As specified in the CVSS vector, the attack vector is local. This is likely from an admin user being tricked into clicking the crafted URL within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges on the Discourse system (PR:N).
-  The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious URL (UI:R).
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the `send_digest` endpoint and how to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit information shows the fix for this vulnerability: changing the `send_digest` endpoint from accepting GET requests to POST requests.
- The commit also includes a test case that validates the fix.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.5.

In summary, CVE-2022-23546 allowed for potential information disclosure by exploiting the way Discourse's `send_digest` endpoint handled GET requests. The fix involved changing the endpoint to only accept POST requests, mitigating the risk of malicious URL exploitation.
