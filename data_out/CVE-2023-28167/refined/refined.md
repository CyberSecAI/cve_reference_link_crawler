- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress CF7 Invisible reCAPTCHA plugin, in versions 1.3.3 and earlier, lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the presence of a CSRF vulnerability. This allows an attacker to induce higher-privileged users into performing actions that the attacker desires.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact will vary depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions being triggered by the attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves leveraging a crafted request from a malicious website or other source which, when executed by an authenticated user, will perform actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves. The user must have privileges to perform an action the attacker desires, the plugin itself has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.
