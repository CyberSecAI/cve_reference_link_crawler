The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47024.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs when closing a vsock socket due to queued packets not being freed from the RX queue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Packets in the RX queue of a vsock socket are not freed when the socket is closed, leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly creating and closing vsock sockets without freeing the RX queue can lead to memory exhaustion and potentially denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Closing vsock sockets: Triggering the socket closing mechanism without properly releasing resources can cause the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and close vsock sockets.
