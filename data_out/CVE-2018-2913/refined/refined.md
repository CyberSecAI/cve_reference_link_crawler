{
  "CVE-2018-2913": {
    "Root cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Oracle GoldenGate Manager due to insufficient bounds checking when processing a long, unauthenticated command.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the Oracle GoldenGate Manager.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted, overly long command via TCP to the GoldenGate Manager's listening port (7809).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the target system hosting the GoldenGate Manager. No prior authentication or credentials are required."
