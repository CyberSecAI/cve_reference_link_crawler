### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to missing authorization checks within the `conditionsRow` and `switchCountdown` functions of the Countdown, Coming Soon, Maintenance â€“ Countdown & Clock plugin.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization:** The `conditionsRow` and `switchCountdown` functions lack proper capability checks, allowing authenticated users with subscriber-level access or higher to access these functions.
- **PHP Object Injection:** The missing authorization makes it possible to inject PHP objects through the vulnerable functions, and potentially modify the status of countdowns.

### Impact of exploitation
- **PHP Object Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary PHP objects, potentially leading to various malicious activities like data manipulation, denial of service or remote code execution.
- **Modification of Countdown Status:** Attackers can modify the status of countdowns, potentially disrupting the intended functionality of the plugin.

### Attack vectors
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attack requires an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid WordPress account with subscriber-level or higher privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.

### Additional notes
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.7.8.
- The issue is located in the Ajax.php file of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.8.1 by adding a capability check in `conditionsRow` function.
