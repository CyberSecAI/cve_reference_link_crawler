Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-34050

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization in Spring AMQP.
-  Specifically, the `SimpleMessageConverter` or `SerializerMessageConverter` classes are vulnerable if no allowed list patterns for deserializable class names are configured, thus allowing deserialization of any class by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:**  The application can deserialize arbitrary classes from untrusted sources if no allowed list is provided for class names. This can lead to remote code execution.
- **Lack of Default Protection:** By default, Spring AMQP does not enforce a whitelist of allowed classes, making applications vulnerable out-of-the-box if the default settings are used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An attacker can craft malicious messages that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server running the Spring AMQP application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Message Injection:** An attacker with the ability to write messages to the RabbitMQ broker, which the vulnerable application consumes, can inject malicious serialized objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to RabbitMQ:** The attacker needs the ability to send messages to the RabbitMQ broker that the vulnerable Spring AMQP application is connected to.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to know that the target application does not enforce allowed list patterns for deserialization and use either `SimpleMessageConverter` or `SerializerMessageConverter`.
