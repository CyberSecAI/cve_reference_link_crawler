[ProfileGrid](https://profilegrid.co/) is a power-packed user profile, member, community and directory plugin. While ProfileGrid is fundamentally a user profile builder, it also offers User Groups. Groups are equivalent to Profile types where you can have different profile structures for different group of users. Advantages of Group based system is apparent from the very beginning:

* You can have multiple User Profile types.
* Each Group can have its own set of fields.
* Each Group can have its own Group Manager or Moderator.
* Group Manager can have special privacy level for group members.
* Each group can have its own registration workflow.
* You can offer visitors option to sign up or request membership for Group of their choice.
* Groups can have membership limits.
* Groups can be mapped to a specific WordPress Roles.
* Filter user profiles based on groups on directories page.
* Groups can be Open (public) or Closed (private)
* Closed Groups require membership approval from Group Manager or site Admin
* Users can join multiple Groups

And so much more!

If you do not need multiple Groups, there’s nothing stopping you to use the default Group as single profile type, membership or as user directories system. It’s a unique WordPress profile plugin that’s flexible and modular. A lot of stuff can be turned on or off by single click.

ProfileGrid is pretty both on the frontend and the dashboard area. We understand you spend a lot of time inside the dashboard, therefore, we made sure the admin facing interface is clean and organized. You will absolutely love it when you first log into ProfileGrid. And it looks even better once profiles start to fill in!

With release of version 4.1.0 we have added a bunch of new shortcodes which offer amazing amount of flexibility with displaying different types of user groups and user profiles data inside your WordPress theme and widgets. Brand new content enclosure shortcodes allow you to take control of content restrictions and membership access to granular level. Using new dynamic content shortcodes you can create personalized content for your users.

Start off, I have tried many membership plugins if they had a free version or trial. All were very frustrating hard to configure or too many errors. Until, from reading post from Divi Elegant Themes my theme of choice, I saw ProfileGrid listed. Downloaded and right off the bat, I was so impressed. User friendly many features in the free version to get started with. There were 2 issues that support help me with, which were my fault but they were gracious, kind and didn’t stop with offering any assistance I needed. Plus there are many free addons like RegistrationMagic you can install. Or like me, I like everything so I bought the unlimited lifetime license. Such a deal!!!
Thank you to the team at Metagauss for taking ProfileGrid to a new level and fixed everything wrong with the competition. I am truly grateful.

I changed this review after finding additional functionality.ORIGINALI bought the pro version, primarily to manage user access to different areas of a Support Knowledgebase. But 99% of my site is BetterDocs and I can’t find a way to include ProfileGrid’s access control on these pages? It looks like it only works with default posts and pages, and it’s own blog? I had hoped to use this with LifterLMS, but if it doesn’t work with custom content types, it isn’t very useful.
REVISEDThere is a shortcode to show and hide content. Although this is more work than an automatic solution, it’s more flexible. I set “log in to see more content” for Guests, and set the remaining content to display for the group. The benefit of this method is that I can put tempting teasers with SEO to show to Google. I like the shortcodes, as they are easy to manage and work with everything. I discovered that it caused a display problem with images and galleries, so they might not work with all content types.
If you are using BetterDocs specifically, it has an internal knowledgebase what has access control for entire sections.

I have been incredibly impressed with the ProfileGrid plugin! The functionality is fantastic, and it has made building my website so much easier. I’m especially thrilled with the Geolocation feature, which has added a valuable layer of usability to my platform, helping users easily connect with therapy dog teams across Germany.
The support team has been nothing short of exceptional. They were quick to respond and went above and beyond to assist me with my project. It’s rare to find such a dedicated and responsive support system, and it makes all the difference.
Overall, I highly recommend ProfileGrid for anyone looking for a powerful and reliable solution for creating user profiles and communities. This plugin truly delivers!
