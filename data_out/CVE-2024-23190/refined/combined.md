3 Bugs fixed since previous Public Release

This section provides a summary of bug fixes and changes that have been applied subsequently to
shipping Patch Release #6266.

MWB-2430 Node unresponsive with high RAM usage, no login possible
Possible endless attempts to delete the same items when a calendar folder is cleared.
This has been solved by not retrying to delete the same events repeatedly when clearing a folder.

OXUIB-2704 Missing contact in compose auto-complete
Exceeded the specified limit for the number of items returned breaks exact comparison to identify
incomplete results.
This has been fixed by using ”equal or greater than”.

MWB-2453 ”Invalid E-Mail address” when Searching in Address Book
Unexpected error when handing down search query with wildcards into LDAP mapping for distri-
bution lists.
Solution: Transfer search query as display name to distribution list entries.

OXUIB-2650 Sharing options of personal address book disabled
Was caused by misleading labels.
This has been solved by better UI error handling and improved labels (public link).

Release Notes for Patch Release #6268

OXUIB-2693 Context/User level logout location config
Check for HTTPS logout location.
Solution: Allow HTTP logout location. Note: It is not recommended. Https should be preferred.

MWB-2414 Data export does not work on S3-Filestore(s)
Lowercase ”content-length” header re-inserted for S3 CopyObjectRequest under certain circum-
stances.
This has been solved by using default object metadata when initializing CopyObjectRequest.

MWB-2420 Incorrectly formatted sender addresses lead to invalid sieve rules
Empty address string advertised on corrupt address.
Don’t advertise an empty address string on a corrupt address to solve this issue.

DOCS-5165 xls template with mixed language
Was caused by an incomplete translation.
This has been solved by correcting the missing header entries.

4 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully verified, are marked as such.

To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on
both, a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration
testing. All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless
explicitly stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.
