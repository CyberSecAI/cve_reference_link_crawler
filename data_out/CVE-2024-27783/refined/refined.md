- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities exist in FortiAIOps.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (CWE-352)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform arbitrary actions on behalf of an authenticated user by tricking the victim to execute malicious GET requests. This includes unauthorized access control, potentially leading to compromised confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker leverages CSRF by crafting malicious GET requests and tricking an authenticated user into executing them, without the user's knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce an authenticated user to click a link or load a webpage containing the malicious request. They do not need to authenticate to the application.
