## Description

The `PaperCut Mobility Print` version 1.0.3512 application allows an
unauthenticated attacker to perform a CSRF attack on an instance
administrator to configure the clients host (in the "configure printer
discovery" section). This is possible because the application has no
protections against CSRF attacks, like Anti-CSRF tokens, header origin
validation, samesite cookies, etc.

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability occurs because the application has no protections
against CSRF attacks, like Anti-CSRF tokens, header origin validation,
samesite cookies, etc.

## Exploitation

In this scenario an unauthenticated attacker to perform a CSRF attack
on an instance administrator to configure the clients host (in the
"configure printer discovery" section).

Then, when the administrator wants to share the link to users so that
they can configure their credentials, they are actually sending users
to a malicious website that pretends to be the PaperCut NG login, with
the goal of exfiltrating the credentials.
