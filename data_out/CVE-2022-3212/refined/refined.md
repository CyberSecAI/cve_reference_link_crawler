Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing request size limit within the `axum-core` crate when handling HTTP request bodies. Specifically, the `<bytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request` function did not enforce any default limit on the size of the request body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Request Size Limit:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a maximum size limit for incoming request bodies. This allows an attacker to send requests with excessively large `Content-Length` headers, even if the actual request body is small.
- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:**  The lack of a size limit leads to unbounded memory allocation by the Rust allocator, as the system tries to allocate memory according to the attacker-provided `Content-Length`.
- **Vulnerable Extractors:** The vulnerability extends to other extractors within `axum` that use `Bytes::from_request` internally, including `axum::extract::Form`, `axum::extract::Json`, and `String`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a denial of service attack. By sending requests with large `Content-Length` headers, they can cause the server to allocate excessive memory, potentially leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition. This OOM condition results in a process crash, making the server unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with manipulated `Content-Length` headers.
- **Direct Request Injection:** Attackers can also directly inject a malicious request payload containing a large `Content-Length`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. This means they must have network access to the server.
- The attacker must have the ability to craft HTTP requests with an arbitrary `Content-Length` header.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix implemented in the patched versions of `axum-core` introduces a default request body size limit of 2MB.
-   The vulnerability also affects the `axum` crate as it depends on `axum-core`.
