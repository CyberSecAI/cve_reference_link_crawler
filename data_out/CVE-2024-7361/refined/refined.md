Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Tracking/Monitoring Management System`. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the `/ajax.php?action=save_establishment` URI is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`id` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, potentially allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. In this context the impact is explicitly mentioned as "true" for Escalation of Privileges.
*   **Full control over database:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to a full compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to the `/ajax.php?action=save_establishment` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated 'id' parameter:** The SQL injection is achieved by manipulating the `id` parameter with malicious SQL code within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and how to craft them.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of SQL to construct the malicious payloads is required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided information includes a `sqlmap` command to test the vulnerability: `sqlmap -r a.txt -p id --batch --banner --flush-session`.
* The `a.txt` file provides a sample HTTP request demonstrating the vulnerable POST request, which includes the necessary parameters.
* The affected product is "Tracking/Monitoring Management System" version 1.0 from SourceCodester.
* The vulnerability was submitted to VulDB by user `topsky979`.
