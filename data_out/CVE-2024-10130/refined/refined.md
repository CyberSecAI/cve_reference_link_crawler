Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetRebootTimer` function of the Tenda AC8v4 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The `formSetRebootTimer` function in `/goform/SetSysAutoRebbotCfg`  takes a `rebootTime` parameter from a POST request.
*   The `rebootTime` parameter is passed to the function `FUN_004a8838` where `sscanf` parses the time string into `local_18` and `local_14`.
*   The `sscanf` function is vulnerable because it does not check the size of the input (`rebootTime`) against the buffer it is writing into (`local_18`, `local_14`). A long `rebootTime` string can overwrite the stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the router.
*   It's implied that more advanced exploitation may be possible given it's a stack overflow but that is not mentioned explicitly in the provided materials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is initiated through an HTTP POST request to `/goform/SetSysAutoRebbotCfg`.
*   The attacker needs to include the `rebootTime` parameter with a malicious string that causes a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router (potentially requiring network access to the device).
*   The attacker can be remote (as stated in the vuldb submission)
*   The specific requirements are not explicitly defined, but the PoC shows sending the crafted HTTP request.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Tenda AC8v4 firmware version V16.03.34.06.
*   The exploit is publicly disclosed (as shown by the Github link).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Professor Wei Zhou's team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
* The provided POC shows a python script which sends an HTTP POST request to trigger the overflow.
