| In v2.10.0, I've observed an issue where the request body passed to `.SetBody(...)` is intermittently written multiple times under certain conditions.  From what I gather, it is somehow related to the retry mechanism, or at the very least I was only able to reproduce by triggering that.  [In the repro here](https://github.com/patrikeh/resty-request-body-issue), I ping an httptest mock endpoint triggering the retry mechanism, and observe the JSON request body being written multiple consecutive times e.g.  ``` { <some-json> }{ <some-json> }  ```  This issue does not occur in v2.9.1. |
