# Vulnerability Report: GO-2023-2328

* CVE-2023-45286, GHSA-xwh9-gc39-5298
* Affects:
  github.com/go-resty/resty/v2
* Published: Nov 27, 2023
* Modified: May 20, 2024

A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body disclosure across requests.
This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same \*bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request.
The sync.Pool in question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server could receive the request body.

This fixes [#743](https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/743), possibly [#739](https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/739).

Discovered this while tracking down an issue in <https://github.com/linode/terraform-provider-linode>.

The removed call to sync.Pool.Put is handled by the request body wrapper that puts the buffer back in the pool when the body is closed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This closes [#739](https://github.com/go-resty/resty/issues/739) as well.  Now that I’m thinking about it, this is a security issue, as it’s disclosing a HTTP body to an unrelated endpoints/servers. |

| Yeah we are moving. Not only is the CVE a big problem, after the update to 2.10 we experienced fun bugs where the json request body of a previous or the same request (could not tell) was copied in the host part of the request URL. This occurred when multiple request were running concurrently and we changed nothing but the resty upgrade. Was fine for two years. I cannot prove it as I could not recreate the bug but a downgrade to 2.9.1 immediately solved the problem.  It could be a side effect of this buffer problem but as i cannot prove it i won't open a new thread. Just wanted to state it if somebody else experiences something different and has more time at hands to test it through.  Here is an example log from our kibana:  ``` 2023/11/28 13:51:16.736214 WARN RESTY parse "{"some very large json request body here"}/oms/customer/v3/users/2133478": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon, Attempt 1  ```  Because of the `WARN RESTY` you can see the warning is logged from the resty code base as this log is hard coded there.  Here is my example gist where i could not recreate the problem and my time budget was done: <https://gist.github.com/niksteff/2fd29672a24372782627d99ba2016031> |

| For everyone that needs a quick fix without downgrading to v2.9.1:  ``` replace github.com/go-resty/resty/v2 => github.com/lattwood/resty/v2 v2.0.0-20231102200459-74e9e135ae0c ```  Put the above line into your `go.mod` file to override the resty code with this PR. |

| In v2.10.0, I've observed an issue where the request body passed to `.SetBody(...)` is intermittently written multiple times under certain conditions.  From what I gather, it is somehow related to the retry mechanism, or at the very least I was only able to reproduce by triggering that.  [In the repro here](https://github.com/patrikeh/resty-request-body-issue), I ping an httptest mock endpoint triggering the retry mechanism, and observe the JSON request body being written multiple consecutive times e.g.  ``` { <some-json> }{ <some-json> }  ```  This issue does not occur in v2.9.1. |

| [@1713266](https://github.com/1713266) I think, possibly, the data race is caused by the release buffer method; it has been fixed in [#745](https://github.com/go-resty/resty/pull/745); could you please check and let me know the outcome? |
