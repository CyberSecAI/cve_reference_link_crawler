Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-7062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in the Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin. This allows an attacker to navigate to files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, leading to the possibility of accessing files outside of the intended directory. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** This can expose sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.
- **Full compromise:** Depending on the information exposed, a complete compromise could result, although this is not explicitly mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker must have a WordPress account with "Contributor" access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with at least Contributor level privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious file path information into the vulnerable plugin through the shortcode functionality.
