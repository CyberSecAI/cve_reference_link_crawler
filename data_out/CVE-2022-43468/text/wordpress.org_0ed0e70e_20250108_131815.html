## Description

WordPress Popular Posts is a highly customizable plugin that displays your most popular posts.

#### Main Features

* **Multiple Popular Posts Lists** – You can have several Popular Posts lists on your blog, each with its own settings!
* **Time Range** – List those posts of your blog that have been the most popular ones within a specific time range (eg. last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc)!
* **Custom Post-type support** – Want to show other stuff than just posts and pages, eg. Popular *Products*? [You can](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-have-a-popular-list-of-my-custom-post-type-how-can-i-do-that)!
* **Thumbnails!** – Display a thumbnail of your posts! (*see the [FAQ section](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-does-wordpress-popular-posts-pick-my-posts-thumbnails) for more details*.)
* **Statistics dashboard** – See how your popular posts are doing directly from your admin area.
* **Sorting options** – Order your popular list by comments, views (default) or average views per day!
* **Custom themes** – Out of the box, WordPress Popular Posts includes some themes so you can style your popular posts list (see [Widget Themes](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list#themes) for more details).
* **Use your own layout!** – WPP is flexible enough to let you customize the look and feel of your popular posts! (see [customizing WPP’s HTML markup](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-can-i-use-my-own-html-markup-with-your-plugin) and [How to style WordPress Popular Posts](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list) for more.)
* **Advanced caching features!** – WordPress Popular Posts includes a few options to make sure your site’s performance stays as good as ever! (see [Performance](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) for more details.)
* **REST API Support** – Embed your popular posts in your (web) app! (see [REST API Endpoints](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/8.-REST-API-Endpoints) for more.)
* **Disqus support** – Sort your popular posts by Disqus comments count!
* **Polylang & WPML 3.2+ support** – Show the translated version of your popular posts!
* **WordPress Multisite support** – Each site on the network can have its own popular posts list!

#### Other Features

* **Shortcode support** – Use the [wpp] shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! For usage and instructions, please refer to the [Installation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/#installation).
* **Template tags** – Don’t feel like using blocks? No problem! You can still embed your most popular entries on your theme using the `wpp_get_mostpopular()` template tag. Additionally, the `wpp_get_views()` template tag allows you to retrieve the views count for a particular post. For usage and instructions, please refer to the [Installation section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/#installation).
* **Localization** – [Translate WPP into your own language](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-translate-your-plugin-into-my-language--help-you-update-a-translation-what-do-i-need-to-do).
* **[WP-PostRatings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-postratings/) support** – Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!

#### PSA: The classic WordPress Popular Posts widget has reached End-of-Life

The classic WordPress Popular Posts widget doesn’t work very well / at all with the new Widgets screen introduced with WordPress 5.8.

This new Widgets screen expects WordPress blocks instead of regular WordPress widgets. If you’re using the classic WordPress Popular Posts widget please replace it with the [WordPress Popular Posts block](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/wordpress-popular-posts-5-3-improved-php-8-support-retina-display-support-and-more/#block-editor-support) instead – it has the same features and functionality as the “classic” widget so you won’t be missing anything at all. See the [Migration Guide](https://cabrerahector.com/wordpress/migrating-from-the-classic-popular-posts-widget/) for more details.

Bjorn from wplearninglab.com was kind enough to create a video explaining how to use the new block for all of you visual learners:

If you cannot (or do not want to) use WordPress blocks on your website then please replace your classic widget with the [[wpp] shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages#the-wpp-shortcode).

## Blocks

This plugin provides 1 block.

* WordPress Popular Posts

## Installation

Please make sure your site meets the [minimum requirements](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts#requirements) before proceeding.

#### Automatic installation

1. Log in into your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New.
3. In the “Search Plugins” field, type in **WordPress Popular Posts** and hit Enter.
4. Find the plugin in the search results list and click on the “Install Now” button.

#### Manual installation

1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress.

#### Done! What’s next?

1. Please see the Usage section below to learn how to add a popular post list to your site. Once you’re done, keep reading.
2. If you have a caching plugin installed on your site, flush its cache now so WPP can start tracking your site.
3. If you have a plugin that minifies JavaScript (JS) installed on your site please read this FAQ: [Is WordPress Popular Posts compatible with plugins that minify/bundle JavaScript code?](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#is-wordpress-popular-posts-compatible-with-plugins-that-minifybundle-javascript-code)
4. If you have a security / firewall plugin installed on your site, make sure you [allow WPP access to the REST API](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wpp-does-not-count-properly/#post-10411163) so it can start tracking your site.
5. Go to Appearance > Editor > Theme File Editor. Under “Theme Files”, click on “Theme Header” (`header.php`) and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (it should be somewhere before the closing `</head>` tag).
6. (Optional but highly recommended) Are you running a medium/high traffic site? If so, it might be a good idea to check [these suggestions](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) to make sure your site’s performance stays up to par.

That’s it!

#### USAGE

WordPress Popular Posts can be used in three different ways:

1. If you’re using the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) you can insert a WordPress Popular Posts block on your sidebar and even anywhere within your posts and pages.
2. As a template tag: you can place it anywhere on your theme with [`wpp_get_mostpopular()`](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular).
3. Via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages), so you can embed it inside a post or a page.

Make sure to stop by the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)** as well, you’ll find even more info there!

That’s it! It stopped working. They themselves decided to abandon it for some reason. Now it doesn’t work on regular sites. Don’t even waste your time.===Всё! Перестал работать. Они сами зачем-то решили от него отказаться. Теперь на обычных сайтах не работает. Даже время не теряйте.

At first I though this was not that good but then with the widget settings amazing! But unfortunately the best bit of the plugin has been removed.
“This widget has been deprecated and will be removed in WordPress Popular Posts 7.0. Please use either the WordPress Popular Posts block or the wpp shortcode instead.” The short code doesn’t allow custom HTML and CSS like the widget, does it? Unless there is a way to add custom HTML to the shortcode I’m just keeping the old version for now. If I update this plugin I’ll lose the custom HTML that looks great and it was the reason I used this plugin. It’s disappointing the widget settings were just removed as it was nice having all the settings in one are. Now we just have to keep checking everything to add shortcode from your site which we shouldn’t have to do.Long ago to speed up the plugin on my site. I set the Ajaxify widget to Disabled and Data Caching to Never Cache. Then turned on the HTML option, hidden in the actual widget area so I could customize stuff. Hummingbird Optimizer was also turned off so I could see the updates properly.
