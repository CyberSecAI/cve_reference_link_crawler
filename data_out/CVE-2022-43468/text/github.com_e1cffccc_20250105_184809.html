## Description

WordPress Popular Posts (from now on, just *WPP*) is a highly customizable [plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/) to showcase the most commented / viewed entries on your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) powered site.

## Features

* **Multiple Popular Posts Lists** - You can have several Popular Posts lists on your blog, each with its own settings!
* **Time Range** - List those posts of your blog that have been the most popular ones within a specific time range (eg. last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc)!
* **Custom Post-type support** - Want to show other stuff than just posts and pages, eg. Popular *Products*? [You can](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-have-a-popular-list-of-my-custom-post-type-how-can-i-do-that)!
* **Thumbnails!** - Display a thumbnail of your posts! (*see the [FAQ section](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-does-wordpress-popular-posts-pick-my-posts-thumbnails) for more details*.)
* **Statistics dashboard** - See how your popular posts are doing directly from your admin area.
* **Sorting options** - Order your popular list by comments, views (default) or average views per day!
* **Custom themes** - Out of the box, WordPress Popular Posts includes some themes so you can style your popular posts list (see [Widget Themes](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list#themes) for more details).
* **Use your own layout!** - WPP is flexible enough to let you customize the look and feel of your popular posts! (see [customizing WPP's HTML markup](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-can-i-use-my-own-html-markup-with-your-plugin) and [How to style WordPress Popular Posts](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list) for more.)
* **Advanced caching features!** - WordPress Popular Posts includes a few options to make sure your site's performance stays as good as ever! (see [Performance](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) for more details.)
* **REST API Support** - Embed your popular posts in your (web) app! (see [REST API Endpoints](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/8.-REST-API-Endpoints) for more.)
* **Disqus support** - Sort your popular posts by Disqus comments count!
* **Polylang & WPML 3.2+ support** - Show the translated version of your popular posts!
* **WordPress Multisite support** - Each site on the network can have its own popular posts list!
* **Shortcode support** - Use the [wpp] shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! For usage and instructions, please refer to the [Usage section](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/#usage).
* **Template tags** - Don't feel like using blocks? No problem! You can still embed your most popular entries on your theme using the `wpp_get_mostpopular()` template tag. Additionally, the `wpp_get_views()` template tag allows you to retrieve the views count for a particular post. For usage and instructions, please refer to the [Usage section](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/#usage).
* **Localization** - [Translate WPP into your own language](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#i-want-to-translate-your-plugin-into-my-language--help-you-update-a-translation-what-do-i-need-to-do).
* **[WP-PostRatings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-postratings/) support** - Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!

Looking for a **Recent Posts** widget just as featured-packed as WordPress Popular Posts? **Try [Recently](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recently/)**!

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.7 or newer.
* PHP 7.2 or newer.
* Mbstring PHP Extension.
* Since WordPress Popular Posts writes constantly to the database to keep track of page views, [InnoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoDB) support is required.

## Installation

### Automatic installation

1. Log in into your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New.
3. In the "Search Plugins" field, type in **WordPress Popular Posts** and hit Enter.
4. Find the plugin in the search results list and click on the "Install Now" button.

### Manual installation

1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

### Done! What's next?

1. Please see the Usage section below to learn how to add a popular post list to your site. Once you're done, keep reading.
2. If you have a caching plugin installed on your site, flush its cache now so WPP can start tracking your site.
3. If you have a plugin that minifies JavaScript (JS) installed on your site please read this FAQ: [Is WordPress Popular Posts compatible with plugins that minify/bundle JavaScript code?](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#is-wordpress-popular-posts-compatible-with-plugins-that-minifybundle-javascript-code)
4. If you have a security / firewall plugin installed on your site, make sure you [allow WPP access to the REST API](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wpp-does-not-count-properly/#post-10411163) so it can start tracking your site.
5. Go to Appearance > Editor > Theme File Editor. Under "Theme Files", click on "Theme Header" (`header.php`) and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (it should be somewhere before the closing `</head>` tag).
6. (Optional but highly recommended) Are you running a medium/high traffic site? If so, it might be a good idea to check [these suggestions](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) to make sure your site's performance stays up to par.

That's it!

## Usage

WordPress Popular Posts can be used in three different ways:

1. If you're using the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) you can insert a WordPress Popular Posts block on your sidebar (eg. via Appearance > Widgets) and even anywhere within your posts and pages.
2. As a template tag: you can place it anywhere on your theme with [`wpp_get_mostpopular()`](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular).
3. Via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-%26-pages), so you can embed it inside a post or a page.

... and there's even more on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)** section, so make sure to stop by!
