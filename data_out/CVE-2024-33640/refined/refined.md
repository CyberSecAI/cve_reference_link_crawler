- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pretty Google Calendar plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.7.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will then be executed when visitors access the site, potentially leading to various malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor injects scripts, likely through plugin functionality that doesn't properly sanitize user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's input. The content states that the vulnerability requires Contributor privileges, meaning an attacker would require a user account with at least this level of permissions.
