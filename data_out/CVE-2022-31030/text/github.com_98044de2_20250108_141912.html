# containerd CRI plugin: Host memory exhaustion through ExecSync

Moderate

[dmcgowan](/dmcgowan)
published
GHSA-5ffw-gxpp-mxpf
Jun 6, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 1.5.12, 1.6.0, 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, 1.6.4, 1.6.5

## Patched versions

1.5.13, 1.6.6

## Description

### Impact

A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when executing processes via an "exec" facility.

### Patches

This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

Ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.
