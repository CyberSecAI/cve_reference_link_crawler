Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-41723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control, specifically allowing a user with the "Veeam ONE Read-Only User" role to view the "Dashboard Schedule," a function they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to restrict access to the "Dashboard Schedule" based on user roles. Read-Only users should not be able to view this information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability enables unauthorized viewing of configuration data (Dashboard Schedule).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with the "Veeam ONE Read-Only User" role can view the dashboard schedule.
*   **Limited Impact:** The document explicitly states that the impact is reduced as the Read-Only user can only view the schedule and not modify it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Veeam ONE Web Client.
*   **User Role:** The attacker must have a "Veeam ONE Read-Only User" role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account with the "Veeam ONE Read-Only User" role within the Veeam ONE system.
*   The attacker must be able to access the Veeam ONE Web Client through the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document states that the criticality of this vulnerability is reduced due to the limited impact -  read-only users can only view, and not modify the schedule.
*   The document provides details about affected versions (Veeam ONE 11, 11a, 12) and the hotfixes available to remediate the vulnerability.
*   The document also provides SHA1 hashes to validate the hotfix deployment
