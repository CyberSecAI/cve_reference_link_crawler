- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Windows Update Assistant, specifically in how it handles directory junctions during a version update.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of directory junctions allowing attackers to manipulate file access control lists (DACLs). This improper handling enables arbitrary file modification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate privileges and execute code in the context of SYSTEM, leading to a complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker creates a directory junction. Then the attacker must wait for an administrator to start a Windows version update. The Windows Update Assistant will then write to an attacker controlled location using the directory junction, which leads to an attacker gaining control of an arbitrary file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
    - Needs an administrator to initiate a Windows version update.
