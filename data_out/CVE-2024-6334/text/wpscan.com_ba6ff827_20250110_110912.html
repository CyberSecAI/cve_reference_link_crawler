## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Easy Table of Contents < 2.0.67 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

You should create new post with two more heading. Go to the settings of the plugin and change "ez-toc-settings[heading\_text\_tag]" field to "Malicious JS code".
