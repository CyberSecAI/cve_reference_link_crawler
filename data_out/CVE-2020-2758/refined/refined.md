Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2758:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability exists in the VBoxVGA graphics controller component of Oracle VirtualBox.
- The process handling the `VBoxVHWASurfaceBase` object does not properly validate the existence of the object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Use-after-free vulnerability: The code attempts to use an object that has already been freed or is no longer valid.
- Lack of proper object existence validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Privilege escalation: An attacker can escalate privileges from a high-privileged guest user to the hypervisor level.
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.
- Potential for complete control of the host system (hypervisor) depending on the attacker's actions

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local attack: The attacker needs to be present on the guest system, or at least have high-privileged code execution rights on it.
- Exploitation of the VBoxVGA graphics controller via the VBoxVHWASurfaceBase object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable VBoxVGA graphics controller component.
