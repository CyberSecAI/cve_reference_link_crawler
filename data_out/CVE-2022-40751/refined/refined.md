- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently protected LDAP search credentials. An Administrator user could gain access to previously configured LDAP search credentials used during authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (LDAP credentials).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An administrator user could gain access to LDAP search credentials. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the LDAP server and the information stored within it.
- **Attack vectors:** An administrator user, already with some level of access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An administrator-level account is required to exploit this vulnerability.
