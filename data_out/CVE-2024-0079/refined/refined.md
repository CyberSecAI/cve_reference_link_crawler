- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the kernel mode layer of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver, where a user within a guest virtual machine (VM) can trigger a NULL-pointer dereference in the host system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** NULL-pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service on the host system.
- **Attack vectors:** A user within a guest VM can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a guest VM, indicating they require a low level of privilege on the guest machine.
