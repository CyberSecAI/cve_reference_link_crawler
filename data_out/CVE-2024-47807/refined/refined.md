Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-47807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin does not validate the `iss` (Issuer) claim of an ID Token during the authentication flow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Lack of proper validation of the `iss` claim in the ID Token. This allows the plugin to accept tokens from untrusted Identity Providers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially subvert the authentication flow and gain unauthorized access to Jenkins, potentially including administrator access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed remotely via network by manipulating the ID token presented during authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ID token to the Jenkins server. This can be achieved with no prior access.

**Affected Plugin:**
OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin

**Affected versions:**
Up to and including 4.354.v321ce67a_1de8

**Fixed versions:**
4.355.v3a_fb_fca_b_96d4

**Additional Note:** When using the "Manual entry" configuration mode, the new "Issuer" field must be populated after updating to protect from this issue. When using "Discovery via well-known endpoint", the Issuer will be set automatically.
