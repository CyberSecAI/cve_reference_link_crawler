### @11k **[11k](/11k)** commented [Jul 14, 2020](#issue-656860316)

For WebSocket upgrade requests, `gorilla/websocket` calls `CheckOrigin` to determine if the upgrade should be performed. The function should "carefully validate the request origin to prevent cross-site request forgery".

The current implementation immediately returns `true`, essentially performing no check. If undefined, a ["safe default"](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/blob/b65e62901fc1c0d968042419e74789f6af455eb9/server.go#L86-L97) is used, which only upgrades the request if the host component of the `Origin` header matches the `Host` header.

This PR removes the current implementation so the default is used.

Sorry, something went wrong.
