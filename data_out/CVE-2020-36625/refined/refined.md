The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient origin check in the WebSocket upgrade process. The `CheckOrigin` function in the `gorilla/websocket` library was overridden to always return `true`, effectively disabling any origin validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** By bypassing origin validation, an attacker could potentially initiate a WebSocket connection from a different origin than the server expects, leading to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially perform actions on behalf of a victim user without the victim's knowledge or consent. This could include sending malicious messages, performing unauthorized operations, or gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious webpage hosted on a different origin can initiate a WebSocket upgrade request to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or control a resource that can initiate WebSocket connections to the vulnerable server.
