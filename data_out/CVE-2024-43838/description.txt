In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix overflow check in adjust_jmp_off()

adjust_jmp_off() incorrectly used the insn->imm field for all overflow check,
which is incorrect as that should only be done or the BPF_JMP32 | BPF_JA case,
not the general jump instruction case. Fix it by using insn->off for overflow
check in the general case.
