Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 115.2

#### [#CVE-2023-4573: Memory corruption in IPC CanvasTranslator](#CVE-2023-4573)

Reporter
sonakkbi
Impact
high
##### Description

When receiving rendering data over IPC `mStream` could have been destroyed when initialized, which could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1846687](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1846687)

#### [#CVE-2023-4574: Memory corruption in IPC ColorPickerShownCallback](#CVE-2023-4574)

Reporter
sonakkbi
Impact
high
##### Description

When creating a callback over IPC for showing the Color Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2023-4575: Memory corruption in IPC FilePickerShownCallback](#CVE-2023-4575)

Reporter
sonakkbi
Impact
high
##### Description

When creating a callback over IPC for showing the File Picker window, multiple of the same callbacks could have been created at a time and eventually all simultaneously destroyed as soon as one of the callbacks finished. This could have led to a use-after-free causing a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2023-4576: Integer Overflow in RecordedSourceSurfaceCreation](#CVE-2023-4576)

Reporter
fffvr
Impact
high
##### Description

On Windows, an integer overflow could occur in `RecordedSourceSurfaceCreation` which resulted in a heap buffer overflow potentially leaking sensitive data that could have led to a sandbox escape.
*This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1846694](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1846694)

#### [#CVE-2023-4577: Memory corruption in JIT UpdateRegExpStatics](#CVE-2023-4577)

Reporter
Lukas Bernhard
Impact
high
##### Description

When `UpdateRegExpStatics` attempted to access `initialStringHeap` it could already have been garbage collected prior to entering the function, which could potentially have led to an exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1847397](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1847397)

#### [#CVE-2023-4051: Full screen notification obscured by file open dialog](#CVE-2023-4051)

Reporter
Hafiizh
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A website could have obscured the full screen notification by using the file open dialog. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1821884](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1821884)

#### [#CVE-2023-4578: Error reporting methods in SpiderMonkey could have triggered an Out of Memory Exception](#CVE-2023-4578)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When calling `JS::CheckRegExpSyntax` a Syntax Error could have been set which would end in calling `convertToRuntimeErrorAndClear`. A path in the function could attempt to allocate memory when none is available which would have caused a newly created Out of Memory exception to be mishandled as a Syntax Error.

* [Bug 1839007](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1839007)

#### [#CVE-2023-4053: Full screen notification obscured by external program](#CVE-2023-4053)

Reporter
Umar Farooq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A website could have obscured the full screen notification by using a URL with a scheme handled by an external program, such as a mailto URL. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1839079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1839079)

#### [#CVE-2023-4580: Push notifications saved to disk unencrypted](#CVE-2023-4580)

Reporter
Harveer Singh
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Push notifications stored on disk in private browsing mode were not being encrypted potentially allowing the leak of sensitive information.

##### References

* [Bug 1843046](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1843046)

#### [#CVE-2023-4581: XLL file extensions were downloadable without warnings](#CVE-2023-4581)

Reporter
Umar Farooq (@Puf)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Excel `.xll` add-in files did not have a blocklist entry in Firefox's executable blocklist which allowed them to be downloaded without any warning of their potential harm.

##### References

* [Bug 1843758](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1843758)

#### [#CVE-2023-4582: Buffer Overflow in WebGL glGetProgramiv](#CVE-2023-4582)

Reporter
Dohyun Lee (@l33d0hyun) of SSD-Disclosure Labs & DNSLab, Korea Univ.
Impact
low
##### Description

Due to large allocation checks in Angle for glsl shaders being too lenient a buffer overflow could have occured when allocating too much private shader memory on mac OS.
*This bug only affects Firefox on macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1773874](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1773874)

#### [#CVE-2023-4583: Browsing Context potentially not cleared when closing Private Window](#CVE-2023-4583)

Reporter
Thejaka Maldeniya
Impact

Reporter
Randell Jesup, Andrew McCreight, the Mozilla Fuzzing Team
Impact
high
##### Description

Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 116, Firefox ESR 102.14, Firefox ESR 115.1, Thunderbird 102.14, and Thunderbird 115.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
