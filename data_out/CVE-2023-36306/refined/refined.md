{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to multiple php files within the application, injecting XSS payloads via URL parameters",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application. It is noted that if installed with a database an attacker will need read only user access. If installed without a database no login is required"
