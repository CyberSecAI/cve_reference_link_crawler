# Trusted by the World's Most Demanding Professionals

Join the ranks of the largest and most competitive legal and professional service firms that don't leave the question of "where did my time go" to memory or chance.

KnowMore by Element55 automatically captures time and delivers the report back to the professional or the assistant in a simple, secure, private report. No Big Brother here.

Whether from desktop, laptop, remote access (yes, Citrix too), mobile, calendar, office phone, dictation - wherever they work, the information is captured for them, cross-referenced. and delivered by email, web, mobile app - or even paper, if that's how they'll read it!

# Zero-Click Access To Your Day

The time capture technology in KnowMore automatically captures time spent in the office, at home, or wherever a professional is working. Information is sent directly and privately to show how they spent their time the day before.

Professionals and assistants can review their time via

1. A daily email report
2. A streamlined web interface for pulling reports and customizing settings
3. Or an assistant can print out reports for their principal

Training is minimal for KnowMore since all you need to do is read the email. That's it!

# Six More Billable Hours Per Month

Professionals who have access to their automatically captured day recover an additional six billable hours per month, according to the seminal study "[Zero Click Time Capture](/resources/marketing-assets/ILTA%20Zero%20Click%20WP.pdf)" published by the International Legal Technology Association.

Of course, some capture more and some less - but consider the math! (Compare it with the pricing below!)

Isn't that worth a free trial?
