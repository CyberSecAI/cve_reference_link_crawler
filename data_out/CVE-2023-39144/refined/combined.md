# CVE-2023-39144

## Background

I discovered this vulnerability in May of 2023. Element55 produces software for law offices to track time. This software pulls information from various locations, such as Exchange, SQL, and Shoretel.

## Timeline

* May 24, 2023 - Reported vulnerability to Element 55
* May 25, 2023 - Element55 confirmed the vulnerability and said they would be fixing as part of version 22. (They were professional and great to work with)
* July 24, 2023 - Confirmed with Element 55 that is had been fixed.

## Vulnerability Description

The Element55 Maketime Appliance stores passwords in cleartext within the application. This can be
seen by navigating to admin pages for Exchange, LDAP, SQL, and Shortel. Passwords that have been
submitted to Maketime within these pages are obfuscated with asterisks. However, when viewing the
HTML source the passwords are visible in plain text. While by itself this doesn't qualify as
critical, it's not unusual for users to make a service account a Domain Administrator, and Exchange
service accounts by themselves are often unnecessarily over-provisioned, meaning that if someone
does gain access to them, they can escalate their privileges within a network. Finally, passwords
that are chosen for web consoles are often weak and guessable, such as admin:admin.

## Location of vulnerable HTML tags

LDAP:

```
<input type=password name="settings[ldap_password]" value="password" size=20>

```

Exchange:

```
<input type=password name="settings[exchange_password]" value="password" size=20>

```

SQL:

```
<input type=password name="settings[ms_password]" value="password" size=20>

```

Shoretel:

```
<input type=password name="settings[password]" value="password" size=20>

```

## Vulnerable Versions

21 and older.

## Fixed Version

22

# Trusted by the World's Most Demanding Professionals

Join the ranks of the largest and most competitive legal and professional service firms that don't leave the question of "where did my time go" to memory or chance.

KnowMore by Element55 automatically captures time and delivers the report back to the professional or the assistant in a simple, secure, private report. No Big Brother here.

Whether from desktop, laptop, remote access (yes, Citrix too), mobile, calendar, office phone, dictation - wherever they work, the information is captured for them, cross-referenced. and delivered by email, web, mobile app - or even paper, if that's how they'll read it!

# Zero-Click Access To Your Day

The time capture technology in KnowMore automatically captures time spent in the office, at home, or wherever a professional is working. Information is sent directly and privately to show how they spent their time the day before.

Professionals and assistants can review their time via

1. A daily email report
2. A streamlined web interface for pulling reports and customizing settings
3. Or an assistant can print out reports for their principal

Training is minimal for KnowMore since all you need to do is read the email. That's it!

# Six More Billable Hours Per Month

Professionals who have access to their automatically captured day recover an additional six billable hours per month, according to the seminal study "[Zero Click Time Capture](/resources/marketing-assets/ILTA%20Zero%20Click%20WP.pdf)" published by the International Legal Technology Association.

Of course, some capture more and some less - but consider the math! (Compare it with the pricing below!)

Isn't that worth a free trial?

[Read the White Paper](resources/marketing-assets/ILTA%20Zero%20Click%20WP.pdf)

6 billable hours / month

x $250 / hour

x 50 professionals

---

$75,000 per month recovered revenue.
