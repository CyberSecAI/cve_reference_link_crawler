# Remotely exploitable DoS in Tonic `v0.12.0<=v0.12.2`

Low

[LucioFranco](/LucioFranco)
published
GHSA-4jwc-w2hc-78qv
Oct 1, 2024

## Package

cargo

tonic
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

0.12.2

## Patched versions

0.12.3

## Description

### Impact

**note:** this only affects v0.12.0 - v0.12.2

When using `tonic::transport::Server` there is a remote DoS attack that can cause the server to exit cleanly on accepting a tcp/tls stream. This can be triggered via causing the accept call to error out with errors there were not covered correctly causing the accept loop to exit.

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/issues/1897)

### Patches

Upgrading to tonic `0.12.3` and above contains the fix.

### Workarounds

A custom accept loop is a possible workaround.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47609

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

| Bug ReportVersion v0.12.2 and master branch Platform Darwin XXX 23.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Mon Jul 29 21:14:30 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE\_ARM64\_T6000 arm64 Description First, let's try to run the `server.rs` and `client.rs` in [examples/src/tls](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/tree/master/examples/src/tls). The server says:  ``` Got a request from Some([::1]:59511) with info TlsConnectInfo { inner: TcpConnectInfo { local_addr: Some([::1]:50051), remote_addr: Some([::1]:59511) }, certs: None }  ```  And the client says:  ``` RESPONSE=Response { metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {"content-type": "application/grpc", "date": "Wed, 28 Aug 2024 09:15:40 GMT", "grpc-status": "0"} }, message: EchoResponse { message: "hello" }, extensions: Extensions }  ```  Everything is OK for now.  Then, let's change one line in `client.rs`:     [tonic/examples/src/tls/client.rs](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/blob/82a856fea851cc20641572d61d51408ab37693b6/examples/src/tls/client.rs#L14-L17)  Lines 14 to 17 in [82a856f](/hyperium/tonic/commit/82a856fea851cc20641572d61d51408ab37693b6)   |  | let tls = ClientTlsConfig::new() | | --- | --- | |  | .ca\_certificate(ca) | |  | .domain\_name("example.com"); | |  |  |      modify `.domain_name("example.com");`  to `.domain_name("wrong.com");`  in L16  And then, run the `server.rs` and `client.rs` again.  We can see the client says:  ``` Error: tonic::transport::Error(Transport, ConnectError(Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: InvalidCertificate(NotValidForName) }))  ```  It's OK, but the server process EXIT WITH NO ERROR. It confuses me. |
