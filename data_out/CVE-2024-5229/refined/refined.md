Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Primary Addon for Elementor" plugin's Pricing Table widget. Specifically, user-supplied attributes were not properly handled when rendering the pricing table on the frontend. This lack of sanitization and escaping allowed for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through the vulnerable input fields are saved in the database and executed whenever a user accesses a page containing the affected pricing table widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users visiting the compromised page.
*   **Website Manipulation:** The attacker could also manipulate the content of the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions that undermine the site's integrity and user trust.
*   **Phishing:** The injected scripts can be used for phishing attacks, tricking users to enter their credentials or sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Pricing Table widget of the "Primary Addon for Elementor" plugin.
*   Specifically, it exploits a lack of sanitization in the fields within this widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site to be able to use the affected widgets and inject scripts through the Elementor editor.
*   **Elementor Plugin:** The Elementor plugin and the vulnerable Primary Addon for Elementor plugin must both be installed and active.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Widget:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable Pricing Table widget within the Primary Addon for Elementor and how to add it to a page.
