Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `um_loggedin` shortcode of the Ultimate Member plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes within the shortcode are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website database that will be executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Account Hijacking:** The injected scripts can be used to steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could potentially redirect users to malicious websites or initiate downloads of malware.
*   **Website Defacement:** Injected scripts could alter the appearance or functionality of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by inserting a malicious `um_loggedin` shortcode with crafted attributes into a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress website.
*   **Content Creation Permissions:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts or pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within the `class-shortcodes.php` file of the plugin, specifically the `um_loggedin` function.
*   The fix involves using `wp_kses` to sanitize the output of the shortcode, and adding a filter `um_loggedin_inner_content` to allow developers to modify inner content of the shortcode.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.7 of the Ultimate Member plugin.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the Ultimate Member plugin allows authenticated users with contributor access or higher to inject malicious scripts via the `um_loggedin` shortcode due to the lack of sanitization. This can lead to stored XSS attacks with impacts ranging from data theft to website defacement. The fix involves sanitizing the output of the shortcode using `wp_kses`.
