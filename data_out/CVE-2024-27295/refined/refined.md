- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The password reset mechanism in Directus uses the provided email address from the password reset request to send the reset email, instead of the email stored in the database. This, combined with the default accent-insensitive and case-insensitive comparison settings in MySQL/MariaDB, allows an attacker to request a password reset using an email address that has accented characters, which matches the target user's email in the database.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Improper handling of user-supplied email addresses during password reset.
  - MySQL/MariaDB configured with default accent and case-insensitive comparison settings.
  - Inconsistency in email address usage for verification and notification.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can receive a password reset email for a victim's account by using a similar email address with accented characters. This allows the attacker to take over the victim's account and perform malicious actions.

- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the Directus API.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker must know the target user's email address or a close approximation of it.
  - The attacker needs to register an email domain that contains an accented character variation of the victim's domain.
  - The attacker can then request a password reset using the accented email address via the `/auth/password/request` API endpoint.
