A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows TCP/IP stack due to the processing of a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-2013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-2013).

#### Mitigating Factors for Reference Counter Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2013

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Reference Counter Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2013

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block unused UDP ports at the perimeter firewall**

  Blocking unused (closed) UDP ports at the perimeter firewall helps protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Reference Counter Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2013

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the Windows kernel.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows TCP/IP stack processes a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets, resulting in an integer overflow.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc739443%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is UDP?**

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a TCP/IP standard defined in RFC 768, "User Datagram Protocol (UDP)." UDP is used by some programs instead of TCP for fast, lightweight, unreliable transportation of data between TCP/IP hosts. UDP provides a connectionless datagram service that offers best-effort delivery, which means that UDP does not guarantee delivery or verify sequencing for any datagrams. A source host that needs reliable communication must use either TCP or a program that provides its own sequencing and acknowledgment services. For more information, see the TechNet article, [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc785220%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets to a closed port on a target system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers are primarily at risk of this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows TCP/IP stack keeps track of UDP packets within memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
