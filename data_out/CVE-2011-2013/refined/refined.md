- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when the Windows TCP/IP stack processes a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow in the Windows TCP/IP stack when handling UDP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the affected system. The attacker can then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets to a closed port on a target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the target system. No special access or authentication is required.
