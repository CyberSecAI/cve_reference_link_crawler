- The specific endpoint vulnerable is: `DESKTOP_EDIT_USER_GET_KEYS_FIELDS`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires network access to the Evolution Controller web interface.
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is an unauthenticated access control bypass.

**Additional Information:**

- Affected versions: Evolution Controller versions 2.04.560.31.03.2024 and below are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability allows for sensitive information disclosure, specifically user key values.
- The CVSS score is 7.5 with the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N indicating high confidentiality impact but no impact on integrity or availability.
