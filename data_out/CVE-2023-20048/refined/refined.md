- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient authorization of configuration commands sent through the FMC web service interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection due to insufficient authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized configuration commands on a Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) device managed by the vulnerable FMC software. This could lead to unauthorized changes to the FTD device's configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via crafted HTTP requests to the FMC web services interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs valid credentials on the FMC Software to authenticate to the web services interface.
