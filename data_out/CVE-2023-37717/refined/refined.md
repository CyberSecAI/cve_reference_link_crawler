- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `page` function of the `/goform/fromDhcpListClient` page in Tenda routers. The function reads user-provided input for the `page` parameter and uses it in an `sprintf` call without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing length check in `sprintf`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE) could be achieved by a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a specially crafted GET request to `/goform/fromDhcpListClient` with a large value for the `page` parameter, the attacker can overflow the stack buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected router. No authentication is mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

This content provides more detailed information than a typical CVE description. It identifies the specific vulnerable function (`page` in `/goform/fromDhcpListClient`), the cause of the overflow (missing length check in `sprintf`), and provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.
