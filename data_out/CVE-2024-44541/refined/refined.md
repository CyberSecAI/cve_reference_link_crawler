The content is related to CVE-2024-44541.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `/action=processlogin` endpoint of Inventio Lite v4. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `username` parameter of the login process.
- Lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and personal information.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain administrative access, potentially leading to data modification or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/action=processlogin` endpoint.
- Maliciously crafted SQL payload injected via the `username` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the application server.
- No prior authentication is required, allowing unauthenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
