Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-43494:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Jenkins, when filtering builds in the build history widget, does not exclude sensitive build variables (like password parameter values) from the search.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive build variables are not excluded from the search functionality, making them potentially accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Item/Read permission can obtain values of sensitive variables used in builds. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems or resources protected by those credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the build history widget, by crafting a search expression that targets specific sensitive variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Item/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft search expressions to iterate and discover the values of the sensitive variables.
