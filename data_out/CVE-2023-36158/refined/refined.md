Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-36158

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields of the "My Account" section within the Toll Tax Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields, which will then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed in the application.
    - **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
- **Account Takeover:** If an administrator account is compromised, the attacker could gain full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the Toll Tax Management System.
- **User Input Fields:** The specific vulnerable fields are "First Name" and "Last Name" located within the "My Account" section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the Toll Tax Management System (e.g., a default user) to log in and access the "My Account" section.

**Technical Details & POC (from the provided GitHub content):**

**XSS 1:**
1.  Log in to the admin dashboard
2.  Navigate to "My Account"
3.  Insert payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` in the "First Name" field.
4.  Update the changes.

**XSS 2:**
1.  Log in to the admin dashboard
2.  Navigate to "My Account"
3.  Insert payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` in the "Last Name" field.
4. Update the changes.

This demonstrates how to trigger the stored XSS vulnerability by injecting a simple JavaScript alert.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the Toll Tax Management System, as reported in the provided content.
- The system is built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, Bootstrap and AdminLTE.
- Default admin credentials are 'admin'/'admin123'.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk to the system and its users due to the potential for malicious JavaScript execution.
