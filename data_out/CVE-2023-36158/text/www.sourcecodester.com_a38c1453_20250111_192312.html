## **Introduction**

This project is a **Toll-Tax Management System in PHP**. This is a web-based application project developed in **PHP** and **MySQL Database**. This project manages the toll tax transaction of an expressway or private highways. The application stores the records of the vehicle and the owner with the data about the vehicle passes on the specific toll gate effectively and efficiently. The management can also easily retrieve the records in this system. This project was developed with **Bootstrap** and **AdminLTE Template** for the user interface. It also consists of user-friendly features and functionalities.

## **About the Toll Tax Management System in PHP**

I developed this project using the following:

* **[XAMPP v3.3.0](https://apachefriends.org)**
* **PHP**
* **MySQL Database**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **Ajax**
* **jQuery**
* **Bootstrap**
* **Font Awesome**
* **AdminLTE**

This **Toll-Tax Management System in PHP** can be only accessed by the **Management** and the **Toll Collectors**. The management site consists of all the features and functionalities that this project has. It requires an **Administrator User** login credentials to gain access to this site. The admin users are in charge of managing the list of vehicle categories, toll gates, users, and system information. Admin users have the privilege of managing and accessing the recipient, passes, and pass history list. The Toll Collector users have only limited permissions on the system. In this system, management can store the toll information that uses cash which can be managed on the recipient page. For cashless transactions, the management can create passes for the vehicle owner which have a balanced amount and will be deducted every time vehicle passes a toll gate. The application also generates printable reports for the passes created, recipients, and pass history.
