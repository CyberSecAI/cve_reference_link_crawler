This bug in dwarf\_get\_xu\_section\_offset() has been present since the code was created in 2021. The original ossfuzz id for this was 71412. There was no proper check for a usable dw\_column\_index as well as other fields from the .debug\_tu\_index and .debug\_cu\_index sections. Could result in a crash (segv) or possibly just invalid data being returned, depending on the contents and layout of memory.

So the factored value when multiplied by the factor could overflow. In some of the cases the factored value is signed, some it is unsigned. This sanity checking of factored frame offset values never existed before in the library.datefixed: 2023-06-08references: regressiontests/ossfuzz59517/fuzz\_set\_frame\_all-5741671019839488gitfixid: f664f93d456284130afbd3c2e35b39e5f2740366tarrelease: libdwarf-0.8.0.tar.xzendrec: DW202306-001
