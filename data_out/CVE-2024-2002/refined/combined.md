| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2267700#c0)  ybuenos    2024-03-04 14:37:30 UTC  ``` In a multiply-corrupted DWARF object libdwarf may try to dealloc(free) an allocation twice. Results are unpredictable and various. This has been a possibility since we added code to prevent leaks when generating 'unattached' Dwarf_Error records (where there is no Dwarf_Debug available at the point of error). The problem was introduced in libdwarf-0.1.0 in 2021.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2267700#c1)  ybuenos    2024-03-04 14:38:40 UTC  ``` Flaw ID on github repo: DW202402-002   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2267700#c2)  ybuenos    2024-03-04 16:23:51 UTC  ``` Created libdwarf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2267720](show_bug.cgi?id=2267720 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-2002 libdwarf: crashes randomly on fuzzed object [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

There was no proper check for a usable dw\_column\_index as well as other fields from the .debug\_tu\_index and .debug\_cu\_index sections.
