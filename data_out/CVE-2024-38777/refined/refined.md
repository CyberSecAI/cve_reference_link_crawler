- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could lead to an unprivileged user performing actions they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact varies on the function being exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by any user with 'subscriber' level privileges by exploiting a function with insufficient access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least 'subscriber' privileges.
