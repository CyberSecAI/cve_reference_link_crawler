- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in its bulk actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF checks, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can induce a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary menus via a CSRF attack.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a logged-in admin into visiting a malicious page (e.g., containing a crafted form), an attacker can trigger the deletion of menus without the admin's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page while they are authenticated.
