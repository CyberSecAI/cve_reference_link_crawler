- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A server-generated error message containing sensitive information vulnerability [CWE-550] in FortiOS and FortiProxy web proxy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Web proxy error pages disclose sensitive information, specifically the client username and IP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious webserver can retrieve a web proxy's client username and IP.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious web server leverages same-origin HTTP requests to trigger proxy-generated HTTP status code pages, which include sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious webserver that can be accessed through the vulnerable FortiOS/FortiProxy instance. The user must also interact with this malicious server.
