- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FortiWLC system had two hardcoded accounts used by Meru Access Points to report core dumps. These accounts had read/write privileges over the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded credentials, excessive privileges granted to these accounts, and persistence of these accounts through firmware upgrades in older versions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute unauthorized code or commands on the system, gaining significant control over the affected devices and network.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation; if an attacker gained access to the network, they could leverage these accounts to compromise the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need network access and knowledge of these hardcoded credentials or the ability to somehow leverage them from the Meru Access Points.
