Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The TOTOLINK A950RG router firmware version V4.1.2cu.5204_B20210112 contains a hardcoded password for the root user. This password is located in `/etc/shadow.sample`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded password: The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hardcoded password in the firmware.
- Predictable password: The password "cs2012" is easily discovered once the `/etc/shadow.sample` file is decrypted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full system access: An attacker who discovers this hardcoded password can gain root access to the router, allowing for complete control over the device.
- Potential for malicious actions: With root access, the attacker can reconfigure the router, intercept traffic, install malware, or use the router as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**
- Firmware analysis: The attacker needs to obtain and analyze the router's firmware to extract the `/etc/shadow.sample` file and the hardcoded password.
- Network access: Once they have the password, they can attempt to log in through SSH, or any other remote management interface exposed by the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to obtain firmware: The attacker needs to acquire the vulnerable firmware file from the vendor or other sources.
- Technical skills: The attacker must possess the skills to decrypt, analyze the firmware and locate the hardcoded password.
- Network access: Attacker needs to be able to connect to the router via LAN or WAN once the root password is discovered.
