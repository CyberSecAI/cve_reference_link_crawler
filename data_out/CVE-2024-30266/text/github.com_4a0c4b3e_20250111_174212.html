`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type](/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/734aa7b7530d7104ccddd36301057dcd150d8511 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes #8281")`

| Thanks for the report! Do you perhaps have more detail on how this was discovered? For example is this a reduced module? Or perhaps a fuzz-generated test case?  Also as per [our documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security-what-is-considered-a-security-vulnerability.html) this is a security issue so we'll be issuing a CVE and a 19.0.1 release for this. If you discover more issues like this we'd be grateful if you'd [contact us privately](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/SECURITY.md) so we can coordinate this, thanks! |

externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
"expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

| We are in progress of implementing a wasm fuzzer based on [SpecTec](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec/tree/main/spectec). Currently, it generates short wasm programs by a simple syntax-driven approach. We performed differential testing with the latest wasmtime and previous versions, and luckily found the bug. We reduced the buggy program manually as the generated program was simple. |

| Nice! If y'all need any help with fuzzing or such we're happy to talk as well. And thank you for fuzzing, we very much appreciate it! |
