This commit is an attempt to make the mistake fixed in [#8016](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8016) harder to happen again. This removes the `set_raw` helper entirely from tables and instead forces all callers to view the table as either a table of funcrefs or a table of externefs. By forcing that choice outwards instead of handling it inwards it enables dealing with a typed table in more contexts which should help naturally do the right thing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Relative to [#8016](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8016) this was the other issue I found, this forgot to check whether the table was an externref table or funcref table and triggered a panic by assuming a global was a funcref.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type](/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/734aa7b7530d7104ccddd36301057dcd150d8511 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes #8281")`

"functions" encoding as opposed to the "expressions" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
"expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (](/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/24f7f40f5ec5f96722e97abe4090195a0afa59d2 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (#8283) (#8284)

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.
