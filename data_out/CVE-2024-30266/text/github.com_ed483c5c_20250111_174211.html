Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type ([#8283](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283))

```
This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in [#8018](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018) where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
"functions" encoding as opposed to the "expressions" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
"expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes [#8281](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281)
