# Panic when using a dropped extenref-typed element segment

Low

[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)
published
GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5
Apr 2, 2024

## Package

cargo

wasmtime
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

19.0.0

## Patched versions

19.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The 19.0.0 release of Wasmtime contains a regression introduced during its development which can lead to a guest WebAssembly module causing a panic in the host runtime. A valid WebAssembly module, when executed at runtime, may cause this panic. The panic in question is caused when a WebAssembly module issues a `table.*` instruction which uses a dropped element segment with a table that also has an `externref` type. This causes Wasmtime to erroneously use an empty function segment instead of an empty externref segment to perform this operation. This mismatch in types causes a panic in Wasmtime when it's asserted that an externref table is only viewed as externrefs.

This regression was introduced during the development of the 19.0.0 release and only affects the 19.0.0 release. This panic requires the `reference-types` WebAssembly feature to be enabled, and it is enabled by default. Toolchains are not known to generate this pattern by default so it's likely a module would need to be specifically crafted to trigger this panic.

A panic in a host runtime represents a possible denial-of-service in some scenarios. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.

### Patches

Wasmtime 19.0.1 has been released to fix this problem. Users of 19.0.0 should upgrade to 19.0.1. All other versions of Wasmtime are not affected by this issue.

### Workarounds

If upgrading is not possible it's recommended to use `config.reference_types(false)`. That will disable these modules at validation-time which prevents the possibility of a panic at runtime. If reference-types are required, however, then there is no other workaround at this time other than upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
