# Panic when using a dropped extenref-typed element segment

Low

[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)
published
GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5
Apr 2, 2024

## Package

cargo

wasmtime
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

19.0.0

## Patched versions

19.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The 19.0.0 release of Wasmtime contains a regression introduced during its development which can lead to a guest WebAssembly module causing a panic in the host runtime. A valid WebAssembly module, when executed at runtime, may cause this panic. The panic in question is caused when a WebAssembly module issues a `table.*` instruction which uses a dropped element segment with a table that also has an `externref` type. This causes Wasmtime to erroneously use an empty function segment instead of an empty externref segment to perform this operation. This mismatch in types causes a panic in Wasmtime when it's asserted that an externref table is only viewed as externrefs.

This regression was introduced during the development of the 19.0.0 release and only affects the 19.0.0 release. This panic requires the `reference-types` WebAssembly feature to be enabled, and it is enabled by default. Toolchains are not known to generate this pattern by default so it's likely a module would need to be specifically crafted to trigger this panic.

A panic in a host runtime represents a possible denial-of-service in some scenarios. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.

### Patches

Wasmtime 19.0.1 has been released to fix this problem. Users of 19.0.0 should upgrade to 19.0.1. All other versions of Wasmtime are not affected by this issue.

### Workarounds

If upgrading is not possible it's recommended to use `config.reference_types(false)`. That will disable these modules at validation-time which prevents the possibility of a panic at runtime. If reference-types are required, however, then there is no other workaround at this time other than upgrading.

### @alexcrichton **[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)** commented [Apr 2, 2024](#issue-2220731321)

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in [#8018](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018) where using an element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched. The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the "functions" encoding as opposed to the "expressions" encoding. This meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an "expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however, enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes [#8281](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281)

meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for

enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (](/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/24f7f40f5ec5f96722e97abe4090195a0afa59d2 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (#8283) (#8284)

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in [#8018](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018) where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
"functions" encoding as opposed to the "expressions" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
"expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes [#8281](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281)

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type](/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/734aa7b7530d7104ccddd36301057dcd150d8511 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes #8281")`

| Thanks for the report! Do you perhaps have more detail on how this was discovered? For example is this a reduced module? Or perhaps a fuzz-generated test case?  Also as per [our documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security-what-is-considered-a-security-vulnerability.html) this is a security issue so we'll be issuing a CVE and a 19.0.1 release for this. If you discover more issues like this we'd be grateful if you'd [contact us privately](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/SECURITY.md) so we can coordinate this, thanks! |

| We are in progress of implementing a wasm fuzzer based on [SpecTec](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec/tree/main/spectec). Currently, it generates short wasm programs by a simple syntax-driven approach. We performed differential testing with the latest wasmtime and previous versions, and luckily found the bug. We reduced the buggy program manually as the generated program was simple. |

This commit is an attempt to make the mistake fixed in [#8016](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8016) harder to happen again. This removes the `set_raw` helper entirely from tables and instead forces all callers to view the table as either a table of funcrefs or a table of externefs. By forcing that choice outwards instead of handling it inwards it enables dealing with a typed table in more contexts which should help naturally do the right thing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Relative to [#8016](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8016) this was the other issue I found, this forgot to check whether the table was an externref table or funcref table and triggered a panic by assuming a global was a funcref.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type](/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/734aa7b7530d7104ccddd36301057dcd150d8511 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
\"expressions\" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

Closes #8281")`

empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
"functions" encoding as opposed to the "expressions" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
"expressions" list which means that the table type is dispatched on to
call the appropriate initializer.

There is no memory safety issue with this mistake as the assertion was
specifically targetted at preventing memory safety. This does, however,
enable any WebAssembly module to panic a host.

`[Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (](/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/24f7f40f5ec5f96722e97abe4090195a0afa59d2 "Fix a panic using tables with the wrong type (#8283) (#8284)

This commit fixes an accidental issue introduced in #8018 where using an
element segment which had been dropped with an `externref` table would
cause a panic. The panic happened due to an assertion that tables are
being used with the right type of item and that was being mismatched.
The underlying issue was that dropped element segments are modeled as an
empty element segment but the empty element segment was using the
\"functions\" encoding as opposed to the \"expressions\" encoding. This
meant that code later assumed that due to the use of functions the table
must be a table-of-functions, but this was not correct for
externref-based tables.

The fix in this commit is to instead model the encoding as an
