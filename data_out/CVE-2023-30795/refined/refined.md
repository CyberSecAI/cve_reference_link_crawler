- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process, or cause the application to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** User is tricked into opening a malicious JT file with an affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file. The user must then open this file using a vulnerable version of the software.
