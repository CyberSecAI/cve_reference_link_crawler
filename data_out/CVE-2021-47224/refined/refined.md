Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-47224.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `ll_temac` driver when handling multi-fragment sk_buff (network packet buffer). The driver was incorrectly freeing the skb structure after the first fragment's transmission was marked as completed. However, the subsequent fragments of the same skb were still being processed leading to a use-after-free condition on the DMA side.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The driver frees the `sk_buff` structure prematurely while DMA operations using its fragments are still ongoing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service, or system instability due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted network packet that will result in a multi-fragment `sk_buff` structure being created and transmitted. The vulnerability is triggered in the `temac_start_xmit` function, during the processing of the multiple fragments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system using the affected `ll_temac` driver. This could be from the local network or, if the device is exposed, from the internet.
