Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7306 (Based on the title from the vuldb submission)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `manage_block.php` file of the "Establishment Billing Management System". The vulnerability occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection. This allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL queries into the application's database interactions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:**  The vulnerability can lead to the escalation of privileges. This means an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or even gain full control of the database or application.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/manage_block.php` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Understanding of SQL:** Some familiarity with SQL injection techniques is required.
- **No Authentication Required:** Based on the information, it appears the vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication. The presence of cookies in the request doesn't seem to be relevant for the exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `/manage_block.php` script.
- The provided SQLMap command demonstrates the exploit by targeting the id parameter.
- A sample HTTP request is provided, which shows the format and vulnerable parameter.
