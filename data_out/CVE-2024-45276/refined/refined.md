Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-45276:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing authentication for access to the `/tmp` directory on the affected devices' HTTP service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties):** The web server allows access to files within the `/tmp` directory without requiring any form of authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain read access to files located in the `/tmp` directory of the device. This may expose sensitive information, including:
    - `/tmp/pport.enc`
    - `/tmp/hosts`
    - Potentially `/tmp/commit.db` or `/tmp/tmpencryptedtar` under specific conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access over HTTP without authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the device's HTTP service over the network.
- No authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Moritz Abrell of SySS GmbH.
- The affected products include "mbNET.mini" and "REX100" with firmware version <= 2.2.13
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating the ability to access files such as `/tmp/hosts`.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.3.1
- The advisory notes that other similar devices may be affected.
