The provided content describes a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in `langflow-ai langflow` version `1.0.18` or earlier.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `process_prompt_template` function in `langflow-1.0.18\src\backend\base\langflow\interface\utils.py`. This function uses a regular expression `pattern = r"\{\{(.\*?)\}\}|\{([^{}]+)\}"` to parse a user-provided template string. The `re.search` function is used in a loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The regular expression used is vulnerable to ReDoS because of the nested quantifiers and the use of `.*` which makes it prone to backtracking with specific crafted input strings. This causes the regex engine to take an extremely long time to process such a string.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted template string that will make the regular expression engine stall, consuming excessive CPU resources on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `/prompt` endpoint using the `POST` method. The `prompt_request.template` parameter transmitted by the user is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/prompt` endpoint with a malicious `template` string. No authentication is mentioned so an unauthenticated user is likely able to trigger this vulnerability.
