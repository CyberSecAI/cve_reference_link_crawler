Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6497:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The provided information directly relates to CVE-2024-6497. The Wordfence article explicitly mentions it, and the description aligns with the identified SQL injection vulnerability in the Squirrly SEO plugin.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of the `url` parameter within the `getData` method of the `controllers/Api.php` file in the Squirrly SEO plugin. Specifically, the `urldecode()` function is applied to the input without proper escaping for SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows for SQL injection through the `$url_decoded` variable, which is incorporated directly into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization:** The plugin relies solely on a token for authorization, which is available to users with "Contributor" level access or higher. There is no further validation if the user has permission for the function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the WordPress database. This is done by using the `UNION` clause to combine a malicious query with the original one. Since the plugin processes returned data by checking if a post ID exists, the attacker must craft SQL to return a valid post ID based on data they wish to exfiltrate. This can be used to extract user data, secrets, and other sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessible through the `/index.php?rest_route=/squirrly/get` REST API endpoint.
    *   The vulnerable code is in `controllers/Api.php` in the `getData` method under `case 'innerlinks':`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be a logged-in WordPress user with a "Contributor" role or higher to gain access to the token required for the vulnerable API endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to craft specific URLs to perform the SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability arises in the following code block in `controllers/Api.php` of the Squirrly SEO plugin:

```php
267   $url = esc_url_raw($request->get_param('url'));
...
281   $url_decoded = str_replace(trim(home_url(),'/'),'',urldecode($url));
...
284  $select_table = $wpdb->prepare("SELECT ID, post_content FROM `$wpdb->posts` WHERE `post_status` = %s ORDER BY ID DESC LIMIT %d,%d", 'publish', $start, $limit);
285  $query = "SELECT `ID` FROM ($select_table) as p WHERE (p.post_content LIKE '%$url%' OR p.post_content LIKE '%$url_backslash%' OR p.post_content LIKE '%$url_encoded%' OR p.post_content LIKE '%$url_decoded%')";
```
The `$url` parameter is taken and decoded and then concatenated directly in the `$query` without any sanitization. This allows for SQL injection.

The returned results from the crafted query are then parsed in the following code block:
```php
291 if ( $rows = $wpdb->get_results( $query ) ) {
292   if ( ! empty( $rows ) ) {
293      foreach ( $rows as $row ) {
294         if ( untrailingslashit( get_permalink( $row->ID ) ) <> $url ) {
295             $inner_links[] = get_permalink( $row->ID );
296          }
297       }
298   }
299 }
```
This code loops through the returned `$rows` from the query and only uses the data from `$row->ID`. The  `get_permalink()` is used to check if the id is a valid post ID.  An attacker must use a `UNION` clause to get the data and craft it so that the `ID` returned is a valid post ID. An attacker can extract information by manipulating the query to return a post id corresponding to the ASCII value of the character they are trying to exfiltrate.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 12.3.20 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "semi-blind" SQL injection because the attacker cannot directly see the results of their query. The attacker infers data based on the IDs returned.
*   The vulnerability is present because the `wpdb->prepare` function, which is used to create the `$select_table` query, is not used for the `$query` variable which uses string concatenation instead.
