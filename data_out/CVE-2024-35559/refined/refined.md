- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially modify or perform actions on the application without the user's consent or knowledge. In this specific case, the provided PoC targets the `infoMove_deal.php` endpoint and could modify settings related to "友情链接" (Friendly Links) which seems to be a configuration for external links/URLs in the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious webpage (or other means) that contains a crafted form that makes a request to the vulnerable `infoMove_deal.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious web page, or inject the malicious code/form into a trusted website/location. The attacker needs no prior knowledge of the user's session besides that they are logged in, since the attack relies on the user's browser sending the session cookie automatically.
