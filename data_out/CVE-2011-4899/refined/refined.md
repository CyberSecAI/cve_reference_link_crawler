Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-4899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `setup-config.php` installation page in WordPress. This page allows a user to install WordPress using a provided MySQL database, username and password. The vulnerability allows a malicious user to specify their own malicious MySQL server, and inject malicious PHP code and Javascript after a successful, albeit malicious, install.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **PHP Code Execution:** The `setup-config.php` page does not validate the host of the provided MySQL instance, allowing an attacker to use a MySQL database they control. This allows the attacker to install Wordpress successfully, then inject arbitrary PHP code using the WordPress theme editor.
2.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** After gaining control of the WordPress installation using their own database, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the database, which is then executed when a user visits the site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the target server, which, depending on server configuration, could lead to remote system command execution.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browsers of users visiting the WordPress site, potentially leading to credential theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious MySQL Server:** The attacker sets up their own MySQL server.
2.  **`setup-config.php`:** The attacker uses the WordPress installation page (`setup-config.php`) to install WordPress using their malicious MySQL instance.
3.  **Theme Editor:** After installation, the attacker uses the theme editor to insert malicious PHP code into a theme file.
4. **Direct Database Manipulation**: After installation, the attacker can insert malicious javascript into the database, and have that javascript execute when a victim visits the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress server to access the `setup-config.php` page.
*   **Malicious MySQL Instance:** The attacker must have their own MySQL database server accessible to the WordPress server.
*   **Basic Understanding of WordPress Setup:** The attacker needs to understand the WordPress setup process to manipulate it to their advantage.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor declined to fix the issue, as it only affects the install script, and is not generally accessible to the public after installation. They state the install page has a very small window of exposure, but as noted in the advisory, default images which include the installation page should be carefully guarded.
* The advisory also mentions that ModSecurity rules were created to detect and block this activity.
* The advisory also mentions that Trustwave's vulnerability scanning solution, TrustKeeper, has been updated to detect exposed installation scripts.
