- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing nonce validation in the `admin_init_AAPL` function and missing file type validation in the `AAPL_options_validate` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), arbitrary file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files on the affected server. This could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker forges a request and tricks a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking a link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
