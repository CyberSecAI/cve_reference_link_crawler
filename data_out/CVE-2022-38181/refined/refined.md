{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Arm Mali GPU kernel driver. It occurs because a kbase_va_region object, allocated using kbase_jit_allocate and referenced in kbase_context::jit_alloc, is freed through the shrinker mechanism, but the reference in jit_alloc is not cleared. Subsequently, this dangling pointer is used in kbase_jit_free.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use-after-free vulnerability in the Arm Mali GPU driver.",
    "Improper memory management within the Mali GPU driver.",
     "Dangling pointer in kbase_context::jit_alloc after a kbase_va_region is freed via the shrinker."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary kernel code execution and root privilege escalation by manipulating the freed memory region, gaining control of page table entries, and overwriting kernel code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a sequence of ioctl calls and memory allocation/deallocation operations within the Mali GPU driver. It can be accessed through an Android app.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within an Android app environment. They also need to interact with the Mali GPU driver by submitting specific ioctl calls to allocate JIT memory, make it evictable, and trigger memory pressure. The ability to pin the process to a specific CPU core helps ensure reliable memory manipulation."
