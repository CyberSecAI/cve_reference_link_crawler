- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer during the parsing of OXPS files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious OXPS file, or through a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction (opening a malicious file/page) is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious OXPS file or a malicious web page to the victim. No special position or privileges on the target system are mentioned.
