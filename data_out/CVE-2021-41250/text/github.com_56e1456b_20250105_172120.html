# Presence of non-blacklisted URL bypasses all other filters

Moderate

[ChrisLovering](/ChrisLovering)
published
GHSA-j8c3-8x46-8pp6
Nov 5, 2021

## Package

bot
(Python Discord)

## Affected versions

<69fdd3649e2f9a646b97e445bc4d5440440e5890

## Patched versions

>67390298852513d13e0213870e50fb3cff1424e0

## Description

When a non-blacklisted URL and an otherwise triggering filter token is included in the same message (for example, `https://pydis.com` and `卍`) the token filter does not trigger. This means that by including any non-blacklisted URL moderation filters can be bypassed.

# Reason

The following lines seem to be the culprit

[bot/bot/exts/filters/filtering.py](https://github.com/python-discord/bot/blob/e7959146d7949377d35a433ad83f0841070587d9/bot/exts/filters/filtering.py#L499-L501)

Lines 499 to 501
in
[e795914](/python-discord/bot/commit/e7959146d7949377d35a433ad83f0841070587d9)

|  | # Make sure it's not a URL |
| --- | --- |
|  | if URL\_RE.search(text): |
|  | return False, None |

Those lines cause the `_has_watch_regex_match` function to exit early if the message contains a url. This three years old line has been dragged through four commits, and it's utility seems to not have been questioned. It has only become an issue once we made the regex filter before the domain one, 10 months ago.
