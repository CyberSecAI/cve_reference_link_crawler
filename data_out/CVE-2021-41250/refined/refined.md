Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed logic in the `_has_watch_regex_match` function within the filtering module of the python-discord bot. Specifically, the function prematurely exits if it detects a URL in the message, without further checking for other potential filter tokens. This was introduced by commit `e06c777` and made relevant by commit `7294943`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Moderation Filters:** The core vulnerability is that by including any non-blacklisted URL in a message, users can bypass all token-based moderation filters.
- **Early Return:** The early exit condition within the `_has_watch_regex_match` function prevents the filter from correctly identifying and blocking messages that should have been blocked.
- **Logic Flaw:** The code assumes that if a message contains a URL, it does not need to be checked for other tokens, which is incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could bypass moderation filters, allowing them to post prohibited content that should have been blocked by the filter system.
- This could range from posting harmful, malicious, or unwanted content within the discord server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a message that includes both a URL (not on the blacklist) and a blacklisted token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Any user with the ability to send messages in the discord server can exploit the vulnerability by simply crafting a message that includes both a non-blacklisted URL and a blocked token/string.
