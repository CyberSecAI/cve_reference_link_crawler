# Presence of non-blacklisted URL bypasses all other filters

Moderate

[ChrisLovering](/ChrisLovering)
published
GHSA-j8c3-8x46-8pp6
Nov 5, 2021

## Package

bot
(Python Discord)

## Affected versions

<69fdd3649e2f9a646b97e445bc4d5440440e5890

## Patched versions

>67390298852513d13e0213870e50fb3cff1424e0

## Description

When a non-blacklisted URL and an otherwise triggering filter token is included in the same message (for example, `https://pydis.com` and `卍`) the token filter does not trigger. This means that by including any non-blacklisted URL moderation filters can be bypassed.

Credit to [@Akarys42](https://github.com/Akarys42) for this following brief

# Reason

The following lines seem to be the culprit

[bot/bot/exts/filters/filtering.py](https://github.com/python-discord/bot/blob/e7959146d7949377d35a433ad83f0841070587d9/bot/exts/filters/filtering.py#L499-L501)

Lines 499 to 501
in
[e795914](/python-discord/bot/commit/e7959146d7949377d35a433ad83f0841070587d9)

|  | # Make sure it's not a URL |
| --- | --- |
|  | if URL\_RE.search(text): |
|  | return False, None |

Those lines cause the `_has_watch_regex_match` function to exit early if the message contains a url. This three years old line has been dragged through four commits, and it's utility seems to not have been questioned. It has only become an issue once we made the regex filter before the domain one, 10 months ago.

* Don't Exit Token Filtering Early On URLs

The token filtering function would exit early if it detected a URL
within the message, but it made no extra checks to ensure there weren't
other tokens within that message that would trigger it. This made
sense when the filtering logic was written, but it's been modified since
to introduce this bug.

Regression tests included.

* Links Advisory In Token Filter Tests

Adds a link to the advisory with reasoning for the existence of the
 test.
