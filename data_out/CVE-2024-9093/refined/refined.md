Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9093

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `del.php` file. Specifically, the `list` GET parameter is directly used in an SQL query without neutralization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized input from the `list` GET parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive database information.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Availability:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the application's functionality, causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker manipulates the `list` parameter in a GET request to the `del.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `del.php` file of the "Profile Registration without Reload/Refresh 1.0" project.
- The `list` parameter from the GET request is directly incorporated into the SQL query without any form of sanitization or validation.
- SQL injection can be performed using various techniques including boolean-based blind, error-based, stacked queries and time-based blind injections.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit demonstration shows how to intercept the HTTP request with Burp Suite, save it to a file and then successfully exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical, and it's assigned CWE-89 for improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.
