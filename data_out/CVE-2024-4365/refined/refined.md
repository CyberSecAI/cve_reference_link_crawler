Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4365

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `add_iframe_url_as_param_direct` parameter within the Advanced iFrame plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `add_iframe_url_as_param_direct` parameter. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately validate or clean user input before using it to generate web pages.
- **Inadequate Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape output when rendering the vulnerable parameter, which further enables the execution of the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page. When a user accesses this page, the injected script is executed in their browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected scripts can potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information, allowing attackers to impersonate users.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the affected web page, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Malware Distribution:** Injected scripts can be used to download malware to users' computers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Settings:** Attackers leverage the vulnerable `add_iframe_url_as_param_direct` parameter in the plugin settings to inject the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to modify plugin settings.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `add_iframe_url_as_param_direct` parameter and its vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Advanced iFrame versions up to and including 2024.3.
- The issue was addressed in version 2024.4 by adding additional filters to some JavaScript parameters to increase security.
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/advanced-iframe-main-after-iframe.php` line 30.
- The fix can be seen in changeset 3090438.
