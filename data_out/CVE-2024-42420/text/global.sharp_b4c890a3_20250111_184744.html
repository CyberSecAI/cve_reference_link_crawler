# About Plural Security Vulnerabilities in SHARP Multifunctional Products (MFP)

The following security vulnerabilities were identified and may impact some MFPs that are not properly protected from outside the network with a strong admin password and/or firewall. The following is a summary of the vulnerabilities, affected models, and countermeasures:

| Vulnerability identification number | JVNVU#95063136 / See the following Detailed Information of the vulnerabilities for the CVE numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Affected models and firmware version | See the separate table below. |
| Detailed information of the vulnerabilities | * CVE-2024-42420: Some device web pages may cause device hang-up due to out-of-bounds memory reference * CVE-2024-43424: Some device web pages may cause device hang-up due to out-of-bounds memory reference * CVE-2024-45829: Some device web pages may cause device hang-up due to out-of-bounds memory reference * CVE-2024-45842: Some device web pages may cause path traversal attacks * CVE-2024-47005: Some device web pages have APIs that have improper access control authority * CVE-2024-47406: Some device web pages have an alternate path for bypassing authentication mechanism * CVE-2024-47549: Some web pages may be able to execute HTTP header injection * CVE-2024-47801: Some web pages may cause cross-site scripting attacks * CVE-2024-48870: Some web pages may cause cross-site scripting attacks |
| Condition to enable attacks using this vulnerability | To enable attackers to successfully attack the MFP using these vulnerabilities, the following conditions shall be fulfilled:  * â The attacker is able to access the corporate network to which the MFP is connected * â The attacker knows the information that users cannot know through normal operation |
| Possible impacts | If the above conditions are fulfilled, attackers may be able to :  * 1. hang the MFP up using crafted HTTP request on the MFP web page * 2. access part of the MFP functions with unintended authority * 3. access to the MFP by bypassing its authentication mechanism on the MFP web page * 4. embed a script that may lead to information disclosure, etc. in the MFP web page |
| Mitigation measures | To mitigate the security risks, ensure to protect your MFPs and apply the following countermeasures:  * â Change admin password from factory default and manage it appropriately. * â Do not connect MFPs directly to the Internet. Connect them via a firewall or similar network appliance. * â Restrict device web page access via password (enable [System Settings]-[Security Settings]-[Restrict Device Web Page Access Via Password]). * â Monitor the MFP periodically using the Audit Log functionality to see if suspicious access is observed.  If the above countermeasures are not practiced, devices may be accessed by attackers and cause data leakage. |
| Countermeasure | See [Affected models and the status of countermeasures] below. Sharp released updated firmware to mitigate these vulnerabilities for the models listed in Table 1. Regarding the models listed in Table 2, all firmware versions are affected, however, firmware support has ended. Please implement the above mitigation measures or consider discontinuing use of the product or migrating to a successor model. For details, consult your authorized Sharp service providers. |
