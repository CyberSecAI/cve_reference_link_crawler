{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The exception handler for user space memory access on the parisc architecture incorrectly uses a fixed register (%r29) to store error codes. If the compiler chooses a different register for the error code, the handler will overwrite that register's value with -EFAULT, leading to data corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumptions about register usage by the compiler in exception handling.",
      "Use of a hardcoded register for error code return in exception handling."
    ],
    "impact": "Random data corruption due to overwriting the content of a register used by the compiler for other purposes.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs when a user space memory access causes an exception and the compiler uses a different register than expected for the error code return during the exception handling.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a user-space memory access that results in a fault handled by the exception handler, and for the compiler to use a register other than %r29 for the error code. This could potentially be achieved by using unaligned memory accesses or other operations that might lead to faults."
  },
  "resolution": "The patch introduces a new approach by extending the __ex_table with an additional word. This word includes an assembler instruction that specifies the register chosen by the compiler for the error return code. The fault handler then uses this information to correctly store -EFAULT into the appropriate register, avoiding data corruption."
