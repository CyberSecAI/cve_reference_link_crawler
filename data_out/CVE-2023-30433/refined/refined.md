Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default configuration of the IBM Security Verify Access AAC module, which allows open redirects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The system, by default, doesn't validate the target URLs for redirects, making it possible for attackers to redirect users to malicious websites.
- Lack of proper validation of the target URL in the AAC module's default configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious site. This can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when processed by the vulnerable AAC module, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled site.
- This would likely involve tricking a user to click on the specially crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send a malicious URL to a user of the vulnerable system.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the system itself; the vulnerability is in how the software processes redirects.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring the `sps.targetURLWhitelist` property in the advanced configuration. This allows administrators to specify a list of allowed redirect targets, preventing redirection to arbitrary URLs.
- The `sps.targetURLWhitelist` property defaults to allow all URLs, creating the vulnerability.
- The recommended fix is to define a whitelist of allowed redirect targets.
- The document provides a specific example of how to set up the whitelist.
