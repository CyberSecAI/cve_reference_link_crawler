# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Verify Access product is vulnerable to Open Redirects (AAC module ) (CVE-2023-30433)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM Security Verify Access AAC module is vulnerable to Open Redirects after default configuration of the AAC module. An existing configuration option exists which can mitigate the issue.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-30433](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/252186)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Security Verify Access Appliance | 10.0.X |
| IBM Security Verify Access Docker | 10.0.X |

## Remediation/Fixes

**IBM encourages customers to update their systems promptly.**

The default configuration of the AAC module is vulnerable, but the Workarounds and Mitigations section below details how to update the configuration to avoid the issue.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The fix for this potential issue already exists. In the advanced configuration there is a property called:

**sps.targetURLWhitelist**

This can specify a whitelist of comma separated URLs that can be used as valid redirect targets. The default setting is to allow anyÂ  URL, but if you provide a list of valid targets, the system will reject any attempt to redirect to another URL.

For example:

**(http|https)://[www.test.com/](http://www.test.com/).\*, (http|https)://[www.ibm.com/](http://www.ibm.com/).\***

will only allow targets whose URL specifies the http or https protocol and whose host name begins with [www.test.com/](http://www.test.com/) or [www.ibm.com](http://www.ibm.com)/.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
