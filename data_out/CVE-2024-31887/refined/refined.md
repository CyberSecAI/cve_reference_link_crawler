- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability in IBM Security Verify Privilege could allow an unauthenticated actor to obtain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated actor can obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated actors, implying a network-based attack vector is possible. The specific attack method is not described but can occur remotely, without needing prior access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the IBM Security Verify Privilege application or its network interface and requires no prior authentication.
