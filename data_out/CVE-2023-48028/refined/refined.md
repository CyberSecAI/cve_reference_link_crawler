Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the different error messages returned by the Kodbox login page (`/?user/index/loginSubmit`) depending on whether the username exists or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **User Enumeration:** The system leaks information by providing distinct error messages ("User does not exist" vs. "Wrong password") based on the validity of the username provided during login attempts.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There is no rate limit on login attempts, making it possible to perform brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** An attacker can identify valid usernames on the system.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** By knowing valid usernames, attackers can attempt to brute-force passwords for those accounts, leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the login page (`/?user/index/loginSubmit`) of the Kodbox application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable Kodbox instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the response from the server to identify different messages related to different login attempt results.
- The attacker needs to have a list of usernames to test.
