How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

[#### Slider Revolution

Authenticated Stored XSS](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/revslider/wordpress-slider-revolution-plugin-6-7-11-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability)

Slider Revolution came to us with a request to audit their product for potential vulnerabilities since they wanted to make sure that their users’ websites were not vulnerable to an attack.

This blog post discusses our audit findings, which we have been authorized to publicize. If you’re a Slider Revolution user, please update the plugin to version **6.7.11** or higher.

**All paid Patchstack users are protected from this vulnerability.** Sign up for the [free Community account](https://app.patchstack.com/register) first, to scan for vulnerabilities and apply protection for only **$5 / site per month** with Patchstack.

For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Enterprise API](https://patchstack.com/for-hosts/) for hosting companies.

## **About the Slider Revolution Plugin**

[**Slider Revolution**](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/) is a premium WordPress plugin and has more than **9 million** active users. Used by everyone — from self-starting business owners to tech-savvy web developers — Slider Revolution continues to be one of the most popular plugins for WordPress.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jBBAK8Fqd8lf1XCp9EUD0Txs7phcGhOnAnljbYaI3JN8swR9Uj4IszFAHgMKm-Zh3X5SpUjyLGWs0uqlO0vOks3PciNxbLYU4b9MLlJzphV2hUqC5s67iNtE84HgOG_Km7NqdyLWAxIRFvNqcdP02IA)

While Slider Revolution may have got its start as a responsive slider plugin, users are now able to create anything from animated hero images, 3D carousels, split-screen content, one-page websites, and designs you won’t find anywhere else.

## **The security vulnerability**

This plugin experienced an unauthenticated stored XSS vulnerability. As a result, it could have allowed any unauthenticated user to steal sensitive information to, in this case, privilege escalation on the WordPress site by performing a single HTTP request.

This vulnerability occurred because the code that handles input from the user didn’t implement sanitization and output escaping on the slider’s parameter data. This case also combined with broken access control on one of the available REST API endpoints from the plugin which allowed unauthenticated users to update slider data.

Chaining both of these conditions, we were able to achieve unauthenticated stored XSS on the plugin. The unauthenticated broken access control vulnerability itself is fixed on version **6.7.0** and assigned **CVE-2024-34444**. For the authenticated stored XSS itself, it is fully fixed on version **6.7.11** and assigned **CVE-2024-34443**.

The main vulnerability, which is unauthenticated broken access control, existed in the function **init\_rest\_api**:

```
public function init_rest_api(){
	/**
		WP_REST_SERVER::READABLE = 'GET'
		WP_REST_SERVER::CREATABLE = 'POST'
		WP_REST_SERVER::EDITABLE = 'POST, PUT, PATCH'
		WP_REST_SERVER::DELETABLE = 'DELETE'
		WP_REST_SERVER::ALLMETHODS = 'GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE'
			return $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']
	**/

------- CUT HERE -------

	register_rest_route('sliderrevolution', '/sliders', array(
		'methods'				=> WP_REST_SERVER::CREATABLE,
		'show_in_index'			=> false,
		'callback'				=> array($this, 'save_slider'),
		'permission_callback'	=> array($this, 'check_nonce'),
	));
}
```

There is a custom REST API endpoint pointing to the **save\_slider** function with the **permission\_callback** set to the **check\_nonce** function. Let’s take a look at the **check\_nonce** function:

```
public function check_nonce(){
	$this->setup_exception_handler();
	$nonce	= $this->get_request_var('nonce');
	$nonce	= (empty($nonce)) ? $this->get_request_var('rs-nonce') : $nonce;
	if(wp_verify_nonce($nonce, 'revslider_actions') == false){
		//check if it is wp nonce and if the action is refresh nonce
		$this->ajax_response_error(__('Bad Request', 'revslider'));
		exit;
	}

	return true;
}
```

Notice that there was no permission check on the **check\_nonce** function, however, it only implemented a nonce value check of **revslider\_actions**. After observation, we noticed that the nonce value could be fetched by an unauthenticated user. One of the functions to display the nonce value to an unauthenticated user is the **js\_add\_header\_scripts** function:

```
public function js_add_header_scripts(){
	global $SR_GLOBALS;

------- CUT HERE -------

	$script = '<script>' . "\n";
	$script .= "	window._tpt			??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	window.SR7			??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	_tpt.R				??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	_tpt.R.fonts		??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	_tpt.R.fonts.customFonts??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.F 				??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.G				??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.LIB				??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.E				??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.E.gAddons		??= {};" . "\n";
	$script .= "	SR7.E.nonce			= '". wp_create_nonce('revslider_actions') ."';" . "\n";

------- CUT HERE -------

	echo apply_filters('revslider_js_add_header_scripts', $script);

	$SR_GLOBALS['header_js'] = true;
}
```

Back to the **save\_slider**, the function itself has only one purpose, to update any slider data including the slider parameter.

We then took a look at how the slider parameter display will be handled and noticed that some of the slider parameters were not properly sanitized or escaped, resulting in a possible authenticated stored XSS, since originally, the slider data could only be modified by administrator role or role that are specifically given access to the Slider Revolution feature. However, since there were quite many vulnerable slider parameters, we will not include them all in this article.

By chaining both the unauthenticated broken access control and the authenticated stored XSS on the slider parameters display, we were able to achieve unauthenticated stored XSS.

Note that this vulnerability was reproducible in a default installation and activation of the Slider Revolution plugin without a specific requirement or configuration. Since the XSS payload was placed on the targeted sliders, this vulnerability also could’ve been easily triggered by any user visiting the targeted sliders.

## **The patch**

Since this vulnerability mainly existed because the plugin allowed any unauthenticated users to update slider data or parameters, the vendor decided to entirely remove the affected REST API endpoint. The patch can be seen below:

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-12-1024x296.png)

For the XSS case, the vendor applied proper sanitization and escaping to the affected slider data or parameters.

## **Conclusion**

We recommend applying escaping and sanitization to any stored user input that will be displayed. Depending on the context of the data, we recommend using [**sanitize\_text\_field**](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/sanitize_text_field/) to sanitize value for HTML output (outside of HTML attribute) or [**esc\_html**](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_html/). For escaping values inside of attributes, you can use the [**esc\_attr**](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr/) function. We also recommend applying a proper permission or authorization check to the registered rest route endpoints and not providing sensitive action or process to an unauthenticated user.
