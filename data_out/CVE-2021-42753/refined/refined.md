- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as Path Traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal (CWE-22), leading to arbitrary file/directory deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can perform arbitrary file and directory deletion on the device's filesystem. This could lead to unauthorized code execution or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the FortiWeb management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated attacker with access to the FortiWeb management interface.
