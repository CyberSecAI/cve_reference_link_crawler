There is no need to return the exception details through the API as it is logged properly.

| Actually we have use cases where some information of the stacktraces are useful information.  Example: Uploading attachments which are too big: [stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck#830](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck/issues/830)  The maximum filesize is part of the stacktrace. |

| What is the benefit of less information at all? This is only useful for proprietary and closed source server applications which are doing security by obscurity.  Less transparency when trying to figure out what went wrong is not very helpful. Many [current issues with the API](https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature%3A+api%22) would have been even harder to find and analyze without stacktraces in the responses, i therefore hardly encourage you to keep the valuable information in case something went wrong. |

Both ways are okay for me, either we default to `false` here to we merge it as-is. (though that may make debugging harder as others said)

Context: This error message can leak sensitive details and should not be returned by default.

| Can you name an example for "sensitive information"? I strongly doubt that one logs passwords or stuff, which would be even worse and should be fixed in the root, not just cloaking them in an API. Maybe some kind of compromise could be to only return the `Internal server error` message for not-authenticated requests or so? |

| Can you name an example for "sensitive information"? I strongly doubt that one logs passwords or stuff, which would be even worse and should be fixed in the root, not just cloaking them in an API.  For example file paths, folder structures, etc. - Returning raw error messages isn't the right thing to do and most software won't do that for a reason. (and rather return generic error codes that you can then correlate with the error logs)  Alternatively you could use HintException or such and only display these. But that would require changing the exception throwing sites to throw these exceptions instead and make sure to not include any stack trace here. (some of these exceptions that bubble up here are from core) |

| I agree that proper hints may be a alternative solution, but i doubt the order of the implementation. This should be done *first* and *then* remove any trace that might lead to a solution.  Taking [my example from above](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck/issues/830) this should *of course* not be a `500` at all, but stripping each information we will be hopelessly lost when an error occurs. Debug mode is not a proper replacement as many users are *not* selfhosting and can't just ask their provider to switch on the debug mode.  If one would prioritize clear hints higher than removing all information i wouldn't even have an issue, but in fact by far most of the users will complain at the Android *client* if an issue occurs.  I have a feeling that we are some kind of first level support / first line of defense and i feel a bit lost if we only are able to comment "sorry, but no idea - ask your million users hoster to enable debug mode for you ü§∑". |

| I agree that proper hints may be a alternative solution, but i doubt the order of the implementation. This should be done first and then remove any trace that might lead to a solution.  As Lukas mentioned the trace may contain path and folder structures but depending on the server configuration and PHP version may also contain arguments of method calls.  If one would prioritize clear hints higher than removing all information i wouldn't even have an issue, but in fact by far most of the users will complain at the Android client if an issue occurs.  Your point if of course understandable. Nextcloud offers a hint exception in order to provide user facing texts but that is so far not used in deck unfortunately. I'll open a follow up ticket on how we can improve exception handling in general as we indeed should rather catch them in the controller and return predictable API responses then. However that is unfortunately a larger restructuring task, so this is why this PR was the first take on the topic. I'll have a look if we can get some static analysis that we have running with psalm to get a list of uncatched exceptions that the controllers might throw so we can properly align that in a follow up.  I have a feeling that we are some kind of first level support / first line of defense and i feel a bit lost if we only are able to comment "sorry, but no idea - ask your million users hoster to enable debug mode for you shrug".  For now I've extended the message that will be returned in non-debug mode to always contain a hint to further request the server administrator for help in addition with the request ID which can then be used to get the actual log entry. This is the same behavior that we have in Nextcloud on pages that throw an exception. |
