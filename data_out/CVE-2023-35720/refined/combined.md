* + The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to system configuration and your operating environment.
  + Actual data throughput and WiFi coverage will vary from network conditions and environmental factors, including the volume of network traffic, building material and construction, and network overhead, result in lower actual data throughput and wireless coverage.
  + Quoted network speeds and bandwidth based on current IEEE 802.11ac specifications. Actual performance may be affected by network and service provider factors, interface type, and other conditions. Connected devices must be 802.11ac-compatible for best results.
  + WPA/WPA2 enterprise is only available on single router, is not available under AiMesh mode.
  + When traditional QoS is enabled, there will be limitations due to the actual Internet service bandwidth and different environment, and there may be a risk of speed reduction.
  + Due to the different power supply requirements on USB external hard disk and 4G/5G Modem device, to ensure that the external device can be used stably, if the USB external device exceeds the standard USB 2.0 (5V/500mA) and USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5V/900mA) power supply requirements, you need to use it with an independent external power supply.
