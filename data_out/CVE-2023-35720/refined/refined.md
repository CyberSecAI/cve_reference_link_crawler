Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35720

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the `mod_webdav.so` module of the ASUS RT-AX92U router's firmware. Specifically, the module fails to validate user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL injection vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the router, in the context of the root user. This could include potentially accessing configuration data, credentials, or other sensitive information stored on the router.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to ASUS on 2022-03-23, and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2023-08-23.
*   ASUS has released a firmware update to address this issue. The advisory from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative references the fix and states that more details can be found at [unspecified].
*   The ASUS firmware release notes confirms the fix in version `3.0.0.4.388_23630`: "Fixed lighttpd vulnerability, CVE-2023-35720."
*   The CVSS score is 6.5 with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N which indicates it is an Adjacent Network attack, low complexity, no privileges are required, no user interaction, with no impact on system scope, with a high impact on Confidentiality only, with no impact on Integrity or Availability.
