The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10057.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was due to a flaw in the password reset functionality, specifically in the `change_password` function within the `class.securelogin.php` file. The code did not properly enforce the requirement for an activation key during the password change process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing activation key check:** The `change_password` function allowed password changes even when an empty activation key was provided.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who knew a valid username could change the password for that account without needing a valid activation key, leading to account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must know the username of the targeted user.
- The attacker must use the password reset functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have knowledge of an existing username on the system.
- The attacker needs to access the login page to trigger the password reset functionality.
