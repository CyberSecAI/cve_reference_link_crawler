- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when creating a category name. Specifically, it fails to sanitize the Category name before rendering it, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, information disclosure, defacement, or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can create a new category using a crafted name containing the malicious payload `<script>alert(1)</script>`. When this category name is rendered in the forum, the script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the category creation section.
