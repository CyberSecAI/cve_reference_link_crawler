The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the TOTOLink N350RT V9.3.5u.6139_B20201216 router firmware.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `sprintf` function where user-controlled input (`Lang` parameter) is formatted into a string `V7`. The size of the format string is not limited, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Command Injection:** While the description mentions "command injection vulnerability" the actual vulnerability is a buffer overflow leading to control of program execution, rather than directly injecting a shell command.
- **Unrestricted user input:** The `lang` parameter allows a large string to be sent, which is then directly used in the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, hijacking program control and leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **Root shell:** The attacker can eventually obtain a stable root shell on the device without authentication.
- **Device compromise:** Full control of the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
- **`lang` parameter:** The malicious payload is sent through the `lang` parameter in the JSON body of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically from within the local network or if the router's management interface is exposed to the internet.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint and parameters:** The attacker needs to know that the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint exists and is vulnerable via the `lang` parameter, and the structure of the POST request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The provided text includes proof-of-concept (POC) exploit code to demonstrate how the vulnerability can be triggered, and the steps to verify the successful execution of the exploit,
- The vulnerability can be exploited even without authenticating to the device.
- It is possible to hijack the PC register.
- The provided information also mentions that this is a command injection vulnerability, while in fact it is a stack-based buffer overflow allowing arbitrary code execution.
