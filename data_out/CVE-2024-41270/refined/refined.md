Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the use of deprecated TLS versions (1.0 and 1.1) within the `RunHTTPServer` function in `server_normal.go` of the `appleboy/gorush/router` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Use of Deprecated TLS:** The application supports TLS 1.0 and 1.1, which are known to have security weaknesses.
*   **CWE-327:** Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breaches:** Exploitation could lead to data breaches due to the known vulnerabilities in TLS 1.0 and 1.1.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers could intercept and manipulate data in transit via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Compliance Issues:** Using outdated protocols can lead to violations of industry standards, potentially resulting in penalties.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerability leads to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **Configuration Dependent:** The vulnerability is exposed when autotls is set to false, which causes the HTTP service to default to a minimum TLS version of 1.0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be in a network position to intercept or manipulate traffic between the client and the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Product:** gorush
*   **Affected Version:** <=1.18.4
*   **Affected Component:** HTTP service
