|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | Gorush v1.18.4 was discovered to use a deprecated version of TLS. |
|  |  |
|  | In the RunHTTPServer function within the server\_normal.go file |
|  | of the appleboy/gorush/router package, our server currently supports TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | Continuing to support TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 exposes our |
|  | application to potential security risks, including but not limited to: |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerabilities: TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 have known weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches or other security incidents. |
|  | Interception: The outdated protocols may allow for man-in-the-middle attacks, enabling adversaries to intercept and manipulate data in transit. |
|  | Compliance Issues: Supporting these outdated protocols may violate industry standards and best practices, potentially leading to compliance penalties or legal repercussions. |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [VulnerabilityType Other] |
|  | CWE-327 |

|  | [Impact Information Disclosure] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | ------------------------------------------ |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | After configuring autotls to false, the HTTP service used thereafter will automatically support a minimum version of tls1.0 |
