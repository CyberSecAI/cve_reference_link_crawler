Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how XWiki handles access rights when saving documents via its API. Specifically, when a user without "programming rights" (PR) saves a document, the API checks the rights of the *current user viewing the content* instead of the rights of the *script author*. This means if a privileged user (e.g., an administrator) views content containing a malicious script created by a user without PR, the script executes with the administrator's rights, allowing the script to perform actions the script's author could not do on their own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is that access control checks during document saving via the API (`api.XWiki#getDocument()` and `api.Document#save()`) use the current user's rights rather than the script author's rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This flaw allows a user to escalate privileges by creating a script that, when viewed by a privileged user, executes with those elevated rights.
*   **Script Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited through user-provided input (e.g., comments, page content, rendered text areas, user panels) that includes malicious Velocity scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Document Modification:** Attackers can modify or overwrite any documents with the same access rights as the user viewing the crafted content.
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary Velocity scripts with elevated privileges, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Creation of Programming Rights Scripts:** Malicious users can create documents containing scripts with programming rights, allowing them to gain full control of the system through the vulnerable API, if the viewer has programming rights.
*   **Loss of Control:** An administrator or other user with programming rights might lose control of the system by viewing content created by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-provided Input:** Malicious scripts can be injected through any user-provided content that is rendered by the XWiki platform. This includes comments, page content, text areas, and user panels.
*   **Velocity Scripting:** The vulnerability is exploited through the use of malicious Velocity scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Script Right (EDIT Right before XWiki 7.4):** An attacker needs to have the SCRIPT right (or EDIT right on older versions) to create content containing malicious velocity scripts
*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker can be a low-privilege user, even a guest user.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker relies on a user with higher privileges to view the malicious content, triggering the execution of the malicious script with the privileges of the victim. This requires user interaction for exploitation to be successful.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions prior to 13.0
*   **Patched Version:** The issue is fixed in version 13.0.
*   **Workaround:** The workaround is to grant SCRIPT right only to trusted users.
*   **Configuration Option:** A new configuration option `security.script.save.checkAuthor` was introduced to control whether document save API checks for the script author's rights. Setting this to false makes the API use only the current user rights. This option defaults to true in version 13.0 and higher.
*   **CVSS Score:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N, indicating a high severity issue when exploited.
