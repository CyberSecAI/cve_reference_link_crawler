#### Description

This is a major and very old security flaw.

A Velocity script, even written by guest in a comment, could be later executed with the access rights of a priviledged user (apart from the programming rights, but this could be gained later).

If an XWiki administrator look at

* the comment of an anonymous user,
* a page written by a simple user
* a rendered textarea field
* a user panels
* in fact, anything rendered from a user input...

the Velocity script is executed with all the access rights of this administrator.

The causes is that all access rights are always checked against the context.user, not against the user that have written the script (the only right the script will not have is the programming right, until the context.doc is content authored by an administrator).

Without programming rigths (PR), the API currently allows to view, create and overwrite any documents with the right access of the viewer and authoring as the viewer (api.XWiki#getDocument() and api.Document#save()).

Saving a document is the worse, since with something like this:

```
{{velocity}}
#set($docname="AnySpace.AnyDocs")
#set($newdoc=$xwiki.getDocument($docname))
$newdoc.setContent('{{velocity}}$xwiki.XWiki.evilcode{{/velocity}}')
$newdoc.save()
{{/velocity}}
{{include document="AnySpace.AnyDocs"/}}

```

you may event create and execute scripts that has Programming Rights, since the content author of the created document could be a viewer having programming rights !

Now be really careful next time you logs in with Programming Rights, you may loose control... ![](/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)

## Affected versions

>= 1.0

## Patched versions

13.0

## Description

### Impact

Any user with SCRIPT right (EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right.

### Patches

It has been patched in XWiki 13.0.

### Workarounds

The only workaround is to give SCRIPT right only to trusted users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
