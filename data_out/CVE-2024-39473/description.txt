In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Fix input format query of process modules without base extension

If a process module does not have base config extension then the same
format applies to all of it's inputs and the process->base_config_ext is
NULL, causing NULL dereference when specifically crafted topology and
sequences used.
