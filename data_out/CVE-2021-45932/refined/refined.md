{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a null-dereference WRITE in the `MqttProps_Free` function. This occurs because the code does not properly check if the `p` pointer is NULL before attempting to access its `next` member within a loop, which could lead to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a crash of the affected application due to the null pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the freeing of MQTT properties. This suggests a malformed or specially crafted MQTT packet could cause the vulnerability to trigger during parsing and cleanup.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send MQTT packets to a vulnerable `wolfMQTT` client. This could be either a malicious MQTT server or a MITM attack on the client."
