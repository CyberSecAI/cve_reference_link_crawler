Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html` class does not properly sanitize "javascript:" URLs within hyperlink `href` attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the generated HTML. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can craft a malicious Excel file (e.g., book.xlsx) containing a hyperlink with a "javascript:" URL.
*   When this Excel file is loaded and converted to HTML using `PhpSpreadsheet`, the malicious JavaScript is injected into the HTML output.
*   When a user opens the HTML in their browser and clicks the malicious link, the injected JavaScript will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Excel file with a "javascript:" hyperlink.
*   They need to have a way to get the target user to open the generated HTML. This could be by providing the HTML directly or using it in some other web application.
*   The user must interact with the generated HTML by clicking on the malicious hyperlink.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of PhpSpreadsheet (>= 2.2.0, < 2.3.0, < 1.29.2, >= 2.0.0, < 2.1.1).
*   The vulnerability is present in regular hyperlinks and `HYPERLINK()` formulas in spreadsheets.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 5.4, with a base metric string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N` indicating the following:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Changed
    *   Confidentiality: Low
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*   The weakness is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
