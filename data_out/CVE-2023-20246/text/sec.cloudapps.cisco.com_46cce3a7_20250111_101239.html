This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the access control policies are being populated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a connection to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access control rules on the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-snort3acp-bypass-3bdR2BEh>  This advisory is part of the November 2023 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: November 2023 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74985).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products For information about which products were affected by this vulnerability at the time of publication, see the sections below. Open Source Snort 3 At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Open Source Snort 3.  For information about which Snort releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. For more information on Snort, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/). Cisco FirePOWER and Firepower Threat Defense Software At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) and Cisco FirePOWER Services if they were running Snort 3.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Cisco FTD Software Snort Configuration**  On new installations of Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is running by default. On devices that were running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0 or earlier and were upgraded to Release 7.0.0 or later, Snort 2 is running by default.  To determine if Snort 3 is running on Cisco FTD Software, see [Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that.html). Snort 3 must be active for this vulnerability to be exploitable. Cisco IOS XE Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software or Cisco UTD Engine for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software.  **Note:** UTD is not installed on these devices by default. If the UTD file is not installed, the device is not vulnerable.    + 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + 4000 Series ISRs   + Catalyst 8000V Edge Software   + Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8500L Edge Platforms   + Cloud Services Routers 1000V   + Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-app-bypass-cSBYCATq#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Determine Whether UTD Is Enabled**  To determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, use the **show utd engine standard status** command. If the output shows a **Yes** under **Running**, UTD is enabled. If there is no output, the device is not affected. The following example shows the output on a device that has UTD enabled:  ```   Router# show utd engine standard status Engine version       : 1.0.19_SV2.9.16.1_XE17.3Profile              : Cloud-LowSystem memory        :             Usage  : 6.00 %             Status : GreenNumber of engines    : 1   ```   ```   Engine        Running    Health     Reason    ===========================================Engine(#1):   Yes        Green      None=======================================================   ...   ``` Cisco Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway This vulnerability affects Cisco Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway (SIG), which is cloud based.

When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases For information about fixed releases, see the sections below. Open Source Snort Software At the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate.       | Snort Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 2.x | Not vulnerable |   | 3.x | 3.1.57.0 |      Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.   5.
