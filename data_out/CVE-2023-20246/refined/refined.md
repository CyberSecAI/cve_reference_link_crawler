- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error occurs when Snort access control policies are populated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control policy implementation in Snort 3.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the configured access control policies on an affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker establishes a connection to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
