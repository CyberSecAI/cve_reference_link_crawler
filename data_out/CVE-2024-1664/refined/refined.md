- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows high privilege users, such as admins, to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. This can occur even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, such as in a multisite setup.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin-level access can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings via the "Class" field in "General Settings". When a user hovers their mouse over this field, the injected JavaScript will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the plugin's settings page and modify the "Class" field.
