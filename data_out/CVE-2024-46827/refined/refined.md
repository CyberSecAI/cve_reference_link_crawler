Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the "peer_nss" value within the ath12k WiFi driver. Specifically, during the association process, the driver receives an association request that includes Extended HE Capabilities Information Element. If this element has an invalid MCS-NSS configuration (specifically a value of 0), the driver incorrectly passes this value to the firmware, leading to a firmware crash. The root cause is the driver's failure to check if the peer\_nss value is valid before forwarding it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the `peer_nss` value before sending it to the firmware.
- **Firmware Crash:** Invalid data sent to the firmware causes it to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can send a crafted association request with an invalid MCS-NSS that will cause a crash of the WiFi firmware on the access point. This will interrupt the WiFi services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Association Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted WiFi association request with an invalid "MCS-NSS" value within the Extended HE Capabilities Information Element.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the vulnerable access point.
- **Ability to Craft Packets:** The attacker needs to have the capability to craft and send custom WiFi association requests with the malformed Extended HE Capabilities Information Element.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding a validation check to the ath12k driver to ensure that the peer\_nss is greater than zero before sending it to the firmware. If the value is less than 1, the association request will be rejected.
- The vulnerability affects devices using the `ath12k` driver with Extended HE Capabilities.
- The provided patches are nearly identical, indicating the fix was backported to multiple kernel versions.
