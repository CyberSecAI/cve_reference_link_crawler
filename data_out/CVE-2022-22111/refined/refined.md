Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-22111

**Root Cause:** Missing authorization in DayByDay CRM version 2.2.0. The application fails to properly restrict user access to modify other user's passwords and roles, including those of administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. Users with the "Update a User" permission can change other users' passwords and roles, regardless of their own privileges or departmental access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can change the password of an administrator, gaining full access to the application and its data.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** By compromising the administrator account, an attacker can take full control of the application. This includes the ability to modify, delete, or exfiltrate any data, as well as change system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network since it's a web application vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Existing User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with "Update a User" permission within the vulnerable DayByDay CRM application.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not require administrative privileges initially, as the vulnerability allows for privilege escalation.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the user update functionality of DayByDay CRM version 2.2.0.
*   Any user with "Update a User" permission can modify the password of any other user, including the administrator, by simply editing the user's profile and changing the password field.
*   The fix involves implementing proper authorization checks in the `UsersController.php` and `User.php` files to ensure only administrators or owners can change roles and passwords of other users, unless it is their own account.

**Proof of Concept:**
1.  Log in to the application as an administrator and ensure "update user" role is enabled to an "Employee" type.
2.  Log in as a low-privileged user, e.g. `alice@alice.com`, with "Update a User" permission.
3.  Navigate to the user list and select the administrator user, e.g. `admin@admin.com`.
4.  Change the administrator's password and save.
5.  Log in with the new administrator password.

**Affected Environment:**
*   `bottelet/flarepoint` version 2.2.0.
*   `Bottelet/DaybydayCRM` repo version 2.2.0.

**Prevention:**
*   Upgrade to version 2.2.1 of `bottelet/flarepoint` or `Bottelet/DaybydayCRM`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is in PHP code.
*   The fix implemented in commit `fe842ea5ede237443f1f45a99aeb839133115d8b` restricts password and role changes to only administrators/owners or the user modifying their own profile.
