   * docs: update entitymanager definition

   change the "What is EntityManager?" page to be up-to-date with v 0.3.0

   1. line 6 changes from
   `You can access the entity manager via 'getManager()' or from 'Connection'.`
   to
   `You can access the entity manager via DataSource's manager.`

   2. the import on `getManager` in line 10 becomes `Manager` that the user have configured beforehand:
   `import {getManager} from "typeorm";`
   becomes
   `import {Manager} from "./config/DataSource";`

   3.change entityManager definition in line 13:
   from
   `const entityManager = getManager(); // you can also get it via getConnection().manager`
   to
   `const entityManager = Manager;`

   * docs: update entitymanager definition

   changed line 10 from:
   `import {Manager} from "./config/DataSource";`
   to
   `import {DataSource} from "typeorm";`

   and changed line 13 and 14 from:
   `const entityManager = Manager;`
   `const user = await entityManager.findOne(User, 1);`
   to
   `const myDataSource = new DataSource({ /*...*/ });`
   `const user = await myDataSource.manager.findOne(User, 1);`

   for a simpler way of describing the origin of DataSource and how it works.

   * In return type doesn't seem to work in all cases

   * feat: mssql v7 support ([#8592](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/8592))

   Adds support for v7 of the mssql library as v6 is EOL. This also makes use of the new toReadableStream method on requests to return a native stream where required.

   * fix: prefix relation id columns contained in embedded entities ([#6977](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6977))

   metadata set to match the relation column.

   fixes: [#2254](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2254)
   fixes: [#3132](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3132)
   fixes: [#3226](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3226)
   fixes: [#6977](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6977)

   * test: prefix subcounters sub-entity with "sub" to fit in 30 character identifier for oracle

   Problem introduced with [#6981](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/6981)

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver ([#7538](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/7538))

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver

   In sqlite, Date objects are persisted as UtcDatetimeString.
   But a Date object parameter was escaped with .toISOString(), making such queries impossible.
   This commit aligns both transforms.
   This bug does *not* apply to better-sql where you can only bind numbers, strings, bigints, buffers,
   and null.
   This is breaking for when the user inserted their dates manually as ISO and relied on this old
   maltransformation, after this their find()s by Date won't work anymore.

   BREAKING CHANGE: Change Date serialization in selects
   Closes: [#2286](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2286)

   * add failing test

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver (with query builder)

   Also consider query builder parameter escaping

   * test: add test for 3426

   are not unique because they are too long and thus truncated by the driver.
