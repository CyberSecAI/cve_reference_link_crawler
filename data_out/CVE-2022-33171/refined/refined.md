{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "source": "seclists.org_6b539b5c_20250111_141417.html",
    "root_cause": "The `findOneBy` method in TypeORM v0.3, when provided with `undefined` as a value in the query, removes the parameter from the SQL query, leading to data exposure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation in the `findOneBy` method."
    ],
    "impact": "Data exposure due to the removal of query parameters when `undefined` is passed, potentially returning more records than intended.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting HTTP requests without specific parameters intended for filtering, thereby returning all the records."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "source": "seclists.org_228dd385_20250111_141418.html",
     "root_cause": "The `findOne` function in TypeORM versions prior to 0.3.0, when supplied with a user-controlled parsed JSON object, allows for SQL injection through a crafted FindOneOptions object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input to `findOne` function.",
        "Lack of input validation when user supplied a JSON object that was not an id string."
    ],
    "impact": "SQL injection leading to potential data breach or manipulation, demonstrated by a `pg_sleep` attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending a malicious crafted JSON object via HTTP request to the vulnerable application."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
