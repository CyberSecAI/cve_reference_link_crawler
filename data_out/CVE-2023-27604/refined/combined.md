Check that the connection string constructed using the connection's

`host`, `port` and `schema` does not contain query params as it is

not intended. Additionally, also disable the `extra_import_options`

and `extra_export_options` arguments accepted directly by the hook

methods but accept it as a param via the hook constructor when

initialising the hook or by passing it in `hook_params` when initialising

the hook from operators.

| Test constraints check seems to be timing out repeatedly after 80 minutes.  Yes. Seems there is a backtracking of `pip` in main (I.e. it has difficulties in solving recent constraints) after some dependency release. will take a look. |

Check that the connection string constructed using the connection's
`host`, `port` and `schema` does not contain query params as it is not
intended. Additionally, also disable the `extra_import_options` and
`extra_export_options` arguments accepted directly by the hook
methods but accept it as a param via the hook constructor when
initialising the hook or by passing it in hook_params when initialising
the hook from operators.

* Propogate missing hook param changes to the operator

* Remove test for invalid port with query param as ports are integers and not accepted by databases

* Add 4.0.0 to provider.yaml
