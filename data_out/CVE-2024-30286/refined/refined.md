Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-30286:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory locations outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leak: An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information from the application's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L). This suggests that the attacker would need local access to the vulnerable system to exploit the flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low privilege position on the system (PR:N), which means no privileges are required.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required, meaning the user needs to perform an action for exploitation to occur, such as opening a specially crafted file.
