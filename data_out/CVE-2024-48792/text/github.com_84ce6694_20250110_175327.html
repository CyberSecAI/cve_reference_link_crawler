# Vulnerability Report - com.hideez- Incorrect Access Control

**Product:** `com.hideez`

**Vendor:** [Hideez](https://hideez.com/en-int)

**Version:** 2.7.8.3

**Vulnerability Type:** Incorrect Access Control

**Severity:** High

## Description

The `com.hideez` , developed by **Hideez**, suffers from an Incorrect Access Control vulnerability during the device firmware update process. The app uses HTTP requests to download firmware updates. By reverse engineering the app, it was possible to identify the firmware download mechanism and the download link. Dynamic testing revealed that the vendor's firmware server lacks proper access control, leading to **firmware leakage**.

## Reproduction Steps

1. The `URL_MT_JSON_ALPHA, URL_MT_JSON_BETA, URL_MT_JSON_RELEASE and so on` Field values in the `ConstantsCore` class provide the necessary URL and other information required for the HTTP request. Static reverse engineering allows for the reconstruction of the complete request as follows:

2. Sending this URL request to the firmware server results in a direct response containing the latest firmware information as follows:

   > Request

   ```
   GET https://update.hideez.com/firmware/STr3/release/update.json HTTP/1.0
   User-Agent: Fiddler
   Host: update.hideez.com
   ```

   ```
   GET https://update.hideez.com/firmware/STr4/release/update.json HTTP/1.0
   User-Agent: Fiddler
   Host: update.hideez.com
   ```
   > Response:
