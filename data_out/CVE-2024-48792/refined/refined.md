Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper access control on the vendor's firmware server. The server directly serves firmware update information and firmware images without requiring authentication or authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Incorrect Access Control:** The firmware server does not implement any form of access control, allowing anyone with the correct URL to access firmware files.
* **Firmware Leakage:** Due to the lack of access control, firmware files can be freely downloaded, leading to firmware leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
*   **Download the latest firmware:** Obtain firmware updates before their official release.
*   **Analyze firmware:** Examine the firmware for vulnerabilities or proprietary information.
*   **Create malicious firmware:** Create modified firmware images containing malicious code.
*   **Distribute compromised updates:** Distribute malicious firmware updates to users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through direct HTTP GET requests to the firmware server using publicly accessible URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Reverse Engineering:**  The attacker needs to reverse engineer the mobile app to discover the structure and URLs for firmware updates.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication or special privileges are needed on the server side to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily accessible.

**Additional Details (From Content):**
* The `com.hideez` application uses HTTP requests to download firmware updates.
* The application stores URLs needed to download firmware update information in the `ConstantsCore` class.
* The firmware server responds with a JSON containing the download URL of the firmware image.
*  The vulnerability allows for the download of firmware images for different device models and versions.
* The attacker was able to download 4 different firmware files
* The vendor was using cloudflare for hosting

This information provides more details than a typical CVE description by outlining the exact attack vector, the specific lack of access control, and the potential impact of the vulnerability, including downloading, analyzing and creating malicious firmware updates.
