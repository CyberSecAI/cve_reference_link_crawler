Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8118

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect permission assignment on the alert rule write API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission:** Users with permission to write external alert instances are also granted the ability to write alert rules, which is an unintended privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can write alert rules by exploiting the overly permissive API endpoint, likely leading to unauthorized modification of alerting configurations. The ability to write alert rules could allow attackers to:
   -  Disable legitimate alerts.
   -  Create malicious alerts that could be used to create misleading visualizations/dashboards, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions or wasted resources.
   -  Potentially disrupt monitoring operations

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the alert rule write API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers must have permission to write external alert instances. This implies they already have some level of access or privileges within the Grafana system.
