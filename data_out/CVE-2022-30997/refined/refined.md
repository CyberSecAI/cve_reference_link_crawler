Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-30997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the use of **hard-coded credentials** within the Yokogawa STARDOM FCN/FCJ controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - The presence of hardcoded credentials allows unauthorized access if discovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who gains access to the hard-coded credentials can **log into the FCN/FCJ controllers.**
*   This access allows the attacker to **read and change configuration settings** of the controller.
*   The attacker can also **update the controller with tampered firmware.**
*   The ability to modify configurations and update firmware could lead to a complete compromise of the affected systems and processes.
*   The impact is more severe in dual-CPU configurations, as the hardcoded credentials only grant access in those environments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **adjacent network access (AV:A)**, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target controller.
*   The attacker needs to have **high privileges (PR:H)** to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The user interaction requires a user to perform some action (UI:R) to trigger this vulnerability.
*   The attack complexity is **high (AC:H).**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted STARDOM FCN/FCJ controller.
*   The attacker must be able to sniff network traffic or otherwise gain access to the hardcoded credentials.
*   The attacker would need to have a privileged user account (High privilege) to trigger this exploit.
*   The attacker would need to make the target perform a certain action to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects STARDOM FCN/FCJ controllers, specifically versions R4.10 through R4.31.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable only in dual-CPU configurations.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 6.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply packet filtering on the FCN/FCJ controller to only allow connections from trusted hosts.
*   Ensure that network traffic cannot be captured by unauthorized users via network segmentation and controls.
*   It's recommended to update the FCN/FCJ basic software to R4.20 or later to use the packet filter function.
