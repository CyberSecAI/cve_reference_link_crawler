{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The issue arises from a double call to the function responsible for unplugging auxiliary devices during a reset. This occurs because the function is called both within the IDC callback (when aux drivers request a reset) and in the ice_prepare_for_reset function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double execution of the aux device unplug function during a reset.",
      "Incorrect placement of device unplug logic, leading to potential race conditions and scheduling issues."
    ],
    "impact": "The double call to unplug aux devices during a reset leads to a 'scheduling while atomic' BUG, causing the system to crash. This is due to attempting to schedule within a critical section.",
    "attack_vectors": "A peer initiated reset of the aux drivers triggers the IDC callback which calls the function to unplug the aux devices, while the same function is also called during the normal reset flow.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to trigger a reset of the auxiliary devices."
  },
    "fixes": [
        "The aux device unplug logic was moved to the `prepare_for_reset` function which is a common place for all reset flows."
    ],
  "details": "The provided code snippets reveal that the `ice_unplug_aux_dev` function was being called in both the IDC callback triggered by aux drivers and within the `ice_schedule_reset` function, leading to the double call and the resulting crash. The fix involves removing the call to the `ice_unplug_aux_dev` from the `ice_schedule_reset` and relying solely on the call within `ice_prepare_for_reset`."
