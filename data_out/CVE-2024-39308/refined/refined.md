{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `rails_admin` gem's list view was not properly escaping HTML in the `title` attribute of table cells, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly-escaped HTML in the `title` attribute of table cells.",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts through a field's content. When a user views the list page, the injected script would execute in the user's browser within the context of the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user would need to store crafted data with embedded JavaScript within a field of a model managed by `rails_admin` that is then displayed in the list view.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to create or modify records within the `rails_admin` interface. This typically means having at least low-level access to the administrative backend of the application."
