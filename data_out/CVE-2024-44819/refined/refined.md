Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `admin/del.php` file. Specifically, the value of the `pagename` parameter, is directly embedded into the HTML response via JavaScript without any form of sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes input from the `pagename` parameter and reflects it back to the user in the context of a JavaScript redirect.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `pagename` parameter, leading to its execution in the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** The attacker can steal user session cookies and other sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page.
- **Other malicious activities:** The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a specially crafted `pagename` parameter.
- **Referer header:** The provided exploit mentions a specially crafted Referer header, but the provided exploit payload does not utilize a Referer header. The vulnerability is specifically in the handling of the `pagename` POST parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the server.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking on the malicious URL containing the crafted payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `admin/del.php` at line 89: `echo "<script>location.href='" . $pagename . "'</script>";`
- The exploit payload is: `POST pagename="><ScRipt>alert(1)</ScRipt><a>&tablename=zzcms_zixun&id=1`

This information aligns with the standard description of a reflected XSS vulnerability and provides more specific details on the vulnerable code and payload.
