Information Disclosure

## Affected component(s)

```
File: admin/del.php
Line: 89
Vulnerable Code:
echo "<script>location.href='" . $pagename . "'</script>";

```

## Attack vector(s)

```
Type: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Exploit: An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes a specially crafted Referer header. When a victim clicks on this URL, the malicious script embedded in the Referer header will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

Payload:POST pagename="><ScRipt>alert(1)</ScRipt><a>&tablename=zzcms_zixun&id=1

```

## Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE

```
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in admin/del.php at line 89. The application directly inserts the value of the parameter "pagename" into the HTML response without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, which includes a malicious Referer header. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially resulting in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
