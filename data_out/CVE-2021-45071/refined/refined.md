Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of uploaded file names within the "binary field widget" of the Odoo framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (uploaded file names), which can lead to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the browser of a victim.
- This can potentially lead to:
  - Privilege escalation by triggering malicious actions by a privileged victim.
  - Capture of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network exploitable.
- Attackers can control the contents of the vulnerable "binary field widget" either directly or indirectly (e.g., via email).
- This vulnerability can be triggered through crafted uploaded file names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not necessarily need a user account.
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the content of the vulnerable "binary field widget," which includes uploading files with malicious filenames.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), as the victim's browser must execute the injected script.
- The attack complexity is considered high (AC:H).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions, version 15.0 and earlier.
- Patches are available for versions 13.0, 14.0 and 15.0 (and respective Enterprise versions).
- No workaround is available and updating to the latest revision or applying the corresponding patch is strongly recommended.
