  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2024-9355": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an uninitialized buffer length variable in the CGO bindings of the golang-fips package, specifically affecting the (*boringHMAC).Sum() function when in FIPS mode.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The primary weakness is the presence of an uninitialized buffer length variable. This leads to the possibility of a zeroed buffer being returned by the `(*boringHMAC).Sum()` function."
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious user may intermittently receive a zeroed buffer instead of a valid cryptographic hash. This can lead to a false positive match between a trusted computed HMAC sum and an untrusted input sum if the attacker controls the input. Additionally, it is possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value. This can have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.",
         "attack_vectors": [
            "An attacker could exploit this by sending crafted inputs to a service that uses the vulnerable `(*boringHMAC).Sum()` function in FIPS mode.",
            "The attacker needs to be able to influence the input of the hmac function to cause an uninitialized buffer to be used"
          ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path, specifically, influence the input to cause an uninitialized buffer to be used within the hmac function in FIPS mode. The attack is intermittent and depends on stack layout. The attacker must also be in a position to observe or use the output of the affected hmac function."
