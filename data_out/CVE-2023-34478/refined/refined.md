Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-34478

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in Apache Shiro. When Shiro is used in conjunction with APIs or web frameworks that route requests based on non-normalized paths, it becomes susceptible to exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core issue is that Shiro doesn't properly handle non-normalized paths (e.g., paths containing "..", "." etc). This can lead to the application accessing files and resources outside of the intended directory.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the path traversal, it can lead to an authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data by traversing the file system.
- **Addition or Modification of Data:** The attacker could potentially alter system data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could cause the system to become unavailable.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Exploitation occurs via network requests, targeting vulnerable applications and APIs using Apache Shiro.
- **Non-normalized requests:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires sending non-normalized paths within the HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:**  The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability
- **Network access** : The attacker needs to send network requests to the target application

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Shiro before 1.12.0
- Apache Shiro before 2.0.0-alpha-3

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache Shiro version 1.12.0 or later, or version 2.0.0-alpha-3 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

- NetApp products are affected if they use vulnerable versions of Apache Shiro.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS score of 9.8.
