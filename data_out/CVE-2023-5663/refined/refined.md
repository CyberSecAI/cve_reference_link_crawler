Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5663

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and a lack of proper sanitization in SQL queries within the "News Announcement Scroll" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's shortcode functionality is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input when constructing SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
*  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the `group` parameter passed to the shortcode.
* **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not use prepared statements when building the SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database. This could include user credentials, site settings, and other confidential data.
*  **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, a successful SQL injection could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server via the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered via the plugin's shortcode functionality. The shortcode allows users to display announcements on the front-end of the website. Attackers can inject SQL through a crafted shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level permissions. This means they need to have the ability to create posts or pages on the WordPress site where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode:**  The attacker must know how to use the vulnerable shortcode and the plugin's structure.
*  **Crafting Malicious SQL:** The attacker must be able to construct a valid SQL injection payload that will extract the desired data.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in the `news_shortcode` function of the `news-announcement-scroll.php` file, and the `gAnnounce.php` file. Specifically, the `group` attribute of the shortcode is vulnerable.
* The vulnerability exists in versions of the News Announcement Scroll plugin up to and including 9.0.0.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 9.1.0.

The provided content also includes the changes introduced in version 9.1.0, which include using `$wpdb->prepare` to sanitize input and construct safe SQL queries, as well as escaping the group parameter with `esc_sql`.
