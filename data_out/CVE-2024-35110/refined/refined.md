```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `$gourl` variable in `yzmphp/core/class/application.class.php`. Specifically, when `$gourl` is not empty, it is directly concatenated into a meta tag without proper escaping using `htmlspecialchars`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions. In this case, the attacker can steal the user's cookie.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious link with the `referer` parameter that contains the XSS payload. When a logged-in user clicks on this link, the injected script executes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a logged-in user to click on it. This requires social engineering or some other method of luring the user to the malicious link."
