  "CVE-2024-26805": {
    "Description": "The provided commits address a kernel infoleak after free vulnerability in the netlink subsystem. Specifically, the `netlink_to_full_skb()` function incorrectly calculates the length of the data to copy when creating a new socket buffer (skb). This function uses `skb_end_offset(skb)` which includes the tailroom instead of using `skb->len`, leading to copying uninitialized kernel memory into the new skb. When this new skb is used to copy data to user space, it can lead to a kernel info leak.\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because when a new skb is created, the tailroom portion of the buffer is uninitialized. By using `skb_end_offset(skb)`, the code copies the data and uninitialized tailroom, which can leak kernel data to user space.\n",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect calculation of data length in `netlink_to_full_skb()` function leads to copying uninitialized memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of `skb_end_offset(skb)` instead of `skb->len` when allocating and copying data into a new skb.",
        "Uninitialized memory in the tailroom of newly created skbs"
    ],
    "Impact": "Kernel information leak. Potentially sensitive kernel data could be leaked to user space.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path by sending specific netlink messages that lead to the creation of a new socket buffer, which will then copy uninitialized memory from the tailroom. The information could then be obtained by reading from the socket.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to send netlink messages, which is generally achievable by a local user. No special permissions are required to trigger the vulnerability. Also, the attacker must be able to receive the netlink messages."
