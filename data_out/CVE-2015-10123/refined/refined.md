The provided content is related to CVE-2015-10123.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the web-based management interface of WAGO's programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This occurs due to insufficient checking of the input size when handling data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full access to the device by triggering the buffer overflow.
- This can lead to remote code execution, which could compromise data and allow for the execution of malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specifically crafted packets to the affected device.
- If an authenticated user then views that data in a specific page of the web-based management, a buffer overflow will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device.
- The attack requires user interaction, as an authenticated user needs to view the crafted data in the web-based management interface.
