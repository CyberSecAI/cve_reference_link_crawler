Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically through the `word` parameter. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. This allows attackers to inject their own SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **High Confidentiality Impact (VC:H):** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **High Integrity Impact (VI:H):** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **High Availability Impact (VA:H):** Attackers might cause disruptions or complete system unavailability.
*   Remote authenticated users can execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `word` parameter, used within the online dictionary function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges (PR:L):** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the platform.
*   **No Interaction Required (UI:N):** No user interaction beyond the initial request is necessary for the exploitation.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the online dictionary function.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Huachu Easytest Online Learning Test Platform version 24E01 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Cheng Ying Hsieh (Vance Hsieh) of ZUSO ART.
*   The CVSS 4.0 base score is 8.7 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
