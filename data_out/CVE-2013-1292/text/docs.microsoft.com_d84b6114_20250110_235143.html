## Vulnerabilities in Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Elevation Of Privilege (2829996)

Published: April 09, 2013 | Updated: April 24, 2013

**Version:** 3.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to the system and runs a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the most severe vulnerabilities.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Update FAQ

**Why was this bulletin revised** **on April 23, 2013? What happened to the original 2823324 security update?**

To address known issues with security update 2823324, Microsoft rereleased bulletin MS13-036 to replace the 2823324 update with the 2840149 update for NTFS.sys when installed on all affected versions of Microsoft Windows. Security update 2823324 was expired on April 11, 2013. Microsoft strongly recommends that customers with the 2823324 update still installed should uninstall the update prior to applying the 2840149 update. All customers should apply the 2840149 update, which replaces the expired 2823324 update.

**I used MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs Repair Disk ISO to boot and remove** **the** **2823324** **update.** **Should I apply the** **April 23, 2013rereleased update** **(2840149)?**

Yes. Customers who used the Microsoft Repair Disk ISO, available through the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=f027c73b-6860-46d4-af27-e25f9e7698f6), to return their computers to a normal operating state should apply the 2840149 update.

**I already successfully installed the original 2823324** **security** **update and am not experiencing any difficulties. Should I apply the** **April 23, 2013** **rereleased update (2840149)?**

Yes. On April 11, 2013 Microsoft provided guidance that all customers should uninstall security update 2823324, and expired the associated packages. In situations where customers did not uninstall the original update, they should apply the rereleased update (2840149), which replaces the expired 2823324 update. Customers do not need to uninstall the expired 2823324 update before applying the 2840149 update; however, Microsoft strongly recommends it. Customers who do not remove the expired update will retain a listing for 2823324 under installed updates in Control Panel.

**I uninstalled the original 2823324** **security** **update. Should I apply the** **April 23, 2013 rereleased update (2840149)?**

Yes. To be protected from CVE-2013-1293, all customers should apply the rereleased update (2840149), which replaces the expired 2823324 update.

**What if I experienced difficulties restartingmy system** **after installing** **security update** **2823324?**

To help customers who are experiencing difficulties restarting their systems after installation of security update 2823324, Microsoft is making available a bootable media ISO image through the Microsoft Download Center (DLC). Customers who cannot successfully restart their systems after applying the 2823324 update can download this image to create a bootable DVD or USB drive with which they can boot their systems, uninstall security update 2823324, and return their systems to a normal operating state. Please see the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=f027c73b-6860-46d4-af27-e25f9e7698f6) for additional guidance and to download the ISO.

Microsoft recommends using this ISO image only if customers cannot successfully restart their systems. Customers who can restart normally should not use this ISO image and should instead refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2839011](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2839011) for instructions on how to uninstall security update 2823324.

**What is an ISO image?**

An ISO image is means of distributing software to facilitate writing or Ã¢ÂÂburningÃ¢ÂÂ the image to removable bootable media such as DVDs. The ISO image comprises every written sector of an optical disc, including the optical disc file system.

**Why was this bulletin revised on April 11, 2013?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to address known issues associated with installation of security update 2823324. Microsoft is investigating behavior where systems may fail to recover from a restart or where applications fail to load after this security update is applied. Microsoft recommends that customers uninstall this update. As an added precaution, Microsoft has removed the download links to the 2823324 security update. For instructions on how to uninstall this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2839011](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2839011).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**There are multiple update packages available for** **some affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows Server software can be applied in any sequence.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.

**What is the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)?**

Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode device driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What is the Windows kernel?**

The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application designed to increase privileges.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

## Win32k Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-1291

A denial of service vulnerability exists when Windows fails to handle a specially crafted font file. The vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding and restart.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-1291](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-1291).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClientservice** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **Startuptype** to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround**.Â When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround**.

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClientservice** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **Startup** type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article,Â [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround**.Â Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround**.Â Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, seeÂ [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents TrueType fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer.
