- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User-provided input is not sanitized in the "Settings > Access Control" configuration interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: User-provided input through the "Settings > Access Control" configuration interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the "Settings > Access Control" configuration interface to provide malicious input.
