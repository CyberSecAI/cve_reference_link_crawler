- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `SaveRestoreConnector` of NVIDIA NeMo, where an unsafe extraction of a `.tar` file can lead to a path traversal issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the paths within the `.tar` file during extraction, leading to a path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution and data tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system where NVIDIA NeMo is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to provide a malicious `.tar` file to be processed by the `SaveRestoreConnector` component. The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
