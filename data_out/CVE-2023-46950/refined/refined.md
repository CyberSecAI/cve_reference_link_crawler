  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sidekiq-unique-jobs` web UI does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in certain GET request parameters, leading to reflected XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Potential for uncontrolled resource consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they visit a malicious link. This can lead to stealing cookies, session data, or local storage data, potentially compromising the application using the `sidekiq-unique-jobs` web UI.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted GET request parameters",
      "Social engineering to trick users into clicking malicious links",
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with XSS payloads and entice a user with access to the sidekiq-unique-jobs web UI to click the link. The attacker can be a super-user or someone who can socially engineer an authorized user.",
