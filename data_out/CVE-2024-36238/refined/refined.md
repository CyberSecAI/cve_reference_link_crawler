- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause of the vulnerability is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when user-provided input is stored on the server and is later displayed without proper sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is Stored XSS (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the Stored XSS vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). A user with low privileges (PR:L) must be tricked into triggering the stored XSS by clicking a link (UI:R). The scope is changed due to the XSS execution context (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the system that is then stored and displayed to a victim. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious script. The victim needs to be tricked into clicking a link (UI:R).
