- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unauthenticated provisioning web server in the Out-of-Band (OOB) Plug and Play (PnP) feature of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) allows arbitrary file reads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to the provisioning web server leading to directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files within the PnP container, which could facilitate further attacks on the PnP infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors:** Direct web requests to the vulnerable provisioning server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send web requests to the data network interface of the vulnerable system. No authentication is needed.
