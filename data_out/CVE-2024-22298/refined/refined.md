- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions they should not be authorized to do.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable function within the plugin that lacks proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
