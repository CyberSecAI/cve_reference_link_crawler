- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Business Card" lacks CSRF checks in certain areas, specifically when deleting business cards.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting business cards without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that, when submitted, triggers the card deletion action. The victim needs to be logged into the WordPress admin panel and to open the malicious HTML file/page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and deliver the malicious HTML document to a logged-in administrator of the affected WordPress site. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
