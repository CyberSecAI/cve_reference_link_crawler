| We do not have a struct `Phone` nor a function `validate_str` that accepts random hexadecimal numbers. We should probably, however, document the panicking behaviour, and clarify that national numbers larger than 56 bits do not exist to our knowledge. |

| Normally we deal with external untrusted characters. But the `validate_str` procedure can return `Result<T,E>` instead of crashing the program. |

| `NationalNumber::new` is not supposed to take untrusted data, and it certainly does not accept characters. The `PhoneNumber::from_str` implementation might parse into a number of more than 56 bits and feed it to `NationalNumber::new`. It might be interesting to find an actual case for that. |

| This issue needs more context or an example crash, or any other evidence to be actionable. I'm closing this for now. |

| [@12089897411](https://github.com/12089897411) I started playing with proptests soon after I closed this issue, and the panic actually showed up in a code path. I've patched this as per your suggestion, bubbling up the error. Thanks for reporting. |
