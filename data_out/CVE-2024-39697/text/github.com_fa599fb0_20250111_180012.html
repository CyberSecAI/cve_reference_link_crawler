This reduces the stack size of a PhoneNumber from 576 to 512 bits, by compressing the zeroes prefix into the value of the NationalNumber. The external API stays the same, but we win a precious 8 bytes because of alignment. If you don't have Carriers or Extensions, this is all on the stack too. Pretty cool.

We might be able to win 16 bits in `Code` too, but that'll need more trickery that might make it slightly less Rusty.

I got nerd sniped. Will spin up some benchmarks to make sure this is not too bad in terms of performance.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| LGTM! Just curious: what brought you to this part of the code? smile  I was refactoring Whisperfish to use UUID and PhoneNumber instead of two strings in the database model, and then I assumed that PhoneNumber would probably be represented terribly inefficiently, compared to our previous model. I was wrong, but then spotted this. Very much nerd sniped. |
