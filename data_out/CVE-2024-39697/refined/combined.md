| Normally we deal with external untrusted characters. But the `validate_str` procedure can return `Result<T,E>` instead of crashing the program. |

| `NationalNumber::new` is not supposed to take untrusted data, and it certainly does not accept characters. The `PhoneNumber::from_str` implementation might parse into a number of more than 56 bits and feed it to `NationalNumber::new`. It might be interesting to find an actual case for that. |

| [@12089897411](https://github.com/12089897411) I started playing with proptests soon after I closed this issue, and the panic actually showed up in a code path. I've patched this as per your suggestion, bubbling up the error. Thanks for reporting. |

# panic on parsing crafted phonenumber inputs

High

[rubdos](/rubdos)
published
GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687
Jul 9, 2024

## Package

cargo

phonenumber
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.3.4, <0.3.6

## Patched versions

>=0.3.6

## Description

### Impact

The phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a reachable `assert!` guard on the phonenumber string.

In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the "number" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56.

Since [f69abee](https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/f69abee1481fac0d6d531407bae90020e39c6407)/0.3.4/[#52](https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/pull/52).

0.2.x series is not affected.

### Patches

Upgrade to 0.3.6 or higher.

### Workarounds

n/a

### References

Whereas [#69](https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/issues/69) did not provide an example code path, property testing found a few: `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @rubdos **[rubdos](/rubdos)** commented [Apr 11, 2023](#issue-1663084058)

This reduces the stack size of a PhoneNumber from 576 to 512 bits, by compressing the zeroes prefix into the value of the NationalNumber. The external API stays the same, but we win a precious 8 bytes because of alignment. If you don't have Carriers or Extensions, this is all on the stack too. Pretty cool.

We might be able to win 16 bits in `Code` too, but that'll need more trickery that might make it slightly less Rusty.

I got nerd sniped. Will spin up some benchmarks to make sure this is not too bad in terms of performance.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| LGTM! Just curious: what brought you to this part of the code? smile  I was refactoring Whisperfish to use UUID and PhoneNumber instead of two strings in the database model, and then I assumed that PhoneNumber would probably be represented terribly inefficiently, compared to our previous model. I was wrong, but then spotted this. Very much nerd sniped. |

| Looks like it's about 10% slower on Zen 1, but there seems to be a lot of room for improving the parser performance anyway.  This is on my i5-5200U laptop:  ``` parse/+1 520 878 2491   time:   [1.0924 µs 1.1045 µs 1.1201 µs]                         change: [-10.809% -7.0258% -3.1920%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)  ```  ``` parse/+1-520-878-2491   time:   [502.38 ns 508.15 ns 515.20 ns]                         change: [-8.6393% -6.1105% -3.7750%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)  ``` |
