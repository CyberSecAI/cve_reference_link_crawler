- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The files published as part of request_store 1.3.2 have 0666 permissions, making them world-writable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect default permissions (CWE-276), leading to world-writable files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local users can execute arbitrary code by modifying the world-writable files.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system where the vulnerable package is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have local user access to the system where the vulnerable `request_store` gem is installed.
