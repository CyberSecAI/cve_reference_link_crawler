Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-44164:

**CVE-2023-44164:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation for the 'Email' parameter in the `process_login.php` resource. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi). The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks via the `Email` parameter in the `process_login.php` file.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the SQLi vulnerability can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database, potentially leading to complete system compromise or data breaches.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector is remote and requires sending a crafted request with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `Email` parameter to `process_login.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any authentication or special access to exploit this vulnerability. A remote attacker can send the malicious request over the network to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

The vulnerable code snippet within `process_login.php` is:
```php
include('config.php');
session_start();
$email = $_POST["Email"];
$pass = $_POST["Password"];
$qry=mysqli_query($con,"select * from tbl_login where username='$email' and password='$pass'");
```

This code takes the value from the POST parameter `Email` and directly embeds it within an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that there are also other SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the same application, specifically  CVE-2023-44163 and CVE-2023-44166, located in `process_search.php` and `process_registration.php` respectively.
*   The vendor page is identified as `https://projectworlds.in/`, which is a website providing free project source code.
*   There is no patch currently available for the identified vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Andres Roldan from Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
