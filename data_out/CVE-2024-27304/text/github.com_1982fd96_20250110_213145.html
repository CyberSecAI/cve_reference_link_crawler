```
pgx v5 was not vulnerable to [CVE-2024-27289](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m7wr-2xf7-cm9p "CVE-2024-27289") do to how the sanitizer was
being called. But the sanitizer itself still had the underlying issue.
This commit ports the fix from pgx v4 to v5 to ensure that the issue
does not emerge if pgx uses the sanitizer differently in the future.
