## Unsafe Environment Handling in MuranoPL

### Summary

The Murano service's MuranoPL extension to the YAQL language fails to sanitize the supplied environment, leading to potential leakage of sensitive service account information. Murano is an inactive project, so no fix is currently under development for this vulnerability. It is strongly recommended that any OpenStack deployments disable or fully remove Murano, if installed, at the earliest opportunity.

### Affected Services / Software

Murano (all versions)

### Discussion

The YAQL interpreter project has released a new major version (3.0.0) which removes support for format strings, a feature necessary to exploit this condition in MuranoPL. Because Murano is not considered under active maintenance in OpenStack, its complete removal from all deployments is still strongly advised.

Note that this behavior change in YAQL means configurations relying on string formatting will no longer be interpreted the same after upgrading, which could cause them to not work as intended by their users in services which accept YAQL (including Heat and Mistral). Reliance on that feature is considered to be unusual, but users should be made aware in case it negatively impacts their configuration.

### Recommended Actions

Disable the Murano service in, or fully remove it from, all OpenStack deployments at the earliest opportunity.
