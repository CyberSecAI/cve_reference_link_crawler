Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The default configuration of the built-in build cache in Gradle Enterprise prior to version 2021.4.2 allowed anonymous write access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted write access to the built-in build cache.
- Lack of access control on the built-in build cache by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor with network access to the build cache could populate it with manipulated entries.
- These manipulated entries could execute malicious code as part of a build, leading to remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the vulnerable Gradle Enterprise instance.
- Specifically, access to the built-in build cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the Gradle Enterprise server.
- Ability to write to the built-in build cache, which is open by default.

**Additional Notes:**
- Remote build cache nodes are not affected as they are inaccessible by default.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Gradle Enterprise 2021.4.2 by making the built-in build cache inaccessible by default, requiring explicit configuration.
- Administrators are advised to review their settings if they have been using default configurations to determine if they require open access.
