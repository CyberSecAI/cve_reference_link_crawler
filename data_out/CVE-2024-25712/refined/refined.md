Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** Not assigned (N/A) in the provided content, but the vulnerability is addressed in commit b7d83e8 which is associated with CVE-2024-25712.

**Root Cause:**
- The `http-swagger` library, prior to version 1.2.6, did not properly restrict HTTP methods when handling requests. Specifically, the `WrapHandler` function allowed the PUT method, which was then handled by the `handlePut` function.
- The `handlePut` function would take the body of the request and store it as a file in memory via `*webdav.memFile`, without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper HTTP Method Handling:** The application did not enforce restrictions on HTTP methods, allowing the use of PUT, which was not intended for the swagger UI.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The PUT method enabled an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server's memory without proper checks.
- **Stored XSS:** By uploading an HTML file containing malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the browsers of users accessing the affected URL, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, leading to user data theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
- **Potential Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary focus of the blog post, the ability to upload numerous large files with PUT could exhaust server memory, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker sends a crafted PUT request to the `/docs/` endpoint with the malicious HTML content as the request body.
- The attacker then shares the URL to that file with other users, causing the malicious script to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP PUT requests to the `/docs/` path.
- No prior authentication is needed to perform this attack, as the `/docs/` path is typically publicly accessible for Swagger UI.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post clarifies that the fix in version 1.2.6 primarily focused on restricting methods to only GET, seemingly to prevent DoS, but it also incidentally fixed the XSS issue described.
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= v1.2.5 of the `swaggo/http-swagger` library and fixed in v1.2.6.
