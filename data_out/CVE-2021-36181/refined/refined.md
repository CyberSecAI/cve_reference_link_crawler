- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper thread synchronization when accessing the customer database interface. Specifically, a race condition exists where concurrent execution using shared resources can lead to inconsistencies in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition (CWE-362) due to lack of proper synchronization in database operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated, low-privilege user can bring the database into an inconsistent state.
- **Attack vectors:** Specific coordination of web requests to the FortiPortal application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated, low-privilege user.
