- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource within the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows. This allows a local user to modify the installation directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A local privilege escalation (PE) vulnerability. Specifically, the GlobalProtect installation directory and its contents can be modified by non-administrative Windows users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user can execute programs with elevated privileges by modifying the application's installation directory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to a Windows system with a vulnerable version of the GlobalProtect app installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with the ability to write to the GlobalProtect installation directory is required.
