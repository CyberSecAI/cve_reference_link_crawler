| I think, the best soultuion is to support our sanitization config at the `pasteConfig.tags` configuration:  ```   static get pasteConfig() {     return {       tags: [ 'img[src]' ],  // <-- all attributes except 'src' will be stripped     };   } ``` |

[@jorgectf](https://github.com/jorgectf) We are planning to integrate the library you recommended in our next release because accordingly, we need to update every tool with the API. So, this is just a hotfix right now. |

So I know it will take updated value from `simple-image` tool |

| The solution still does not work as expected. If a Tool does not specify the sanitizer config, all attributes should be removed. For now, it doesn't work.  I'm digging into it. |

| Sorry, the last test became a problem and I've spent some time on it. I've found the bug with our sanitizing dependency HTMLJanitor. It has a bug with Table sanitizing ([guardian/html-janitor#3](https://github.com/guardian/html-janitor/issues/3)) so I've added a few lines to handle that case. Now all the tests work fine. |
