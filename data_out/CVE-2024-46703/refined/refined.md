The provided content shows two different commits that revert a previous change in the Linux kernel. Both commits address the same issue, so they are related to the same CVE. The problematic commit, identified as `68e6939ea9ec`, attempted to keep the console power domain always on if console suspend was disabled. This caused a crash during suspend on platforms that do not use PM domains.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The commit `68e6939ea9ec` incorrectly assumed the presence of PM domains and tried to manipulate the genpd flags of the console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code incorrectly tried to access `dev->pm_domain` on platforms where it is not valid leading to NULL pointer dereference and hence, crash.
- The code did not account for scenarios where the console doesn't use power domains causing unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The buggy code lead to a crash during the suspend process on systems without PM domains.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the system suspend process when a console is active via a serial port. No external attacker interaction is involved, making this a local denial of service condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger a system suspend on a vulnerable system which does not have PM domains enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The revert commits remove the logic added by `68e6939ea9ec`, effectively fixing the issue.
- The fixes involve removing the code that modifies the power domain flags and removing the conditional logic that depends on PM domains.
