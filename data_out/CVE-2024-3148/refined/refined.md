- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL time-based blind injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the `makehtml_archives_action.php` file within the update section of DedeCMS V5.7.112. It is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability, meaning the attacker can't directly see the results of their query but can infer information based on the time it takes for the query to execute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the update section of DedeCMS, specifically the `makehtml_archives_action.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `makehtml_archives_action.php` file, which might require access to a specific part of the application that allows triggering the update.
