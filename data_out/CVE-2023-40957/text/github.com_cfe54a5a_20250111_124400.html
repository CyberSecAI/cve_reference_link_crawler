## CVE ID

**CVE-2023-40957**

## Description

**SQL injection vulnerability** in Didotech srl Engineering & Lifecycle Management (aka `pdm`) v.14.0, v.15.0 and v.16.0 fixed in pdm-14.0.1.0.0, pdm-15.0.1.0.0, and pdm-16.0.1.0.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to **execute arbitrary code** via the `request` parameter in `models/base_client.py` component.

## Affected product

**Engineering & Lifecycle Management**

## Technical name of affected product

`pdm`

## Link to the Odoo Apps Store

<https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/16.0/pdm/>

## Vulnerability type

SQL injection

## Impact

Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure

## Affected components:

* `models/base_client.py:pml_config_settings::GetUpdateTableData(request, default)`

## Attack vectors

A portal user or internal user of an Odoo instance with the `pdm` module installed can trigger the `GetUpdateTableData` method using the External API, passing a crafted `request` parameter containing an SQL query of its choice that will be injected to the existing SQL query and executed through the database cursor.

## Proof-of-Concept

Note

A recorded demo of the PoC as well as the code for the exploit are available under this directory.

User `lucas` is a portal user and thus has no specific permission and thus has no permission to access the Inventory and Manufacturing modules. User `lucas` sends an XML-RPC to the `plm.config.settings` model through the External API, triggering the `GetUpdateTableData` method, passing a crafted `request` parameter that modifies the admin password through an injected SQL query.

`models.execute_kw(db, uid, password, 'plm.config.settings', 'GetUpdateTableData', [["ext_document", "2023-08-02'; UPDATE res_users SET password='whatever' WHERE login='admin'; SELECT password FROM res_users WHERE login='admin'; -- "]])`

Since the vulnerable method is a public method, it can be called from the External API. Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed with consequences ranging from information disclosure to data tampering and privilege escalation. A possible patch could make use of prepared statements or make the affected method private to be no longer callable from the External API.
