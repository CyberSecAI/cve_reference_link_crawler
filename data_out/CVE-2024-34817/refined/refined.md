- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions exposed within the plugin's functionality, but could include modifying settings, manipulating data, or performing other privileged operations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests and trick an authenticated user into triggering the crafted request. The attacker does not need any prior access to the WordPress site, but the user must be authenticated at the time the forged request is sent. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as the crafted request can be sent from an external website.
