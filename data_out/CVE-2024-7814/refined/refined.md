The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Railway Reservation System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application directly echoes user-supplied input into the HTML without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the `emp_fname`, `emp_lname`, `emp_nat_idno`, and `emp_addr` parameters on `/admin/admin-add-employee.php` and `/admin/admin-update-employee.php` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable pages.
- This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would submit a crafted payload through the vulnerable parameters.
- This payload is then stored in the database and rendered whenever the page is loaded by a user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add or update employee information through the admin interface.
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel or the ability to exploit an authentication bypass to access the vulnerable pages.
