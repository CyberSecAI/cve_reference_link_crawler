These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation during CLI command execution on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the rescue-user and executing vulnerable CLI commands using a malicious payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to *root* on an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndb-mprvesc-EMhDgXe5>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco Nexus Dashboard.  **Note:** For releases earlier than 2.0(1d), Cisco Nexus Dashboard was known as Cisco Application Services Engine.
