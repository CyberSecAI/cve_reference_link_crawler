Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Lack of Authentication on Plugin Upload:** The core issue is that the DataEase application does not properly authenticate users before allowing them to upload plugins. This lack of authorization allows any user, including those with standard privileges, to upload arbitrary plugin files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Plugin Upload Process:** The system lacks proper access control for the plugin upload functionality.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Malicious users can upload plugins containing arbitrary code.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** No restrictions on the type or content of the uploaded plugin files, enabling the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the DataEase application, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored or processed by DataEase.
*   **System Takeover:**  The attacker could potentially take control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Upload Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin upload functionality, which lacks authentication.
*   **Malicious Plugin:** The attacker crafts a malicious plugin file with embedded code to achieve command execution.
*   **Data Source Creation:** The attacker leverages a data source (Presto in this case) to trigger the execution of uploaded plugin's malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Account:** The attacker only requires a standard user account within the DataEase application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the DataEase application to interact with the plugin upload interface.
*   **Malicious Plugin Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious plugin file with embedded code.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to upload a malicious plugin and achieve arbitrary code execution due to missing authentication checks on the plugin upload feature. The vulnerability was patched in version v1.11.2.
