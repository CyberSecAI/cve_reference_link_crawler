    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted HTML attributes, leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts in a user's browser when they interact with the affected application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted user data (e.g. user-provided links in href attributes, or event attributes injected via splatting user-provided attributes)."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the HTML attributes rendered by the vulnerable application, either via user-provided links or by injecting malicious event attributes.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering HTML, specifically when handling `href` attributes and event attributes.  The fix includes case-insensitive checks for `javascript:` prefixes in `href` attributes, and a check to ensure attribute names do not contain unsafe characters or event attributes."
