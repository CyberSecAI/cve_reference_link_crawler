**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'reg-single-checkbox' shortcode of the ProfilePress plugin. Specifically, the `checkbox_text` attribute is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute in their browser. This can allow attackers to perform various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the 'reg-single-checkbox' shortcode, which allows for user-supplied attributes.
- The specific attack vector involves injecting malicious code into the `checkbox_text` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher are required to inject the malicious code.
- They need to be able to add the shortcode to pages on the WordPress site.
