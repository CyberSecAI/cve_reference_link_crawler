Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-26071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) as described by CWE-79.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, leading to stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a victim's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N).
- The attacker needs to inject malicious script into a vulnerable part of the application.
- Exploitation requires a user to interact with the injected script via a browser (UI:R).
- Exploitation occurs on a different part of the application compared to where the script is stored (S:C).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to store the payload in a persistent way, such that other users can access it later.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-26071 is a Stored XSS vulnerability in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). An attacker can store malicious JavaScript code within the application. When another user accesses the page containing the stored script, the malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session.
