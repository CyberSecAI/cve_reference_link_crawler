Package        : libjettison-java
Version        : 1.5.3-1~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-40150 CVE-2022-45685 CVE-2022-45693
Debian Bug     : 1022553

Several flaws have been discovered in libjettison-java, a
collection of StAX parsers and writers for JSON. Specially crafted user input
may cause a denial of service via out-of-memory or stack overflow errors.

In addition a build failure related to the update was fixed in jersey1.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.5.3-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libjettison-java packages.

| Dear Jettison maintainers,  Multiple bugs were found during fuzzing by [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer) in Jettison, for example [[Out of memory](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46549) and [Stackoverflow](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46538)]. We would like to provide you with access to the bugs at Google OSS-Fuzz before they get publicly disclosed.  What do we need from you?  We need an email address that is associated with a Google Account as per [Accepting new projects](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/accepting-new-projects/). In the past we have already contacted you during the onboarding of your project, but the request was rejected or no email was shared with us.  What do you get by sharing your email address?  When a bug is found, you will receive an email that will provide you with access to ClusterFuzz, crash reports, code coverage reports and fuzzer statistics. Each finding will have a crashing input that you can use to easily reproduce the bug.  Attention: All bug details will be made public automatically after the deadline of 90 days has exceeded or after the fix is released. For projects without maintainers we will do our best to support the disclosure process. Depending on our resources we will try to create an issues for every bug in your public issues tracker. In addition, we will request CVEs for security related vulnerabilities.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding fuzzing or the OSS-Fuzz integration.  Thank you for your reading and hope to hear from you soon! |

| Dear Jettison maintainers,  this is a friendly reminder, are you guys interested in onboarding to the OSS-Fuzz platform?  If we can not get maintainers from your project we will do our best to disclose issues to the community, and also request CVEs for security related vulnerabilities.  Thank you and hope to hear from you soon! |

| Dear [@coheigea](https://github.com/coheigea), I was on a long vacation and just had time now to check recently. I verified with jettison's master branch and it looks like this issue is fixed. I will request to update the fixed version field for [CVE-2022-40149](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56h3-78gp-v83r "CVE-2022-40149") and [CVE-2022-40150](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x27m-9w8j-5vcw "CVE-2022-40150").

([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.5.2

## Patched versions

1.5.2

## Description

Those using Jettison to parse untrusted XML or JSON data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by Out of memory. This effect may support a denial of service attack.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
