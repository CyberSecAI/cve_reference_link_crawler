| Dear Jettison maintainers,  Multiple bugs were found during fuzzing by [Jazzer](https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer) in Jettison, for example [[Out of memory](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46549) and [Stackoverflow](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46538)]. We would like to provide you with access to the bugs at Google OSS-Fuzz before they get publicly disclosed.  What do we need from you?  We need an email address that is associated with a Google Account as per [Accepting new projects](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/accepting-new-projects/). In the past we have already contacted you during the onboarding of your project, but the request was rejected or no email was shared with us.  What do you get by sharing your email address?  When a bug is found, you will receive an email that will provide you with access to ClusterFuzz, crash reports, code coverage reports and fuzzer statistics. Each finding will have a crashing input that you can use to easily reproduce the bug.  Attention: All bug details will be made public automatically after the deadline of 90 days has exceeded or after the fix is released. For projects without maintainers we will do our best to support the disclosure process. Depending on our resources we will try to create an issues for every bug in your public issues tracker. In addition, we will request CVEs for security related vulnerabilities.  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding fuzzing or the OSS-Fuzz integration.  Thank you for your reading and hope to hear from you soon! |

| Dear Jettison maintainers,  this is a friendly reminder, are you guys interested in onboarding to the OSS-Fuzz platform?  If we can not get maintainers from your project we will do our best to disclose issues to the community, and also request CVEs for security related vulnerabilities.  Thank you and hope to hear from you soon! |

| Hello [@coheigea](https://github.com/coheigea) ,  The Stackoverflow issue [CVE-2022-40149](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56h3-78gp-v83r "CVE-2022-40149") has been fixed by Jettison 1.5.1. But the Out of Memory issue [CVE-2022-40150](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x27m-9w8j-5vcw "CVE-2022-40150") is still not fixed with the newest release of Jettison.  If you would like to have the reproducer for the out of memory issue please let me know, thanks. |

| Dear [@coheigea](https://github.com/coheigea), I was on a long vacation and just had time now to check recently. I verified with jettison's master branch and it looks like this issue is fixed. I will request to update the fixed version field for [CVE-2022-40149](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56h3-78gp-v83r "CVE-2022-40149") and [CVE-2022-40150](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x27m-9w8j-5vcw "CVE-2022-40150"). Thank you for the quick fixes and feedback! |
