- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation on email links allows users to inject custom field values into `mailto` links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary data into mailto links. This is related to CWE-20, which covers improper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious content within the mailto links, though the specific impact (other than potentially misleading or annoying users) is not fully detailed here. The impact is rated as low, with only low impact to confidentiality and no impact to integrity or availability, suggesting the practical impact is minimal.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can be remote to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L).
    - User interaction is required (UI:R) for exploitation.
    - Attack complexity is high (AC:H), possibly indicating the need for crafted input or specific user actions.
