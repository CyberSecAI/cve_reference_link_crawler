| I'm not too optimistic given that the readme states that libsass is now deprecated. Similar story I guess for [#3178](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/3178) & [#3174](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/3174) which are very similar bugs. |

| I was looking into fixing this issue but since both the code is new to me and I don't know too much about sass it is not so easy :)  The above provided backtrace isn't much helpful either since it only shows the recursive calling of `has_real_parent_ref()`.  When running the POC, which is `+{:not(&){_:(&)}_:0}`, I see:  ``` #0  0x00007ffff7c73ba0 in Sass::ComplexSelector::has_real_parent_ref() const@plt () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #1  0x00007ffff7d5f33a in Sass::Parser::parseComplexSelector(bool) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #2  0x00007ffff7d5f957 in Sass::Parser::parseSelectorList(bool) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #3  0x00007ffff7d36213 in Sass::Parser::parse_ruleset(Lookahead) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #4  0x00007ffff7d2f81e in Sass::Parser::parse_block_node(bool) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #5  0x00007ffff7d30215 in Sass::Parser::parse_block_nodes(bool) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #6  0x00007ffff7d30807 in Sass::Parser::parse() () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1 #7  0x00007ffff7ceebe1 in Sass::Context::register_resource(Sass::Include const&, Sass::Resource const&) () from /lib64/libsass-3.6.5.so.1  ```  So I looked into the mentioned functions, specifically `parse_ruleset()` and `parseSelectorList()` but knowing so little about the code it is hard to find the cause.  I'm not too optimistic given that the readme states that libsass is now deprecated.  The readme also states `While it will continue to receive maintenance releases indefinitely, there are no plans to add additional features or compatibility with any new CSS or Sass features`. I believe CVEs fall into the maintenance category :)  [@mgreter](https://github.com/mgreter) [@xzyfer](https://github.com/xzyfer) : Does one of you maybe have some spare time to help us figure this out? That would be great! 🙏 |

| I may have a fix at <https://github.com/mgreter/libsass/tree/bugfix/x-mas-2023> (please test it), but that may be the last fix I will do for LibSass. As I never was part or had any say in the development of Sass, and also no longer working in fronted, this is merely a bugfix out of good will. You will need to move to dart sass, as that is the future, as the people involved in Sass put it. PR: [#3184](https://github.com/sass/libsass/pull/3184) |

This CVE is fixed in current libsass recipe version.
So wrapper around it will also not show this problem.
It's usual usecase is to be statically linked with libsass which is
probably the reason why this is listed as vulnerable component.

[1] links [2] as issue tracker which points to [3] as fix.
[4] as base repository for the recipe is not involved and files from [3]
    are not present in this repository.
