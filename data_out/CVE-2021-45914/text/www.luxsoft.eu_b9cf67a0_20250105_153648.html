##### Download LuxCal Calendar

LuxCal can be downloaded on various freeware web sites. On this page however,
you can always download the latest LuxCal calendar versions.

The LuxCal calendar is available in two flavours:

* LuxCal - MySQL, using a MySQL database of your ISP. Before installing the
  LuxCal calendar you will need to set up this database, with tools provided by
  your ISP.
* LuxCal - SQLite, using an SQLite database, which is an extension of the PHP
  installation on your server. No setting up and no database knowledge is
  required. (recommended!)

### !! THIS NEW LUXCAL VERSION REQUIRES PHP 7 OR UP !!

Both versions have exactly the same functionality.
