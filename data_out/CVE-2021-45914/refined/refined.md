Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the LuxCal Web Calendar's failure to properly validate or sanitize user input within a POST request and/or cookie value. This allows an attacker to manipulate these values and bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass: The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism of the LuxCal application.
- Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker without any prior authentication.
- Vulnerable versions: Versions of LuxCal Web Calendar prior to 5.20 are affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full compromise: An attacker can authenticate as any registered user, including the administrator, gaining complete access to the application's functionality and data.
- Data manipulation: With administrative access, the attacker could alter, delete, or add calendar events and modify application settings.
- Confidentiality breach: The attacker could access sensitive information stored within the calendar application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious POST request: An attacker can craft a malicious POST request, manipulating specific parameters to impersonate another user.
- Malicious cookie value: An attacker can manipulate the cookie values to achieve the same authentication bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LuxCal web calendar.
- No authentication required: The attacker does not require any pre-existing user credentials.
- Technical skills: The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests (POST) and/or how to manipulate cookies.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during research for a Synack Red Team client.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
- The vulnerability was fixed in LuxCal version 5.2.0.
- The vendor was responsive and collaborated with the researcher to patch the issue.
