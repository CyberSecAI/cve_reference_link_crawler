## CVE-2024-26367

### Summary

A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web interface of multiple Evertz microsystems products such as MViP-II, XPS-EDGE-\*, evEDGE-EO-\*, MMA10G-\*, 570IPG-X19-10G, allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a clients browser via a crafted payload in the login parameters.

### Versions Impacted

The Evertz Microsystems products affected are :

| Product | Versions Tested |
| --- | --- |
| MViP-II | Firmware 8.6.5 |
| XPS-EDGE-\* | Build 1467 |
| evEDGE-EO-\* | Build 0029 |
| MMA10G-\* | Build 0498 |
| 570IPG-X19-10G | Build 0691 |

### Vulnerability Details

This vulnerability can be exploited when a user of these systems accesses the web interface for these devices using a link crafted by an attacker, which contains malicious HTML encoded in the `location` parameter of `/login.php`

As an example, the following HTML payload can be embedded in this parameter concerned :

```
http://localhost"><script>alert(document.domain)</script> <div id ="a

```

Such malicious HTML can be embedded in the parameter concerned :

```
/login.php?location=aHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdCI+PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4pPC9zY3JpcHQ+IDxkaXYgaWQgPSJh

```

This should generate a basic alert with the domain of the endpoint :
![5D20A4A2-18A8-4A40-877A-EADDD76A56D6](https://github.com/notnotnotveg/notnotnotveg.github.io/assets/65092714/4b3358bd-a64e-4a0d-af35-dd89390a581b)

### Recommended Mitigations

Multiple attempts (direct contact and by CERT/CC) have been made to responsibly disclose the issue to the Evertz Microsystems to address the root cause of this vulnerability, but no response was received.

Users are advised to restrict network access to their deployments and inspect URLs for their panels before clicking them.
