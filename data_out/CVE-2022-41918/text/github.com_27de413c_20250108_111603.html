# Issue with fine-grained access control of indices backing data streams

Moderate

[CEHENKLE](/CEHENKLE)
published
GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg
Nov 15, 2022

## Package

docker

OpenSearch
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<1.3.7; <2.4.0

## Patched versions

>=1.3.7; >=2.4.0

maven

org.opensearch.plugin:opensearch-security
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

<1.3.7; <2.4.0

>=1.3.7; >=2.4.0

## Description

### Impact

There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. This issue can only be triggered by authenticated users authorized to read those data streams which are backed by the impacted indexes. Additionally, existing privileged users cannot access random indexes within these clusters; they can only access indexes to which they have already been granted permission.

### Patches

OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue.

### Workarounds

There is no recommended work around.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (<https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/>) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
