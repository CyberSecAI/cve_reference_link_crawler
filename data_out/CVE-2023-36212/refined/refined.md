Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input validation or sanitization in the file upload functionality of Total CMS 1.7.4. Specifically, the application does not prevent the upload of arbitrary PHP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CMS allows authenticated users to upload files without properly checking the file type or content, leading to the ability to upload a malicious PHP file.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server by accessing the uploaded PHP file with the malicious code.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This vulnerability can lead to a full system compromise if the attacker escalates privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the web interface of the Total CMS by uploading the malicious file through the "downloads area" in the "Edit Page" section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Total CMS.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Total CMS instance.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit involves the following steps:

1.  Login to the vulnerable Total CMS as an authenticated user.
2.  Navigate to the "Edit Page" section of the CMS.
3.  Locate the "downloads area" on the page.
4.  Upload a PHP file (named `shell.php` in the provided exploit) with the following code:

```php
<?php
echo "<pre>";
system($_REQUEST['cmd']);
echo "</pre>";
?>
```

5. Access the uploaded shell via a web browser, adding a `cmd` parameter to the URL to execute commands, such as:
    `https://<target>/cms-data/depot/cmssoccerdepot/shell.php?cmd=id`

The exploit code provided on GitHub is written in Python and automates these steps, using the `requests` library to interact with the vulnerable CMS.
