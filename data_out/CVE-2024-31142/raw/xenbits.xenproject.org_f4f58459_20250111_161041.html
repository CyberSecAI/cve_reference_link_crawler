             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2024-31142 / XSA-455
                                version 4

	     x86: Incorrect logic for BTC/SRSO mitigations

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

Correct references to prior XSAs.  The XSA fixing Branch Type Confusion
was XSA-407, not XSA-422 as previously stated.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Because of a logical error in XSA-407 (Branch Type Confusion), the
mitigation is not applied properly when it is intended to be used.
XSA-434 (Speculative Return Stack Overflow) uses the same
infrastructure, so is equally impacted.

For more details, see:
  <a href="https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-407.html">https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-407.html</a>
  <a href="https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-434.html">https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-434.html</a>

IMPACT
======

XSAs 407 and 434 are unmitigated, even when the patches are in place.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen containing the XSA-407 fixes are vulnerable.

See XSAs 407 and 434 for details on which hardware is susceptible to
BTC/SRSO.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of XenServer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that the Xen Security Team is intending to produce releases on all
stable trees, on the public embargo.  Therefore, this fix is expected to
be contained in the following release tags:

  RELEASE-4.18.2
  RELEASE-4.17.4
  RELEASE-4.16.6
  RELEASE-4.15.6

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.
