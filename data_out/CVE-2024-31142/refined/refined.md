- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logical error in the mitigation for Branch Type Confusion (BTC) introduced in XSA-407, which is also used by the Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO) mitigation from XSA-434.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The BTC/SRSO mitigations are not properly applied due to the logical error. This effectively leaves systems vulnerable to these speculative execution attacks, despite having the initial patches applied.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Systems remain vulnerable to Branch Type Confusion and Speculative Return Stack Overflow vulnerabilities, even with prior mitigations in place. This could allow an attacker to perform speculative execution attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are the same as those for the original BTC (XSA-407) and SRSO (XSA-434) vulnerabilities. The advisory does not provide specifics but refers to the original advisory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The advisory refers to the original BTC and SRSO vulnerabilities for details on attacker capabilities.
