{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `undici` library's fetch implementation did not clear `Cookie` headers on cross-origin redirects, even though it cleared `Authorization` headers. This deviates from the intended behavior according to the Fetch specification where `Cookie` headers are considered forbidden request headers and should not be sent in cross-origin requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper handling of cookie headers during cross-origin redirects",
    "Violation of the Fetch specification regarding forbidden request headers"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site, potentially exposing sensitive information or session data. A malicious attacker controlling the redirection target (e.g. open redirector) could also leverage this to leak the cookie to a 3rd-party site.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network redirects to a different origin than the initial request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the redirection target to receive the leaked cookie. An open redirector can be used for this."
