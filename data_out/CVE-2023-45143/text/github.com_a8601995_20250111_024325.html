# Cookie header not cleared on cross-origin redirect in fetch

Low

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-wqq4-5wpv-mx2g
Oct 12, 2023

## Package

npm

undici
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 5.26.2

## Patched versions

>= v5.26.2

## Description

### Impact

Undici already cleared Authorization headers on cross-origin redirects, but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design, `cookie` headers are [forbidden request headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-request-header), disallowing them to be set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of fetch.

As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the 3rd party site.

### Patches

This was patched in [e041de359221ebeae04c469e8aff4145764e6d76](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/commit/e041de359221ebeae04c469e8aff4145764e6d76).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
