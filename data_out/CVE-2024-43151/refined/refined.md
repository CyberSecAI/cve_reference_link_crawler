**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The plugin `Ultimate Addons for Beaver Builder â€“ Lite` version 1.5.9 and earlier is vulnerable to XSS, likely due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within the plugin's code.

**Weaknesses:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website.
- These scripts can execute when guests visit the site.
- The injected scripts can be used for redirects, displaying advertisements, or other malicious activities using HTML payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The specific injection point is not mentioned in this content, but it would involve a location where the plugin processes user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to inject scripts into the website. The content specifies that a user with "Contributor" role privilege could be able to do this, which suggests a potential lack of sanitization/validation during processing of contributed content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.5.10.
- The vulnerability is categorized as an "Injection" under OWASP Top 10 (A3), which is a broad category, and then more specifically categorized as Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
