For those who haven't prepared/shipped updates yet: we've got a fix for
a stack-based buffer overflow in nscd under review.

  [PATCH 0/4] Various nscd security fixes
  <[https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/cover.1713974801.git.fweimer@redhat.com/](https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/cover.1713974801.git.fweimer%40redhat.com/)>

These are initial patches, still under review.  The glibc security team
will send a separate notification once official patches are ready.

The initial issue was reported in Bugzilla without an embargo period,
hence the public patch development.  The other bugs concern the same
code and are very minor compared to the initial finding, so a separate
embargo for them doesn't make sense.

Thanks,
Florian
