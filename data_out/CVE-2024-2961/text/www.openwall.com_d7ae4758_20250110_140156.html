Oh, right:

| Obviously, base64-encoding is not the only thing you can do. Many
| filters are available.
| […]
|
|  » convert.iconv.X.Y, which converts charset from X to Y
|
| Let's take a look at the last filter: convert.iconv.X.Y. Say that I need
| to convert my file from UTF8 to UTF16. I can use:
|
|   php://filter/convert.iconv.UTF-8.UTF-16/resource=/etc/passwd

Unfortunately, that exposes all installed iconv converters in all
directions (unlike glibc's ,ccs= parameter for fopen), once there is an
arbitrary URL read injection vulnerability in a PHP application.

Thanks,
Florian
