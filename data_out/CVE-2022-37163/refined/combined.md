| Hello üëã  I run a security community that finds and fixes vulnerabilities in OSS. A researcher ([@J-GainSec](https://github.com/J-GainSec)) has found a potential issue, which I would be eager to share with you.  Could you add a `SECURITY.md` file with an e-mail address for me to send further details to? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) a security policy to ensure issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would help direct researchers in the future.  Looking forward to hearing from you üëç  (cc [@huntr-helper](https://github.com/huntr-helper)) |

| 1. I haven't used/worked on this project for months. 2. I didn't get in touch with OP.   I no longer wish to maintain IHTB, see [#26](https://github.com/lebriton/ihatetobudget/issues/26). |

# CVE-2022-37857, CVE-2022-37163, CVE-2022-37164 Hardcoded Credentials/Weak Password Policies

[gainsec](https://gainsec.com/author/gainsec/ "Posts by gainsec")
[Android Hacking](https://gainsec.com/category/android-hacking/), [CVE](https://gainsec.com/category/cve/), [Hacking Android](https://gainsec.com/category/hacking-android/), [Mobile Penetration Testing](https://gainsec.com/category/penetration-testing/mobile-penetration-testing/), [Pentesting Android](https://gainsec.com/category/pentesting-android/)
August 7, 2022August 26, 2022

* [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857)
* Affected product and version: Hauk version 1.6.1
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and hardcoded credentials
* Description: Hauk¬†v1.6.1 requires a hardcoded password which by default is blank. This hardcoded password is hashed but stored within the config.php file server-side as well as in clear-text on the android client device by default.

* [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)
* Affected Product and version: IHateToBudget version 1.5.7
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

* [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)
* Affected product and version: OnTrack version 3.4
* Problem Type: Weak Password Policy and Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
* Description: OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.

So I ran into an interesting issue with a self-hosted location sharing service that includes a android client available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.varden.hauk/) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.varden.hauk&hl=en&gl=US).

I reached out to the developer talking about the Janus vulnerability although I think that his response was totally legitimate. Which you can read about [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/issues/187).

If you‚Äôre interested in the Janus vulnerability, check more information about it [HERE](https://medium.com/mobis3c/exploiting-apps-vulnerable-to-janus-cve-2017-13156-8d52c983b4e0)!

Regardless what I decided to pursue and report was the fact that credentials are hardcoded [HERE](https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk/blob/master/backend-php/include/config-sample.php#L73), although of course you need to replace config-sample.php to config.php.

So the developer was professional and didn‚Äôt have real push back but their choice was to leave the password requirements/hardcoded credential requirement to the administrator.

Even though I completely understand it, I wanted to let those that rely on this server/client know.

That is where [CVE-2022-37857](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37857) comes from!

Following that path, the OnTrack application found [HERE](https://github.com/inoda/ontrack) was also vulnerable and assigned [CVE-2022-37164](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37164)

Lastly the same issue was found in the [IHateToBudget](https://github.com/bminusl/ihatetobudget) application found HERE and was assigned [CVE-2022-37163](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37163)

Hope its helpful!
