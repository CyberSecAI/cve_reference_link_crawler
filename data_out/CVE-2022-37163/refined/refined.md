Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the application's weak password policy and insufficient password hashing practices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Password Policy:** The application allows for easy brute-force attacks, suggesting a lack of complexity requirements for user passwords (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
*   **Insufficient Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed without using a salt or pepper. This makes it significantly easier for attackers to crack the password hashes using tools like Hashcat.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access to the application. This means attackers could potentially gain control over user accounts and access their data/resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Brute-force attacks:** The weak password policy makes it possible to guess user passwords through automated attacks.
*   **Password hash cracking:** The lack of salt and pepper in the hashing process allows attackers to crack password hashes offline using readily available tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the login system of the application (either on a server or client app).
*   The attacker requires access to the password hashes (e.g., database, compromised application).
*   The attacker would need the ability to perform brute force or password hash cracking, which usually requires some technical skills and specialized tools.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content states that the affected product is `IHateToBudget version 1.5.7`
*   The content suggests the researcher also found a similar issue in other applications (Hauk, OnTrack) but those are separate CVEs.
