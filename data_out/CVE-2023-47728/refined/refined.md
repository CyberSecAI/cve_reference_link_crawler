Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the exposure of information through a detailed technical error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The system inadvertently reveals sensitive technical details within error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is information exposure. While the specific details are not outlined, detailed technical error messages can potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's configuration, internal workings, or other data that could be used for further attacks or compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but it involves a user or attacker triggering an error condition that results in the display of the detailed error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected application in a way that causes it to generate the detailed error message. This might involve probing the system with invalid input or by exploiting an edge case that triggers the problematic error output. The specific capabilities needed are not discussed in the document, but access to the affected application is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Cloud Pak for Security versions 1.10.0.0 to 1.10.11.0 and QRadar Suite Software versions 1.10.12.0 to 1.10.22.0.
*   IBM recommends upgrading to version 1.10.23.0 or later to remediate the issue.
*   No workarounds are available.
