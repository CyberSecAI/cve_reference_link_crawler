Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5669

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing authorization check within the `ffw_activate_template` function in the "XPlainer â€“ WooCommerce Product FAQ" WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for activating templates for the FAQ display.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper capability checks before allowing users to execute the `ffw_activate_template` function. This means that any authenticated user, even those with minimal privileges (Subscriber role or higher), can trigger this function.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the missing authorization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the template activation process. This malicious script is then stored within the plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected XSS payload is executed whenever a user accesses the dashboard templates or views FAQs.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not directly stated, a successful XSS attack could be used to escalate privileges or perform actions on behalf of an administrator.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could potentially modify plugin settings or inject content into other parts of the website, depending on the capabilities of the stored XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with at least Subscriber-level privileges or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site.
*   **Subscriber or Higher Role:** The account must have at least subscriber level access to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable `ffw_activate_template` function, and how to invoke it through an AJAX request, though this is not explicitly stated in the provided content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.7.0.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.1.
* The vulnerable function `ffw_activate_template` is present within the file `faq-woocommerce-admin-functions.php`.
* The file `faq-woocommerce-admin-functions.php` contains other functions that also do not have any capability checks. It is not stated if these are also vulnerable.
