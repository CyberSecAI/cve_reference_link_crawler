Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper initialization of memory before it's accessed during the parsing of J2K files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uninitialized Variable: The core issue is that memory used in the parsing of J2K files is not properly initialized. This results in the program using whatever data happens to be in that memory, which could include sensitive information.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability leads to information disclosure because uninitialized memory can contain data from previous operations or from the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Exposure: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data that resides in the uninitialized memory.
- Arbitrary Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities): While this vulnerability itself is primarily about information disclosure, the advisory mentions that an attacker could combine this with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can craft a malicious J2K file that, when parsed by the vulnerable PDF-XChange Editor, triggers the uninitialized variable issue.
- Malicious Page:  The user could visit a malicious page that contains a J2K file which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: Exploiting this vulnerability requires user interaction. The target user needs to open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page.
- No special privileges required: The attacker does not need any elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the J2K file parsing module of the software.
-  The vendor has released an update to address this vulnerability.
