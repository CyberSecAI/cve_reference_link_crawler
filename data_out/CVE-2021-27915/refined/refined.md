- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  XSS vulnerability in the description fields within the Mautic application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A logged-in Mautic user with appropriate permissions could inject malicious scripts into the description fields, leading to potential elevated access to the system. This could enable the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via crafted input in the description fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A logged-in Mautic user with the ability to modify description fields. Low privileges are required to exploit. User interaction is also required.
