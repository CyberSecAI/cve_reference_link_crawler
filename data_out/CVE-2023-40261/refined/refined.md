  "CVE-2023-40261": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) protections by removing execute permissions from the IMA initialization script, allowing the execution of unsigned binaries.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Failure to validate file attributes during PBA Phase I integrity checks, allowing modification of execute permissions without triggering integrity errors.",
      "Inadequate enforcement of IMA security controls, allowing the execution of unsigned binaries by disabling the IMA initialization script."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve code execution within the Linux environment, enabling them to compromise the ATM system, recover disk encryption keys, and decrypt the Windows operating system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Physical access to the ATM's hard drive.",
        "Modifying the execute permissions of the IMA initialization script ( /etc/rc.d/init.d/ima ) on the unencrypted Linux partition (P5).",
        "Replacing legitimate system binaries with malicious code."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires physical access to the ATM's hard drive to modify the contents of the Linux partition. The attacker must also have the ability to mount and modify the file system."
