Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a combination of Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaws in Confluence Data Center and Server. The specific location or mechanism of the flaw is not provided, but it is stated to have been introduced in version 4.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects attacker-controlled input in the response without proper sanitization, which allows the execution of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **CSRF:**  The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
*   An attacker can force an authenticated user to execute unwanted actions on the Confluence web application.
*   This has a high impact on confidentiality (ability to access sensitive information) and low impact on integrity (potential to modify data or settings), and no impact to availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload.
*   The attacker uses a CSRF attack to force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on a malicious link (in the case of reflected XSS) or visit a malicious site (in the case of a CSRF attack).
*   User interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1 and is classified as High severity.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through Atlassian's Bug Bounty program.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.3 of Confluence.
