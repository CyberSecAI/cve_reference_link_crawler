Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-51699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when constructing OS commands in the Fluid project's JuicefsRuntime. Specifically, the `mount.Name`, `juiceSubPath`, `value.Fuse.MountPath`, `value.Worker.MountPath`, `value.Configs.Storage`, `value.Configs.Bucket`, and `value.Fuse.SubPath` are directly incorporated into command strings without escaping special characters. This allows for OS command injection through crafted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is that unsanitized user-controlled data is used to build shell commands. This lets an attacker execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system by injecting malicious code into these parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands within the context of the juicefs-related containers.
- **Unauthorized Access, Modification, or Deletion of Data:** This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or deletion of critical files.
- **Compromise of the system:** The attacker could potentially use the initial command execution as a stepping stone to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The attacker needs the ability to create or update K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with high privileges (PR:H) in the Kubernetes environment.
- **Ability to Create/Update CRDs:** The attacker must have the ability to create or update the K8s CRD Dataset/JuicefsRuntime.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user interaction is marked as required(UI:R). However, it is not clear what kind of interaction is required. It could be simply creating or modifying the CRDs.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix implemented involves sanitizing user-provided strings using the `security.EscapeBashStr` function before constructing OS commands. This function escapes characters that have special meanings in the shell, preventing command injection.
- The fix also removes the usage of `bash -c` when executing the `df` command and `sed` commands which can be also vulnerable.
- The version `0.9.3` and above is not vulnerable.

**CVSS Score:**
- **CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**
   - **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)
   - **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
   - **Privileges Required (PR):** High (H)
   - **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)
   - **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
   - **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)
   - **Integrity (I):** None (N)
   - **Availability (A):** None (N)

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit diffs show the changes made to address the vulnerability. These include:
- Introducing `security.EscapeBashStr` to sanitize strings before using them in shell commands
- Applying `security.EscapeBashStr` in various locations of `pkg/ddc/juicefs/operations/base.go` and `pkg/ddc/juicefs/transform_fuse.go` where user input was being used without escaping.
- Adding a new file `pkg/utils/security/escape.go` with the implementation for `EscapeBashStr`.
- Adding a unit test `pkg/utils/security/escape_test.go` to test the function `EscapeBashStr`.
- Fixing the `GetUsedSpace` method to avoid using `bash -c`
