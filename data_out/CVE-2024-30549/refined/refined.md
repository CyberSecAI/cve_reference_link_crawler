- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Contact Forms by Cimatti plugin, versions 1.8.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS, which allows malicious actors to inject harmful scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts could redirect users, display unwanted advertisements, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's contact form functionality. Specific details on the injection point are not provided, but it would likely involve user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require the ability to submit data to the contact form. To successfully inject the malicious script, some level of understanding of how the application handles form data may be required. An administrator privilege is mentioned, however, it seems that this is the privilege of the affected user, not the attacker.
