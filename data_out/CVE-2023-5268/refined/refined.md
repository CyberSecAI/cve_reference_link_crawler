Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/src/admin/makehtml_taglist_action.php` file of DedeBIZ V6.2. The `mktime` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`mktime` parameter) before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control of the server hosting the database.
- The provided example demonstrates that the attacker can determine the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the `mktime` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication (Backend):** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable `/admin/makehtml_taglist_action.php` page.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker demonstrates exploitation using both error-based and time-based SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker used `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation, indicating the vulnerability is easily exploitable using common tools.
- Example payload is provided.
- The vulnerability is present in DedeBIZ V6.2.
