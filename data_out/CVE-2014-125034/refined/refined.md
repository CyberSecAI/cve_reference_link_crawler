Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The code was vulnerable to XSS because user-provided variables were not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page. Specifically, the `var_check` function in `libs/View.php` was previously returning unsanitized variables.

**Weakness:** Lack of output encoding/escaping. The original code directly outputted the variable, allowing HTML or JavaScript code within the variable to be interpreted by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various security issues such as:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vector:**  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code in a variable that is processed by the `var_check` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to influence the data used as variables by the application. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
   - Submitting data through a form.
   - Modifying request parameters.
   - If the application stores data and presents it back to users.

**Mitigation:** The commit mitigates the XSS vulnerability by using `htmlspecialchars()` in the `var_check` function. This function converts special characters into HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code.
   - The `ENT_QUOTES` argument ensures that both single and double quotes are encoded.
   - The 'UTF-8' argument sets the correct character encoding.

**Additional Notes:** The commit message "I put htmlspecialchars() into the var_check to avoid the XSS injection." clearly states the intention and fixes the issue.
