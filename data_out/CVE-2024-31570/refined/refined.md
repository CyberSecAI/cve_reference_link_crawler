**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted XPM image file is loaded using the `FreeImage_Load` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious XPM file to a system using the vulnerable FreeImage library. This could be done through various means, such as:
    *   A website allowing users to upload images.
    *   An application that processes images.
    *   Sending the malicious image to a user.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is located in `PluginXPM.cpp` within the `Load()` function.
*   The vulnerable library version is identified as 3.19.0 (r1909).
*   The vulnerability was originally discovered by Ruanxingzhi, who reported it as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities that were assigned CVEs in the range CVE-2024-28562 to CVE-2024-28584.
