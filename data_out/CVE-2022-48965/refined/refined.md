```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A reference count leak exists in the `rockchip_gpiolib_register` function within the Rockchip GPIO driver. The `of_get_parent()` function increments the reference count of the device tree node, but the corresponding `of_node_put()` call to decrement the reference count was missing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reference counting error",
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeated calls to `rockchip_gpiolib_register` without freeing the allocated resources may lead to memory exhaustion over time. This can potentially lead to denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the initialization of the rockchip gpio driver. This usually happens during device boot or driver reloading. Exploitation would require a method to repeatedly trigger this function, which typically happens via the driver loading.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the capability to trigger the driver loading or reloading mechanism repeatedly."
  }
