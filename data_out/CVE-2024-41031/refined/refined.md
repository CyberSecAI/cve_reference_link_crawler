The provided content describes a bug fix in the Linux kernel related to PMD-sized page cache allocation when using transparent huge pages (THP) on ARM64 architecture, and does not describe a vulnerability. Specifically, the issue arises when the PMD-sized page cache is larger than `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER` due to the value of `HPAGE_PMD_ORDER` being 13 when the base page size is 64KB. This situation leads to a failure in `xarray`'s split allocation routine.

The fix prevents the allocation of PMD-sized page cache in this scenario, causing the system to fall back to a regular readahead path that is configured by the BDI's `read_ahead_kb` sysfs file.

The provided content shows three different commits addressing the same issue:
- commit `1ef650d3b1b2a16473981b447f38705fe9b93972`
- commit `3390916aca7af1893ed2ebcdfee1d6fdb65bb058`
- commit `06b5a69c27ec405a3c3f2da8520ff1ee70b94a21`

These commits all contain the same patch and the same explanation, with the only difference being the parent commit.
The relevant code change in `mm/filemap.c` introduces a check to ensure that PMD-sized page cache allocation is skipped if `HPAGE_PMD_ORDER` is larger than `MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER`.

 		ra->size = HPAGE_PMD_NR;
```
The root cause of the issue is that the PMD-sized page cache allocation logic was not handling the case where the size exceeds the maximum supported order of the page cache.

This issue would result in a kernel warning and a crash, thus impacting system stability.

This does not describe a security vulnerability, but rather a functional issue that could cause system instability. Therefore it is **UNRELATED** to a CVE.
