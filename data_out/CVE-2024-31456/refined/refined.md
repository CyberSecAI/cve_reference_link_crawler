Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is an SQL injection in the map search functionality of GLPI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `ajax/map.php` when processing POST parameters for `itemtype` and `params`. These parameters are passed to `Search::prepareDatasForSearch` and `Search::constructSQL`, which are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Impact:** High, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Integrity Impact:** None reported
- **Availability Impact:** None reported
- The attacker can manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the GLPI system.
- **Low Privileges Required**: The attacker needs only low level privileges

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is only exploitable on GLPI servers using PHP 7.4.
- The fix involves an upgrade to GLPI version 10.0.15.
- A workaround is upgrading to PHP 8.0 or higher, since the issue is not exploitable on PHP 8.0+
- The vulnerable code is located in `ajax/map.php` and `src/Search.php`. The fix includes a modification of the `cleanParams` function in `src/Search.php` to sanitize input.
- The commit `730c3db29a1edc32f9b9d1e2a940e90a0211ab26` contains the fix.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')).
