| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense Software Remote Access VPN Brute Force Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asaftd-bf-dos-vDZhLqrW  First Published: 2024 October 23 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwj45822](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj45822)  [CSCwj91570](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj91570)     CVE-2024-20481     CWE-772       CVSS Score: [Base 5.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20481     CWE-772       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-bf-dos-vDZhLqrW/csaf/cisco-sa-asaftd-bf-dos-vDZhLqrW.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN (RAVPN) service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the RAVPN service.  This vulnerability is due to resource exhaustion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of VPN authentication requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources, resulting in a DoS of the RAVPN service on the affected device. Depending on the impact of the attack, a reload of the device may be required to restore the RAVPN service. Services that are not related to VPN are not affected.  Cisco Talos discussed these attacks in the blog post [Large-scale brute-force activity targeting VPNs, SSH services with commonly used login credentials](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/large-scale-brute-force-activity-targeting-vpns-ssh-services-with-commonly-used-login-credentials/).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-bf-dos-vDZhLqrW>  This advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA or FTD Software and had the RAVPN service enabled.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the SSL VPN Configuration**  To determine whether SSL VPN is enabled, use the **show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable** command on the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable** command on a device that has SSL VPN enabled on the outside interface:  ```   firewall# show running-config webvpn | include ^ enable enable outside   ```  If there is no output for the command, the SSL VPN is not enabled on any interface and the device is not affected by this vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software   + Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software  Indicators of Compromise  * When a device is experiencing a password spray attack, there are several potential indicators.  The most prevalent indicator is specific log messages that occur frequently and in large quantities. The following are examples of the types of log messages that may appear during a password spray attack. Which message is present depends on the device configuration, so it is not necessary for all message types to be present to indicate a password spray attack.  ```   %ASA-6-113005: AAA user authentication Rejected : reason = Unspecified : server = 10.1.2.3 : user = admin : user IP = 192.168.1.2%ASA-6-113015: AAA user authentication Rejected : reason = User was not found : local database : user = admin : user IP = 192.168.1.2%ASA-6-716039: Group <DfltGrpPolicy> User <admin> IP <192.168.1.2> Authentication: rejected, Session Type: WebVPN.   ```  **Note:** Depending on the device configuration, username fields may include **\*** characters to hide the username.  Another method for detecting a password spray attack is to monitor the volume of authentication requests and authentication rejects. To do this, use the **show aaa-server** command on the CLI multiple times, with several seconds between each use of the command. A large number of authentication rejects could indicate an ongoing attack. The following output of the **show aaa-server** command shows that the numbers of authentication requests and authentication rejects increased between uses of the command:  ```   Firewall# show aaa-serverServer Group: LDAP-SERVERServer Protocol: ldapServer Hostname: ldap-server.example.comServer Address: 10.1.2.3Server port: 636Server status: ACTIVE, Last transaction at unknownNumber of pending requests 0Average round trip time 0msNumber of authentication requests 2220000 Number of authorization requests 0Number of accounting requests 0Number of retransmissions 0Number of accepts 1312Number of rejects 2212345Number of challenges 0Number of malformed responses 0Number of bad authenticators 0Number of timeouts 1Number of unrecognized responses 0Firewall#.Wait some amount of time.Firewall# show aaa-serverServer Group: LDAP-SERVERServer Protocol: ldapServer Hostname: ldap-server.example.comServer Address: 10.1.2.3Server port: 636Server status: ACTIVE, Last transaction at unknownNumber of pending requests 0Average round trip time 0msNumber of authentication requests 2234567Number of authorization requests 0Number of accounting requests 0Number of retransmissions 0Number of accepts 1312Number of rejects 2223456Number of challenges 0Number of malformed responses 0Number of bad authenticators 0Number of timeouts 1Number of unrecognized responses 0Firewall#   ```  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations that can be implemented for customers who are experiencing password spray attacks and have not upgraded to a fixed release. These mitigations are outlined in the [Recommendations Against Password Spray Attacks Aimed at Remote Access VPN Services in Secure Firewall](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/221806-password-spray-attacks-impacting-custome.html) TechNote.  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
