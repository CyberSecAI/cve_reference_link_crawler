- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Resource exhaustion due to a large number of VPN authentication requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper resource management when handling a high volume of authentication requests to the Remote Access VPN (RAVPN) service. This can lead to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the exhaustion of resources, causing a denial of service of the RAVPN service. Depending on the severity, a device reload may be required to restore the service. Services unrelated to VPN are not affected.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated attacker sends a large number of VPN authentication requests to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a large number of VPN authentication requests to the affected device's RAVPN service. No authentication or special privileges are needed. The attacker can be remote.
