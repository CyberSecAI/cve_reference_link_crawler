- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control on multiple NTT EAST Home GateWay/Hikari Denwa routers. Specifically, the devices fail to restrict access permissions, leading to unauthorized access to the device settings page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of sufficient access control, allowing an attacker to potentially access the device setting page from the WAN side if the IPv6 address is identified.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has identified a WAN-side IPv6 address of the affected router can access the device's setting page. This can lead to a compromise in confidentiality, potentially allowing the attacker to gain sensitive information about the router or make changes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to know the WAN-side IPv6 address of the target router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable router through the network, and they need to identify the WAN-side IPv6 address of the device. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
