**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web service for ONS-S8 - Spectra Aggregation Switch includes functions which do not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to traverse directories, bypass authentication, and execute remote code. Specifically, there is improper control of filenames for include/require statements in PHP programs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') (CWE-98)
- Weak Authentication (CWE-1390)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution
- Arbitrary file upload
- Authentication bypass

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely with low attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker can be unauthenticated.
