| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c0)  Nick Tait    2023-03-25 17:50:26 UTC  ``` A barbican configuration file is set to world-readable in Red Hat OpenStack. This presents a security risk as it allows authenticated attacker with limited access to the file to view its contents, including secure credential.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c3)  Nick Tait    2023-04-21 22:49:17 UTC  ``` Created openstack-barbican tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 2188734](show_bug.cgi?id=2188734 "NEW - CVE-2023-1633 openstack-barbican: Insecure Barbican configuration file leaking credential [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-04-24 19:34:42 UTC  ``` Hi,  (In reply to Nick Tait from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c0)) > A barbican configuration file is set to world-readable in Red Hat OpenStack. > This presents a security risk as it allows authenticated attacker with > limited access to the file to view its contents, including secure credential.  I'm trying to triage this CVE ([CVE-2023-1633](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1633)) for a downstream distribution but this bugzilla entry was the only cross-reference available. Can you share more on the CVE, does it affect upstream barbican and was it reported there?   Can you provide more information on it?  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c5)  Nick Tait    2023-04-25 18:38:07 UTC  ``` Yes, sorry for the sparse content at this stage. This is very likely the first public reference to this issue (along with [CVE-2023-1636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1636)). Both issues came via the same reporter. I believe they both only affect downstream RHOSP. I'm following up with the reporter to get more details. (Will not clear the needinfos as a reminder to myself)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-05-05 07:36:56 UTC  ``` Hi Nick,  (In reply to Nick Tait from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c5)) > Yes, sorry for the sparse content at this stage.

(Will not > clear the needinfos as a reminder to myself)  I see the needinfo was canclelled, did you got more information on this (and as you correctly pointed out [CVE-2023-1636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1636)) issues?  Thank you already!  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c9)  Nick Tait    2023-05-09 21:09:21 UTC  ``` Still waiting on reporter, but I did send them a reminder. Feel free to send me another needinfo in a few days...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c14)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2023-07-24 07:46:41 UTC  ``` Hi Nick,  (In reply to Nick Tait from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=2181761#c9)) > Still waiting on reporter, but I did send them a reminder.
