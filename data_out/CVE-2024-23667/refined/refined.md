- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation and improper authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The application does not properly validate user-supplied input, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
  - Improper Authorization (CWE-285): The application does not properly authorize users, allowing authenticated users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with at least read-only permissions can execute unauthorized actions. This could lead to unauthorized code execution or command execution.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP requests or CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated attacker with at least read-only permission.
