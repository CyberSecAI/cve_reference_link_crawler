As discussed over email, this fixes a security issue where a regular expression denial of service can be performed.

Exploit code is below:

```
import time
from pydantic import networks
from pydantic.networks import validate_email

start = time.time()

try:
    exploit_string = '<' + ' ' * 3000
    validate_email(exploit_string)
except:
    pass

print(f"Time elapsed: {time.time() - start}")
```

This has changed the intent of the regex - previously it only matched one or more characters, now it matches 0 characters. Admittedly the previous regex would match a space alone if the address was < > and this will not, but it is a change beyond the statement in the pull request.

Note for anyone coming to this in future, in [#7599](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/7599) (before releasing this PR) we reverted this change so the only actual change implemented is the length check which covers the original minor performance risk.
