The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47200.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition in the `drm_gem_prime_mmap` function within the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem of the Linux kernel.
- `drm_gem_ttm_mmap` drops a reference to the gem object on success. If the gem object's refcount is 1 when entering `drm_gem_prime_mmap`, the reference drop will free the gem object. Subsequently, a call to `drm_gem_object_get()` would result in a use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The gem object is freed prematurely, but then accessed again which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.
- Incorrect reference counting: The issue stems from the gem object's reference count being decremented too early in the mmap process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to various consequences, including:
    - Kernel crashes
    - Privilege escalation
    - Arbitrary code execution by manipulating the freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `mmap` system call which involves a gem object with a refcount of 1.
- Specifically, this occurs when a user-space process maps a Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) object into its memory space.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to trigger the `mmap` system call on a suitable DRM gem object.
- This may require some level of access to a graphics device.
- A local user could trigger this vulnerability.
