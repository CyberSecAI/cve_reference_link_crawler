# incorrect topic logging in raw\_log

Low

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-xchq-w5r3-4wg3
Apr 25, 2024

## Package

pip

0.3.10
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<= 0.3.10

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Summary

Incorrect values can be logged when `raw_log` builtin is called with memory or storage arguments to be used as topics.

A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. In particular, no uses of `raw_log()` were found at all in production; it is apparently not a well-known function.

### Details

The `build_IR` function of the `RawLog` class fails to properly unwrap the variables provided as topics. Consequently, incorrect values are logged as topics.

### PoC

```
x: bytes32

@external
def f():
    self.x = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
    raw_log([self.x], b"") # LOG1(offset:0x60, size:0x00, topic1:0x00)

    y: bytes32 = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
    raw_log([y], b"") # LOG1(offset:0x80, size:0x00, topic1:0x40)
```
### Patches

Fixed in [#3977](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3977).

### Impact

Incorrect values can be logged which may result in unexpected behavior in client-side applications relying on these logs.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32645

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
