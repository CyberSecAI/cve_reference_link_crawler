Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `newfaculty.php` file of the "Online Student Enrollment System Project In PHP".
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the "name" parameter.
- Attackers can inject malicious code from the "name" parameter which is used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `newfaculty.php` file.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of the "name" parameter.
- Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries without using prepared statements or parameter binding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering.
- Comprehensive system control.
- Potential service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `name` parameter in the `newfaculty.php` file.
- An attacker sends a malicious payload via a POST request to `/kccreg/newfaculty.php`.
- The vulnerable code directly uses the unsanitized input to construct a SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected server.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges within the application.
- They need to be able to reach the `newfaculty.php` page, typically through network access.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Online Student Enrollment System Project In PHP".
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) includes an example HTTP POST request demonstrating how the `name` parameter can be used to inject malicious SQL.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind and time-based blind techniques.
- SQLmap can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- Suggested remediation includes using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
