{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Slugs Manager plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that targets the vulnerable plugin, which is then executed within the user's authenticated session. The user is tricked into initiating the action without their knowledge.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious page or click a link, where the malicious request is triggered."
