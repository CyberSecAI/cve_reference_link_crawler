{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload files of non-zip types as a new plugin through the WordPress admin interface, specifically on the Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin screen.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is a lack of proper file type validation during plugin uploads. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended zip-file requirement and upload arbitrary files, which may include PHP files. Additionally, the temporary storage of these uploaded files in the Media Library, even when disallowed, can be exploited.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is especially true when the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant is set to `true` and FTP credentials are required for plugin/theme installation. In such a case, an administrator level user who is not normally able to execute arbitrary PHP code can now upload such code through this bypass. An attacker can upload arbitrary PHP code as if it was a plugin, and since it ends up in a temporary directory, it can be executed if the proper conditions are met.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can upload a non-zip file through the WordPress plugin upload functionality. This requires the attacker to be an administrator level user on a single site WordPress installation, or a Super Admin level user on Multisite installations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the WordPress plugin upload interface. The attacker must also be on a system configured where file edits are disallowed (`DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` is set to true), and where FTP credentials are required for uploading plugins or themes. They do not necessarily need to know these credentials, the simple request for credentials is enough for this exploit to work."
