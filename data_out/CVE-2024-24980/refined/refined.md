Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A protection mechanism failure in certain Intel Xeon processors.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in a flaw in a protection mechanism within the listed Intel Xeon processors, which can be exploited by a privileged user.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for **Escalation of Privilege**. This could allow an attacker to gain higher access than intended on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is **local access**, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system to be able to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a **privileged user** with local access to the system. The CVSS vectors also indicate a **high attack complexity** (AC:H) and require physical access for version 4.0.

**Additional Notes:**
* The affected products are 3rd, 4th, and 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.
* Intel recommends users update to the latest firmware provided by their system manufacturer to mitigate the issue.
* The vulnerability was found internally by Intel employees.
