Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3990:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2024-3990" and describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "HT Mega â€“ Absolute Addons For Elementor" plugin. This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Tooltip & Popover widgets of the HT Mega plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows users to inject arbitrary web scripts within the tooltip and popover text fields. This malicious code is stored in the database and executed when other users view pages containing these elements.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users viewing the affected page.
   - **Data Theft, Session Hijacking, Defacement:** This can lead to various malicious activities such as stealing sensitive data (cookies, session tokens), hijacking user sessions, and defacing the website.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Tooltip and Popover Widgets:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the text fields of the Tooltip and Popover widgets within the HT Mega plugin.
   - **Plugin Settings:** The vulnerability arises due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `popover_text` and `tooltip_text` attributes in the plugin's settings.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "contributor" level access to modify the content.
   - **Access to Plugin Settings:** The attacker must have the ability to add or modify elements using the HT Mega plugin and its widgets.

**Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable code is located in:
        - `ht-mega-for-elementor/tags/2.5.0/includes/widgets/htmega_tooltip.php` (Specifically line 620)
        - `ht-mega-for-elementor/tags/2.5.1/includes/widgets/htmega_popover.php`
   - The fix involves using `htmlspecialchars()` function to properly encode special characters in the `popover_text` and `tooltip_text` values before displaying them to prevent execution of malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided content also includes details about the fix, which was implemented in version 2.5.1 of the plugin. This involves using `htmlspecialchars()` when outputting the `popover_text` and `tooltip_text` attributes.
   - The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.5.0.
