- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper interface access control in AmdPspP2CmboxV2. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the ability to control the source buffer to point to the System Management Mode (SMM) memory. This is related to the size of the source buffer being altered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper interface access control, which allows an attacker to manipulate the source buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - SMM leaks, leading to potential disclosure of sensitive information within the SMM.
    - Ability to boot a UEFI shell, granting the attacker low-level control over the system.
    - Memory leaks, potentially leading to system instability or further exploitation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to manipulate the source buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system.
    - Ability to alter the size of the source buffer, which is possible via the improper interface access control in AmdPspP2CmboxV2.
