The provided content relates to CVE-2022-48882.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When updating a MAC security entity (SecY) in the hardware offload path, the MACsec security association (SA) initialization routine is called. If extended packet number (epn) is enabled, the salt and ssci attributes are retrieved using the MACsec driver rx_sa context. However, this context is unavailable when updating a SecY property, such as encoding-sa, which results in a null dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a null pointer dereference, which can cause a kernel crash or denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Updating a MAC security entity (SecY) in a specific scenario when extended packet number (epn) is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger an update to a MAC security entity (SecY) while extended packet numbers (epn) are enabled, which would typically require some form of privileged access or control over network configuration.
