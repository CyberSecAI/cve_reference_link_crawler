Prior to this Werk it was possible to inject HTML or Javascript (Reflected XSS).
A legitimate user tricked to click on a prepared link would then run arbitrary Javascript code in a valid session.

This vulnerability is only triggerable if another *Business Intelligence* *BI pack* (next to the default) was created.

We found this vulnerability internally.

**Affected Versions**:
\* 2.2.0
\* 2.1.0
\* 2.0.0
\* 1.6.0 (probably older versions as well)

**Indicators of Compromise**:
To check for exploitation one can check the site apache access log var/log/apache/access\_log for entries like /$SITENAME/check\_mk/wato.py?mode=bi\_aggregations&bulk\_moveto=.
The order of the URL paramters can be changed by an attacker.
Potential injected code would be in the parameter bulk\_moveto.

**Vulnerability Management**:
We have rated the issue with a CVSS Score of 5.4 (Medium) with the following CVSS vector:
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
We assigned CVE-2023-23548 to this vulnerability.

**Changes**:
This Werk introduces escaping for the vulnerable parameter.
