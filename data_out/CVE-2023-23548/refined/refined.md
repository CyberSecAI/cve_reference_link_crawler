- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'bulk_moveto' parameter when creating Business Intelligence (BI) packs, allowing for the injection of HTML or JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a valid user's session by tricking the user into clicking on a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the 'bulk_moveto' parameter. This requires the user to click on the prepared malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious link with injected HTML or JavaScript code in the 'bulk_moveto' parameter. The user must have a valid session and needs to be tricked into clicking the link. The vulnerability is only triggerable if another BI pack (next to the default) was created.
