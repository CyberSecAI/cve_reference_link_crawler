## Compatibility changes

* Change the default value of the system variable [`tidb_analyze_version`](/pingcap/tidb/blob/v5.3.1/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_version-new-in-v510) from `2` to `1` [#31748](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/31748)
* Since v5.1.4, if TiKV is configured with `storage.enable-ttl = true`, the requests from TiDB are rejected, because the TTL feature of TiKV only supports the [RawKV mode](https://tikv.org/docs/5.1/concepts/explore-tikv-features/ttl/) [#27303](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27303)

* Fix the issue that INDEX HASH JOIN returns the `send on closed channel` error [#31129](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/31129)
* Fix the issue that using the [`BatchCommands`](/pingcap/tidb/blob/v5.3.1/tidb-configuration-file.md#max-batch-size) API might block sending TiDB requests to TiKV in some rare cases [#32500](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/32500)
* Fix the issue of potential data index inconsistency in optimistic transaction mode [#30410](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/30410)

# TiDB authentication bypass vulnerability

High

[haohaoxuex2005](/haohaoxuex2005)
published
GHSA-4whx-7p29-mq22
May 26, 2022

## Package

gomod

TiDB
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

=5.3.0

## Patched versions

5.3.1

## Description

### Impact

Under certain conditions, an attacker can construct malicious authentication requests to bypass the authentication process, resulting in privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

Only users using TiDB 5.3.0 are affected by this vulnerability.

### Patches

Please upgrade to TiDB 5.3.1 or higher version

### Workarounds

You can also mitigate risks by taking the following measures.

Option 1: Turn off SEM (Security Enhanced Mode).

Option 2: Disable local login for non-root accounts and ensure that the same IP cannot be logged in as root or normal user at the same time.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
