In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb3: fix temporary data corruption in collapse range

collapse range doesn't discard the affected cached region
so can risk temporarily corrupting the file data. This
fixes xfstest generic/031

I also decided to merge a minor cleanup to this into the same patch
(avoiding rereading inode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it
clearer.
