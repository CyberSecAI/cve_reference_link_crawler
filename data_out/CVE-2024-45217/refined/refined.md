Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45217:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Solr handles ConfigSets created during a backup restore operation. When a ConfigSet is created via the restore command, it does not properly set the "trusted" metadata. If this metadata is missing, Solr implicitly trusts the ConfigSet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Initialization:** ConfigSets created during a restore are not explicitly marked as trusted or untrusted, leading to a default assumption of trust.
*   **Implicit Trust:** The system implicitly trusts ConfigSets when the "trusted" metadata is absent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can create a backup containing a malicious ConfigSet, and then restore it, the ConfigSet will be implicitly trusted and therefore, be able to load custom code via classloaders. This can lead to RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to create a backup of an Apache Solr instance which contains malicious configsets, then they need to restore it. This can be done if an attacker has access to the backup files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to perform a backup/restore operation, either by having authenticated access or having access to the Solr backup directory.
*   The attacker must be able to create a malicious ConfigSet which is included in a backup.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated when restoring the backup.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 before 8.11.4 and 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to version 8.11.4 or 9.7.0.
*   The vulnerability can also be mitigated by enabling authentication and authorization on the Solr instance.
