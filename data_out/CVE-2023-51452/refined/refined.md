- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing input size check in the `pull_file_v2_proc` function within the `libv2_sdk.so` library. This library is used by the `dji_vtwo_sdk` binary, which implements the `v2_sdk_service`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation. Specifically, the lack of a size check when processing input for the `pull_file_v2_proc` function allows an attacker to send a crafted payload that triggers a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the `v2_sdk_service`. This affects the availability of the service running on the drone.
- **Attack vectors**: An adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be in a network adjacent position and be able to send crafted network packets to the droneâ€™s service listening on port 10000. The attacker also needs to have the ability to craft a malicious payload to trigger the crash.
