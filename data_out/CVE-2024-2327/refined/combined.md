### Description

The Global Elementor Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the button link URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

I’m a relative beginner to Elementor and WordPress in general. You have created a great tool with more button options, but not really explained how or where to apply the CSS styling. For those of us not familiar with Bootstrap or styling guidelines just a simple addition to the read-me with examples would be SO helpful. Could be a great plugin if you can just think about who your potential users are. There is one little view in the screenshots, and without that I would have been lost.
Thanks for your consideration.
