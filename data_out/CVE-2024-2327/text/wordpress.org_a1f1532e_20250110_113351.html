I’m a relative beginner to Elementor and WordPress in general. You have created a great tool with more button options, but not really explained how or where to apply the CSS styling. For those of us not familiar with Bootstrap or styling guidelines just a simple addition to the read-me with examples would be SO helpful. Could be a great plugin if you can just think about who your potential users are. There is one little view in the screenshots, and without that I would have been lost.
Thanks for your consideration.
