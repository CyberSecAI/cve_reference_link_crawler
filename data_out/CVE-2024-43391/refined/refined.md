  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of special characters within the `FW_PORTFORWARDING.SRC_IP` environment variable, which is used to configure firewall services.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A low-privileged remote attacker can make configuration changes to firewall services like packet filtering, packet forwarding, network access control, and NAT. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed remotely via network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with remote access to the affected mGuard device."
