WOW! I honestly never expected this much transparency on which security improvements were made in the firmware! I like that you waited a while to post it all so that most people will have had the time to update to the new firmware first, and then revealed how busy you’ve been making improvements since way back in November. Sounds like Wyze has made a lot of active effort in looking for more and more things to improve security constantly as promised. I just never expected you’d be transparent about so many of the things you’ve been working on that weren’t public yet. This is great!

Wow, that’s a lot of fixes, and it’s cool to see how much work is being done on these issues.

It also goes to show how important it is to keep your devices up to date.

Thanks for this list, and thanks for not releasing it till we got updated!

![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/facebook_messenger/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

I noticed the Video Doorbell Pro has not gotten an update in a while 1.0.73 3/1/2023.

Hopefully it is OK!
