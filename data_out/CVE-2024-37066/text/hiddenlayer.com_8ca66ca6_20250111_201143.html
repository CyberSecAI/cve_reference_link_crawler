# Wyze Cam V4 Vulnerability Report

###### Jul 19, 2024

## Crafted WiFI network name (SSID) leads to arbitrary command injection

#### CVE Number

CVE-2024-37066

#### Summary

The *net\_service\_thread*function in *libwyzeUtilsPlatform.so* spawns a shell command containing a user-specified WiFi network name (SSID) in an unsafe way, which can lead to arbitrary command injection as root during the camera setup process.

#### Products Impacted

This vulnerability is present in *Wyze Cam V4* firmware versions up to and including 4.52.4.9887.

#### CVSS Score: 6.8

AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#### CWE Categorization

CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

#### Details

This vulnerability is caused by the net\_service\_thread function in the */system/lib/libwyzeUtilsPlatform.so* library.

```
00004604 snprintf(&str, 0x3fb, "iwlist wlan0 scan | grep \'ESSID:\"%s\"\'", 0x18054, var_938, var_934, var_930, err_21, var_928);
00004618 int32_t $v0_6 = exec_shell_sync(&str, &var_918);
```

The *net\_service\_thread* function is used by the *init\_net\_service* function which is invoked by */system/bin/iCamera* during the camera setup process. The purpose of this function is to initialize the camera’s wireless networking.

The user-specified WiFi network name (SSID) provided during the camera setup is passed to a shell command without sanitization. An attacker within Bluetooth range of the camera can exploit this by specifying a network name containing a command enclosed in single quotes followed by a semicolon.

To replicate this vulnerability, the Wyze app can send the camera a crafted WiFi network name containing the command to execute.

After hitting the Connect button, the command will be sent to the camera over Bluetooth and executed through the *exec\_shell\_exec*function. In the example pictured above, the command *whoami* is executed, and the output is piped to a file named pwned.txt on the root of the camera’s SD card.

The command injection is saved to the camera’s config and persists across reboots. During our testing, we found that it was possible to brick the camera by providing it with a WiFi network name containing the reboot command.

This resulted in the camera going into an endless reboot loop that we could not exit.
