- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the `formWifiBasicSet` function due to the use of `strcpy` to copy a user-controlled parameter into a fixed-size buffer without proper length validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution could be achieved by overwriting the return address on the stack. The provided PoC shows an attempt to overwrite the return address with `0xdeadbeef`.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `/goform/WifiBasicSet` with the `security_5g` parameter set to a string longer than 256 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable device, which is presumably within the network where the router is located.
