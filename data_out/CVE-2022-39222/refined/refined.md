Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39222:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a predictable request ID used in the `/approval` endpoint, which allowed an attacker to fetch the OAuth authorization code before the legitimate user. The Dex instance used the state parameter received during the initial redirect to the connector IDP as the request ID, which was not protected. This allowed an attacker to repeatedly poll the `/approval` endpoint using the known state and potentially intercept the authorization code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Predictable request ID:** The use of the state parameter as the request ID for the `/approval` endpoint made it predictable and vulnerable to interception.
- **Lack of message authentication:** The absence of message authentication or any mechanism to verify the legitimacy of the `/approval` request allowed the attacker to forge requests.
- **Backchannel attack:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to use a side channel (polling the approval endpoint) to steal the authorization code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** By intercepting the authorization code, the attacker could exchange it for an ID token, gaining unauthorized access to applications that accept tokens from the vulnerable Dex instance.
- **Account takeover:** If the targeted applications were not protected against replay attacks, the attacker could potentially gain full control of a victim's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** The attack is initiated by luring a victim to a malicious website.
- **OIDC flow manipulation:** The attacker guides the victim through a manipulated OIDC flow, intercepting the authorization code.
- **Polling the `/approval` endpoint:** The attacker polls the `/approval` endpoint using the predictable request ID to obtain the OAuth code before the legitimate user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious website:** The attacker needs to host a website to initiate the attack.
- **Ability to intercept the OIDC flow:** The attacker needs to intercept the redirect from dex to the IDP and the return redirect to dex.
- **Ability to make HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to make HTTP requests to the `/approval` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of the state parameter:** The attacker needs to obtain and know the value of the state parameter.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- **Mitigation:** The fix involves adding an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a randomly generated per-request secret. This makes the request ID unpredictable and prevents the attacker from polling `/approval` endpoint. The HMAC key is stored within the auth request object and validated on access to `/approval`.
- **Affected Versions:** Dex versions <= 2.34.0 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.35.0.
- **Workarounds:** Disabling public clients is the only known workaround, which impacts behavior.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score is 9.3, categorized as critical.
- **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low.
- **User interaction:** User interaction is required.
- **Scope:** The scope is changed, meaning a vulnerable component can impact resources outside its security scope.
- **Confidentiality & Integrity:** The impact on confidentiality and integrity is high.

The commit diff shows the changes made to address this vulnerability, specifically the addition of HMAC verification in `server/handlers.go` and `server/oauth2.go`, changes to the storage layer to persist the HMAC key as well.
