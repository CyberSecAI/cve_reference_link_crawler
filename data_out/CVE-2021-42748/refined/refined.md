Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-42748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Beaver Builder and Beaver Themer handle visibility settings and conditional logic for content. When text or image modules are added, their raw data is saved to the WordPress `post_content`.
*   The visibility settings were ignored when publishing the layout. As a result, when WordPress displayed the post excerpt, it used everything it found in `post_content`, including content that was supposed to be hidden, and this content was exposed via the WordPress REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Content that was intended to be hidden based on visibility rules or conditional logic was accessible to unauthorized users through the WordPress REST API. This means that information meant to be seen only by logged-in users or those with specific roles could be viewed by anyone.
*   The core problem was that visibility settings were not respected when retrieving content via the REST API or when generating excerpts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Content:** Attackers could bypass intended content restrictions, viewing information that should have been kept private.
*  **Potential Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  If the hidden content contained sensitive data, this could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WordPress REST API:** An unauthenticated user could send a request to the WordPress REST API "Posts" endpoint and retrieve the content that was supposed to be hidden.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker didn't need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability via the REST API, so any user (or anonymous user) could exploit this.
*   **Basic knowledge of WordPress REST API** : Attacker needs to be able to make requests to the WordPress REST API.
