- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Comments Ratings plugin lacks CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious request that targets a vulnerable functionality in the plugin. This request is then sent to a logged in user, who unknowingly executes it, while authenticated on the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to trigger a malicious request. The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
