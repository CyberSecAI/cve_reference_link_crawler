JetPlugins changed the web development paradigm with WordPress. They broke down the barriers that made it impossible for someone without advanced coding knowledge to create web pages handling complex dynamic data. As a trainer of thousands of Spanish-speaking users, I can say that JetPlugins has become the primary tool for any web developer, regardless of their level, to be able to offer digital business solutions to their clients.
