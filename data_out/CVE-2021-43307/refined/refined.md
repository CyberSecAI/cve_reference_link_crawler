- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability exists in the semver-regex npm package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `test` method in semver-regex is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack due to an inefficient regular expression.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by supplying a specially crafted string to the vulnerable method, leading to excessive resource consumption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through providing arbitrary input to the vulnerable `test` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `test` method of the `semver-regex` package.
