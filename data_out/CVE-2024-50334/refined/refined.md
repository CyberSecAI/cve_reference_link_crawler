- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Semicolon path injection in the `/api;/config` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Semicolon path injection allows bypassing authentication.
    - Unrestricted file reading via HOCON file inclusion through `PUT` requests with `Content-Type: application/hocon`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data.
    - Retrieval of sensitive information such as configuration files from the server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - By appending a semicolon to the `/api/config` endpoint URL.
    - Using `PUT` requests to the `/api;/config` endpoint with the header `Content-Type: application/hocon` to trigger file inclusion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the vulnerable server.
    - Ability to craft HTTP requests with specific headers and URL parameters.
