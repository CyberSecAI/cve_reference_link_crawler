# Semicolon Path Injection on API /api;/config

Critical

[albogdano](/albogdano)
published
GHSA-fhwp-f6g7-rr3p
Oct 29, 2024

## Package

maven

com.erudika.scoold
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.64.0

## Patched versions

1.64.0

## Description

### Impact

A semicolon path injection vulnerability was found on the `/api;/config` endpoint. By appending a semicolon in the URL, attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorised access to sensitive configuration data. Furthermore, `PUT` requests on the `/api;/config` endpoint while setting the `Content-Type: application/hocon` header allow unauthenticated attackers to file reading via HOCON file inclusion. This allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information such as configuration files from the server, which can be leveraged for further exploitation.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in Scoold `1.64.0`

### Workarounds

A workaround would be to disable the Scoold API with `scoold.api_enabled = false`

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-50334

### Weaknesses

[CWE-288](/advisories?query=cwe%3A288)
