Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `add-ticket.php` file of the Food Ordering Management System v1.0.
*   The `id` parameter in the POST request is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation or sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `add-ticket.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to directly obtain sensitive server information.
*   **Database Compromise:** A malicious attacker could potentially gain access to and manipulate the server's database, leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/foms/routers/add-ticket.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The `id` parameter is the primary attack vector where malicious SQL code is injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, as the vulnerable code is in `/foms/routers/add-ticket.php` which seems to be accessible without prior authentication.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques and be able to craft malicious SQL queries to retrieve or manipulate data from the server's database.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the basic structure of the attack, including the HTTP request, content type, parameters, and a simple SQL injection attempt in the id parameter.
*   The content also includes screenshots of using SQLMap to retrieve the database username, indicating successful exploitation and data exfiltration.
*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Food Ordering Management System - 1.0," and a link to the software's download page is provided.
*   The vulnerability is rated as CRITICAL.

This information is consistent with the description of a SQL injection vulnerability and provides technical details for exploitation.
