| [@annando](https://github.com/annando) Please have a look at this issue when you have some time. This is a security issue similar to [#13884](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/issues/13884) and puts users at risk. Assume there are two users Bob and Alice. This issue allows Bob to store javascript payload into his profile which then gets executed by Alice's browser when she visits Bobs profile page, with which bob can perform administrative/other actions on behalf of Alice. I have demonstrated how Bob can show a simple alertbox when Alice visits Bobs profile page. To fix this issue, one option is to please sanitise the three parameters *homepage*, *xmpp* and *matrix* using `htmlspecialchars` before storing them to the DB or before outputting them on the profile page. |

| For those stumbling on this issue, I created an XSS worm using this vulnerability similar to the Samy is my hero attack against Myspace but against friendica. The exploit can be found here: [friendica-xss-worm](https://github.com/Devilx86/friendica-xss-worm) |

For details, please the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/blob/stable/CHANGELOG) file in the repository.

## What is Friendica

Friendica is a decentralised communications platform, you can use to host your own social media server that integrates with independent social networking platforms (like the Fediverse or Diaspora\*) but also some commercial ones like Tumbler and BlueSky.

## How to Update

### Updating from old Friendica versions

If you are updating from an older version than the 2022.12 release, please first [update your Friendica instance to that version](https://friendi.ca/2022/12/20/friendica-2022-12-released/) as it contained some breaking changes.

### Pre-Update Procedures

Ensure that the last backup of your Friendica installation was done recently.

### Using Git

Updating from the git repositories should only involve a pull from the Friendica core repository and addons repository, regardless of the branch (stable or develop) you are using. Remember to update the dependencies with composer as well. So, assuming that you are on the `stable` branch, the commands to update your installation to the 2024.08 release would be

```
cd friendica
git pull
bin/composer.phar install --no-dev
cd addon
git pull

```

If you want to use a different branch than the `stable` one, you need to fetch and checkout the branch before your perform the *git pull*.

Pulling in the dependencies with composer will show some deprecation warning, we will be working on that in the upcoming release.

### Using the Archive Files

**Due to problems with the build pipeline we cannot provide archive files at the moment that contain all dependencies as usual. We will update this documents as soon as possible.**

**Do not use the archive files provided by github as they does not contain the dependencies.**

### Post Update Tasks

The database update should be applied automatically, but sometimes it gets stuck. If you encounter this, please initiate the DB update manually from the command line by running the script

```
bin/console dbstructure update

```

from the base of your Friendica installation. If the output contains any error message, please let us know using the channels mentioned below.

**Please note**, that some of the changes to the database structure will take some time to be applied, depending on the size of your Friendica database this update might run for days.

## Known Issues

*At the time of writing this, none*

Ensure that the last backup of your Friendica installation was done recently.

### Using Git

Remember to update the dependencies with composer as well. So, assuming that you are on the `stable` branch, the commands to update your installation to the 2024.08 release would be

Pulling in the dependencies with composer will show some deprecation warning, we will be working on that in the upcoming release.

### Using the Archive Files

If you had downloaded the source files in an archive file (tar.gz) please download the current version of the archive from [friendica-full-2024.08.tar.gz](https://files.friendi.ca/friendica-full-2024.08.tar.gz) ([sha256](https://files.friendi.ca/friendica-full-2024.08.tar.gz.sum256)) and [friendica-addons 2024.08.tar.gz](https://files.friendi.ca/friendica-addons-2024.08.tar.gz) ([sha256](https://files.friendi.ca/friendica-addons-2024.08.tar.gz.sum256))) and unpack it on your local computer.

As many files got deleted or moved around, please upload the unpacked files to a new directory on your server (say `friendica_new`) and copy over your existing configuration (`config/local.config.php` and `config/addon.config.php`) and `.htaccess` files. Afterwards rename your current Friendica directory (e.g. friendica) to `friendica_old` and `friendica_new` to `friendica`.

The files of the dependencies are included in the archive (make sure you are using the friendica-full-2024.08 archive), so you don‚Äôt have to worry about them.

### Post Update Tasks

The database update should be applied automatically, but sometimes it gets stuck. If you encounter this, please initiate the DB update manually from the command line by running the script

```
bin/console dbstructure update
```

from the base of your Friendica installation. If the output contains any error message, please let us know using the channels mentioned below.

**Please note**, that some of the changes to the database structure will take some time to be applied, depending on the size of your Friendica database this update might run for days during which the site might not be accessible.
