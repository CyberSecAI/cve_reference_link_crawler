Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-47250:

**CVE-2021-47250**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory leak occurs in the `netlbl_cipsov4_add_std` function within the Linux kernel's netlabel subsystem. The memory pointed to by `doi_def->map.std` is allocated but not freed under certain conditions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A memory leak vulnerability exists due to the failure to free allocated memory when a CIPSO (Commercial Internet Protocol Security Option) Domain of Interpretation (DOI) is freed. Specifically, the memory pointed to by `doi_def->map.std` is allocated in `netlbl_cipsov4_add_std`, but not deallocated in `cipso_v4_doi_free`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Repeated triggering of the vulnerable code can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting available memory.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through network operations that involve netlabel and CIPSOv4. It can be triggered by sending specific netlink messages related to CIPSOv4. The `syzkaller` tool was used to identify this issue, so it is likely that an attacker would need to send crafted network packets to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to send network messages to the target system to trigger the vulnerability. This may require network access to the system, either directly or via an adjacent network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by the syzkaller fuzzer and reported by Hulk Robot.
*   The fix involves adding `kfree(doi_def->map.std)` in `cipso_v4_doi_free` before the `break` statement, ensuring that the allocated memory is freed when the DOI resource is deallocated.
*   The fix was backported to numerous stable kernel versions.
*   The commit message also references the commit that introduced the bug.
