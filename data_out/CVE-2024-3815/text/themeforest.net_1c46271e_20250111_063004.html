* Get the opportunity to access global audiences, including the millions of people that read content from right to left;

### AutoUpdate System

Updating Newspaper Theme has never been so easy. Starting with Newspaper Theme v. 10.3.1 when a theme update is available, you can install the latest version with a single click, directly from the theme panel. The system downloads the latest version from the tagDiv servers and automatically updates the theme’s files and the native plugins so that you can focus on the content;

Theme Update Notifications – When an update is available, you’ll see a notification in the WordPress Admin interface (wp-admin);

Newspaper theme creates auto-backup for the settings – Every time you click the Save button in the Theme Panel Save, the system creates a backup copy for the previous version. With Newspaper Theme now you can turn back time and restore the before-the-change settings;

We personally respond to all the requests that we receive and we are trying to help everyone.

**Newspaper is fast**

The theme is blazing fast. It’s really incredible how fast the pages built with Newspaper are loading! As you know, speed is very important when building a site so we’ve spent a huge amount of time optimizing this theme so that Newspaper loads extremely fast.

**Long time support and development**

We can easily send updates to ThemeForest each time we make an improvement so with each purchase you will fund the further development of the Newspaper theme.

**Small number of external scripts**

You can easily add your own JavaScripts without worrying about incompatibilities between the theme and your scripts. Newspaper uses a very small number of external libraries so it’s very easy to add new features to this theme.

**Good coding practice and naming conventions**

All the html used is HTML 5 valid and it’s incredibly easy to work with.
