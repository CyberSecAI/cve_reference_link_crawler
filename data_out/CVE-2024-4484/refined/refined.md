- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'xai_username' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is triggered through the 'xai_username' parameter within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level permissions or higher.
