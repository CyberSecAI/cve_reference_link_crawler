# Backtracking regular expressions cause ReDoS

Moderate

GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j
Sep 9, 2024

## Package

npm

path-to-regexp
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=7.0.0, <8.0.0
>=0.2.0,<1.9.0
<0.1.10
>=2.0.0, <3.3.0
>=4.0.0, <6.3.0

## Patched versions

8.0.0
1.9.0
0.1.10
3.3.0
6.3.0

## Description

### Impact

A bad regular expression is generated any time you have two parameters within a single segment, separated by something that is not a period (`.`). For example, `/:a-:b`.

### Patches

For users of 0.1, upgrade to `0.1.10`. All other users should upgrade to `8.0.0`.

These versions add backtrack protection when a custom regex pattern is not provided:

* [0.1.10](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v0.1.10)
* [1.9.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v1.9.0)
* [3.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
* [6.3.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.3.0)

They do not protect against vulnerable user supplied capture groups. Protecting against explicit user patterns is out of scope for old versions and not considered a vulnerability.

Version [7.1.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v7.1.0) can enable `strict: true` and get an error when the regular expression might be bad.

Version [8.0.0](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v8.0.0) removes the features that can cause a ReDoS.

### Workarounds

All versions can be patched by providing a custom regular expression for parameters after the first in a single segment. As long as the custom regular expression does not match the text before the parameter, you will be safe. For example, change `/:a-:b` to `/:a-:b([^-/]+)`.

If paths cannot be rewritten and versions cannot be upgraded, another alternative is to limit the URL length. For example, halving the attack string improves performance by 4x faster.

### Details

Using `/:a-:b` will produce the regular expression `/^\/([^\/]+?)-([^\/]+?)\/?$/`. This can be exploited by a path such as `/a${'-a'.repeat(8_000)}/a`. [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) has a good example of why this occurs, but the TL;DR is the `/a` at the end ensures this route would never match but due to naive backtracking it will still attempt every combination of the `:a-:b` on the repeated 8,000 `-a`.

Because JavaScript is single threaded and regex matching runs on the main thread, poor performance will block the event loop and can lead to a DoS. In local benchmarks, exploiting the unsafe regex will result in performance that is over 1000x worse than the safe regex. In a more realistic environment using Express v4 and 10 concurrent connections, this translated to average latency of ~600ms vs 1ms.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
