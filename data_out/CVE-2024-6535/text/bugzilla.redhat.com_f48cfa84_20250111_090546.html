| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2296024#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-07-05 19:46:41 UTC  ``` When skupper (RHSI) is initialized with the console-enabled and with console-auth set to openshift, it configures the openshift oauth-proxy with a static cookie-secret 'SECRET'. This has been shown to allow forged cookies to be used to bypass authentication for the skupper console.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2296024#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-25 10:41:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Service Interconnect 1.4 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:4865 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4865](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4865)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2296024#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-25 14:29:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Service Interconnect 1 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2024:4871 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4871](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4871)   ``` |  |
