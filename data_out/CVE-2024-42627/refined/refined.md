The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in FrogCMS V0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection in the `/admin/?/snippet/delete/3` endpoint. This allows an attacker to forge a request to delete a snippet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that appear to come from an authorized user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly deleting a snippet within the application. This can lead to data loss and potentially disrupt the functionality of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. This form is embedded in a website controlled by the attacker or delivered through other means, such as phishing.
- When a logged-in user visits this malicious page, the browser will automatically submit the request to the vulnerable endpoint, deleting the specified snippet without the user's awareness.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTML code that automatically submits a form to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting their crafted HTML page.
- The user needs to be logged into the vulnerable FrogCMS instance.
