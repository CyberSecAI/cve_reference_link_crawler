- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SLA (Service Level Agreement) titles were rendered as HTML in the view page without proper escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML into SLA titles, which will then be executed when a user views the affected page. This could potentially lead to the compromise of user sessions or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to inject the malicious HTML into the SLA titles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the SLA titles, likely requiring a low-privileged account. They must also be able to induce a victim to view the crafted page.
