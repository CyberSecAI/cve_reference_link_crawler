In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Fix coverity issue with unintentional integer overflow

1. Instead of multiplying 2 variable of different types. Change to
assign a value of one variable and then multiply the other variable.

2. Add a int variable for multiplier calculation instead of calculating
different types multiplier with dma_addr_t variable directly.
