# Public key confusion in third party block

Low

[Geal](/Geal)
published
GHSA-5hcj-rwm6-xmw4
Jul 31, 2024

## Package

maven

org.biscuitsec.biscuit-auth
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

## Description

### Impact

Tokens with third-party blocks containing trusted annotations generated through a third party block request. Due to implementation issues in biscuit-java, third party block support in published versions is inoperating. Nevertheless, to synchronize with other implementations, we publish this advisory and the related fix.

### Description

Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:

the public key of the previous block (used in the signature)

the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions)

A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.

Consider the following example (nominal case)

* Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty("b") trusting ${pubkeyB}`
* The well-behaving holder then generates a third-party block request based on the token and sends it to third-party authority B
* Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyC}`
* The token holder now must obtain a third-party block from third party C to be able to use the token

Now, with a malicious user:

* Authority A emits the following token: `check if thirdparty("b") trusting ${pubkeyB}`
* The holder then attenuates the token with the following third party block `thirdparty("c")`, signed with a keypair pubkeyD, privkeyD) they generate
* The holder then generates a third-party block request based on this token, but alter the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` publicKeys field and replace pubkeyD with pubkeyC
* Third-party B generates the following third-party block `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyC}`
* Due to the altered symbol table, the actual meaning of the block is `thirdparty("b"); check if thirdparty("c") trusting ${pubkeyD}`
* The attacker can now use the token without obtaining a third-party block from C.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
