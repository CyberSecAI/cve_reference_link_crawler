SUMMARY

Siemens has been made aware of a default password leakage in the internet affecting the component
Shared HIS (SHHIS) used in Spectrum Power systems.

The products listed below are affected by this default password leakage. This could allow an attacker to
access the component Shared HIS of those products with administrative privileges by using an account
with default credentials.

Siemens offers conﬁguration recommendations for the affected products in order to mitigate the issue.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Spectrum Power provides basic components for SCADA, communications, and data modeling for con-
trol and monitoring systems. Application suites can be added to optimize network and generation
management for all areas of energy management.

The Siemens Spectrum Power Microgrid Management System (MGMS) is an advanced control and
optimization software, used to maximize the value of your onsite energy resources in coordination with
local utility or wholesale market rates.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-26476

An unauthenticated attacker could log into the component Shared HIS used in Spectrum Power
systems by using an account with default credentials. A successful exploitation could allow the
attacker to access the component Shared HIS with administrative privileges.
