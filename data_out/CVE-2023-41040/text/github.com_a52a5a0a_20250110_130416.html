# Blind local file inclusion

Moderate

[Byron](/Byron)
published
GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c
Aug 26, 2023

## Package

pip

gitpython
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.1.36

## Patched versions

3.1.37

## Description

### Summary

In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system.

### Details

This vulnerability is present in

[GitPython/git/refs/symbolic.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175)

Lines 174 to 175
in
[1c8310d](/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf)

|  | with open(os.path.join(repodir, str(ref\_path)), "rt", encoding="UTF-8") as fp: |
| --- | --- |
|  | value = fp.read().rstrip() |

That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if the final path is located outside the base directory.

I was able to exploit it from three places, but there may be more code paths that lead to it:

[GitPython/git/repo/base.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L605)

| --- | --- |

### PoC

Running GitPython within any repo should work, here is an example with the GitPython repo.

```
import git

r = git.Repo(".")

# This will make GitPython read the README.md file from the root of the repo
r.commit("../README.md")
r.tree("../README.md")
r.index.diff("../README.md")

# Reading /etc/random
# WARNING: this will probably halt your system, run with caution
# r.commit("../../../../../../../../../dev/random")
```
### Impact

I wasn't able to show the contents of the files (that's why "blind" local file inclusion), depending on how GitPython is being used, this can be used by an attacker for something *inoffensive* as checking if a file exits, or cause a DoS by making GitPython read a big/infinite file (like `/dev/random` on Linux systems).

### Possible solutions

A solution would be to check that the final path isn't located outside the `repodir` path (maybe even after resolving symlinks). Maybe there could be other checks in place to make sure that the reference names are valid.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
