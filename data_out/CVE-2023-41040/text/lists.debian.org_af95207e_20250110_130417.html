Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3589-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : python-git
Version        : 2.1.11-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-41040

Santos Gallegos discovered a blind local file inclusion in python-git, a
Python library to interact with Git repositories, which could lead to
denial of service or potentially information disclosure.

In order to resolve some git references, python-git reads files from the
".git" directory but, due to improper location check, an attacker can
pass a file located outside this directory thereby making python-git
read arbitrary file on the system.

It remains unclear whether the attacker can gain access to actual file
content, but denial of service can be achieved by passing a large or
infinite file such as /dev/random.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.11-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-git packages.

For the detailed security status of python-git please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-git>
