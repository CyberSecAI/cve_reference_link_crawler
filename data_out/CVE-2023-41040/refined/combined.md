# Blind local file inclusion

Moderate

[Byron](/Byron)
published
GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c
Aug 26, 2023

## Package

pip

gitpython
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.1.36

## Patched versions

3.1.37

## Description

### Summary

In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system.

### Details

This vulnerability is present in

[GitPython/git/refs/symbolic.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175)

Lines 174 to 175
in
[1c8310d](/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf)

|  | with open(os.path.join(repodir, str(ref\_path)), "rt", encoding="UTF-8") as fp: |
| --- | --- |
|  | value = fp.read().rstrip() |

That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if the final path is located outside the base directory.

I was able to exploit it from three places, but there may be more code paths that lead to it:

[GitPython/git/repo/base.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/repo/base.py#L605)

|  | def diff( |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

Running GitPython within any repo should work, here is an example with the GitPython repo.

```
import git

r = git.Repo(".")

# This will make GitPython read the README.md file from the root of the repo
r.commit("../README.md")
r.tree("../README.md")
r.index.diff("../README.md")

# Reading /etc/random
# WARNING: this will probably halt your system, run with caution
# r.commit("../../../../../../../../../dev/random")
```
### Impact

I wasn't able to show the contents of the files (that's why "blind" local file inclusion), depending on how GitPython is being used, this can be used by an attacker for something *inoffensive* as checking if a file exits, or cause a DoS by making GitPython read a big/infinite file (like `/dev/random` on Linux systems).

### Possible solutions

A solution would be to check that the final path isn't located outside the `repodir` path (maybe even after resolving symlinks). Maybe there could be other checks in place to make sure that the reference names are valid.

Package        : python-git
Version        : 2.1.11-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-41040

Santos Gallegos discovered a blind local file inclusion in python-git, a
Python library to interact with Git repositories, which could lead to
denial of service or potentially information disclosure.

In order to resolve some git references, python-git reads files from the
".git" directory but, due to improper location check, an attacker can
pass a file located outside this directory thereby making python-git
read arbitrary file on the system.

It remains unclear whether the attacker can gain access to actual file
content, but denial of service can be achieved by passing a large or
infinite file such as /dev/random.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.11-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-git packages.

For the detailed security status of python-git please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-git>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read is provided by the user, GitPython doesn''t check if this file is located outside the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make GitPython read any file from the system. This vulnerability is present in https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae144f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175. That code joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if the final path is located outside the base directory. This vulnerability cannot be used to read the contents of files but could in theory be used to trigger a denial of service for the program.

| To add a bit more context: I followed the general approach [mentioned](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1644#issuecomment-1728908720) by [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron) and used by [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/a9da3f84b979aa25225a819428b85bff6290da9b/gix-validate/src/reference.rs#L47), which is a `for` loop that iterates over each character, with memory of the previous two characters seen. This is faster than the naive approach (since we minimize the amount of times we iterate over the refname string), at the cost of some readability.  For comparison, here's the naive approach, where the logic separation matches [the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format) (one rule per `if` condition):  ``` def _check_ref_name_valid_naive(ref_path: PathLike) -> None:     # Based on https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format/     if any([component.startswith(".") or component.endswith(".lock") for component in ref_path.split("/")]):         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': components cannot start with '.' or end with '.lock'")     elif ".." in str(ref_path):         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot contain '..'")     elif any([ord(c) < 32 or ord(c) == 127 or c in [" ", "~", "^", ":"] for c in ref_path]):         raise ValueError(             f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot contain ASCII control characters, spaces, tildes (~), carets (^) or colons (:)"         )     elif any([c in ["?", "*", "["] for c in ref_path]):         raise ValueError(             f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot contain question marks (?), asterisks (*) or open brackets ([)"         )     elif ref_path.startswith("/") or ref_path.endswith("/") or "//" in ref_path:         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot start or end with '/', or contain '//")     elif ref_path.endswith("."):         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot end with '.'")     elif "@{" in ref_path:         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot contain '@{{'")     elif ref_path == "@":         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot be '@'")     elif "\\" in ref_path:         raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref_path}': references cannot contain '\\'") ```  The naive approach is IMO more readable, but around half as fast as the one in the PR. Although, for reference, in my MacBook M1 Pro, for a refname 25 characters long:   * Time to validate using approach in PR: `2.48us` * Time to validate using naive approach: `4.69us`   So we are talking about minimal amounts either way. I'll leave the choice of which algorithm to use up to the maintainers. |

Thanks a million, I love this implementation!

Strangely enough, I find the faster version (the one here) more readable as well and would want to keep it for that reason alone.

There is one issue I see that might be hard to solve, but it's time to at least try. It's the general problem of how to interact with paths without running into decoding problems (i.e. Python tries to decode a path as decoding X, and fails, even though it's a valid filesystem path). Maybe [@EliahKagan](https://github.com/EliahKagan) also has ideas regarding this topic.

Is there a way to avoid converting to `str`? I assume this tries to decode `ref_path` with the current string encoding, which changes depending on the interpreter or user configuration and generally causes a lot of trouble.

Unless this PR worsens that problem in some way, which I believe it does not, I would recommend it be fixed separately and later. The code this is replacing already had:

| --- | --- |
|  | raise ValueError(f"Invalid reference '{ref\_path}'") |

But actually even that neither introduced nor exacerbated the problem. From the commit prior to [#1644](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1644) being merged:

Note how `str(ref_path)` was passed to `os.path.join`, which when given `str`s returns a `str`, thus a `str` was being passed to `open`. Note also that, while this `str` call was actually redundant ([`os.path.join`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join) accepts [path-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object) since Python 3.6), even *it* was not the cause of `str` and not `bytes` being used. The annotation on `ref_path` is `Union[PathLike, None]`, where `PathLike` is:

[GitPython/git/types.py](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/830025bbfabc079ff803491920c2453dee4ce24f/git/types.py#L43)

Line 43

|  | PathLike = Union[str, "os.PathLike[str]"] |
| --- | --- |

Where both alternatives--`str` and `os.PathLike[str]`--represent text that has already been decoded.

So unless I'm missing something--which I admit I could be--I don't think it makes conceptual sense to do anything about that in this pull request. Furthermore, unless the judgment that [CVE-2023-41040](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c "CVE-2023-41040") was a security vulnerability was mistaken, or something about the variation explicated in [#1644 (comment)](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1644#issuecomment-1726331886) is less exploitable, it seems to me that this pull request is fixing a vulnerability. Assuming that is the case, then I think this should avoid attempting to make far-reaching changes beyond those that pertain to the vulnerability, and that although reviewing these changes for correctness *should **not** be rushed*, other kinds of delays should be mostly avoided. With good regression tests included, as seems to be the case, the code could be improved on later in other ways.

Thanks a lot for the thorough assessment, I wholeheartedly agree.

The 'how to handle paths correctly' issue is definitely one of the big breaking points in GitPython, but maybe, for other reasons, this wasn't ever a problem here.

Knowing this is on your radar, maybe one day there will be a solution to it. `gitoxide` already solves this problem, but it's easier when you have an actual type system and a standard library that makes you aware every step of the way.

Is the ultimate goal to support both `str`-based and `bytes`-based ref names and paths?

The goal is correctness, and it's vital that one doesn't try to decode paths to fit some interpreter-controlled encoding. Paths are paths, and if you are lucky, they can be turned into bytes. On Unix, that's always possible and a no-op, but on windows it may require a conversion. It's just the question how these things are supposed to work in python.

Does this relate (conceptually, I mean) to the issue in [rust-lang/rust#12056](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/12056)?

A great find :) - yes, that's absolutely related. `gitoxide` internally handles git-paths as bundles of bytes without known encoding, and just like `git`, it assumes at least ASCII. Conversions do happen but they all go through [`gix-path`](https://docs.rs/gix-path/0.10.0/gix_path/) to have a central place for it.

Doing something like it would be needed here as well, even though I argue that before that happens universally, there should be some clear definition of what GitPython is supposed to be.

When I took it over by contributing massively, just like you do now, I needed more control for the use-case I had in mind, and started implementing all these sloppy pure-python components that don't even get the basics right. With that I turned GitPython into some strange hybrid which I think didn't do it any good besides maybe being a little faster for *some* usecases. After all, manipulating an index in memory has advantages, but there are also other ways to do it while relying on `git` entirely.

Maybe this is thinking a step too far, but I strongly believe that the true benefit of GitPython is to be able to call `git` in a simple manner and to be compliant naturally due to using `git` directly. This *should* be its identity.

But then again, it's worth recognizing that changing the various pure-python implementations to us `git` under the hood probably isn't possible in a non-breaking way.

Another avenue would be to try and get the APIs to use types that don't suffer from encoding/decoding issues related to Paths, and then one day make the jump to replacing the pure-python implementations with the python bindings of `gitoxide`.

| It looks like CI improved and now that the PR was merged, it failed CI due to a lint: <https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/actions/runs/6271134895/job/17030195508#step:4:122> . A quick fix will be appreciated.  Edit: I quickly fixed it myself - it seems like sometimes I forget that I am still able to edit text, despite it being python. |

| [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron) Because the forthcoming 3.1.37 release that will include this patch will be a security fix, either the existing advisory/CVE should be updated with a correction (both a note and the version change), or a new CVE should be created for the variant of the vulnerability reported at [#1644 (comment)](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1644#issuecomment-1726331886). I am not sure which of those things should be done here.  Usually I would lean toward regarding such things as new bugs meriting new advisories/CVEs, which is also what I see more often. But I do not know that that's the best approach here, because the variant of the exploit where an absolute (or otherwise non-relative) path is used does seem to match the description in the summary section of [CVE-2023-41040](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c "CVE-2023-41040") even though it doesn't resemble any of the examples. *To be clear, I don't mean that this situation is necessarily ambiguous, but instead that I do not have the knowledge and experience to know how it ought to be handled.* Either way, this need not delay the release, of course.  (Sorry if you're already on top of the CVE/advisory matter and this comment is just noise.) |

| Thanks for the hint, it's appreciated!  I think it's fair to say that I am not on top of CVEs and that I have no intention to be - even though this sounds harsh it's just the current reality. But thus far members of the community picked up the necessary work around CVEs which I definitely appreciate if this would keep happening. |

| Given the [3.1.37](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases/tag/3.1.37) release title ("3.1.37 - a proper fix [CVE-2023-41040](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c "CVE-2023-41040")") I'm thinking this is intuitively being regarded as fixing the originally reported vulnerability, so perhaps that advisory should be updated, rather than a new one created? I am still not sure.  As noted in [#1638 (comment)](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1638#issuecomment-1712658727), you ([@Byron](https://github.com/Byron)) could update the local advisory. If you do, a PR could then also be opened on <https://github.com/github/advisory-database> (where [github/advisory-database#2690](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2690) was opened) to change the global advisory accordingly. I don't know if there's anything else that would need to be done.  [@stsewd](https://github.com/stsewd) Do you have any opinion about what ought to be done here? Would you have any objection to the local advisory being edited this way? Would you instead prefer that this variant, where an absolute path is used, be regarded as a related but separate vulnerability altogether? (I know [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron) can edit the advisory, but I wanted to check in case you had an opinion on this.)  One source of my hesitancy here is that I think a new CVE may still be needed in this kind of situation. [That seems common](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=because+of+an+incomplete+fix+for) (courtesy of [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76536557/1038860)). |

I kindly ask somebody else to create a PR for the global database though - it seems GitHub makes it hard/impossible to the use web interface for that.  One source of my hesitancy here is that I think a new CVE may still be needed in this kind of situation.  To me, CVEs are good to create a far-reaching 'ping' to users of GitPython. Some might see it earlier than the new release. To me it's the question on how much time one wants to spend to create such a ping, and judging from the CVE's I have seen, it's quite expensive. |

| If there is an uproar because of how this was handled, it will be possible to undo changes to the local CVE and create a new one. So I think nothing is lost, and I think it's OK to chose less expensive options in dealing with this. |

| Hi, a new CVE/advisory is usually created for this type of situation, and in the description you can put something like "this was a due to an incomplete fix of [link to the other CVE]". I don't oppose to edit the current one, but I guess editing doesn't have the same "ping to everyone to upgrade" effect as a new one. |

| Hi, a new CVE/advisory is usually created for this type of situation, and in the description you can put something like "this was a due to an incomplete fix of [link to the other CVE]". I don't oppose to edit the current one, but I guess editing doesn't have the same "ping to everyone to upgrade" effect as a new one.  Thanks!  [@Byron](https://github.com/Byron) Based on this, and also what I am now seeing is the recent history of this practice being followed for GitPython in [CVE-2022-24439](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hcpj-qp55-gfph "CVE-2022-24439")/[CVE-2023-40267](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pr76-5cm5-w9cj "CVE-2023-40267"), I recommend making a new advisory. Maybe there is some way I can help with this?  However, if for any reason you would still prefer this route not be taken, then I can definitely go ahead and open a PR to update the global advisory with the version change. (I am unsure if that would cause Dependabot to notify users of the security update or not, but I imagine that, if it would not, then a reviewer on the PR would mention that.)  But thus far members of the community picked up the necessary work around CVEs which I definitely appreciate if this would keep happening.  I have three ideas of what I could do, but I don't know what, if any of them, would help or be wanted. This depends, in part, on [what takes up the time for you](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1672#issuecomment-1731007627).   1. If the issue is drafting the text of the advisory, I can write a draft and propose that, here, to you. (I considered doing that for this comment, but I figured it would be better to ask first.) You would still have to create the advisory and request the CVE in the same way as you did for [CVE-2023-41040](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cwvm-v4w8-q58c "CVE-2023-41040"). 2. If the issue is the process *after* that, then I might be able to actually request the CVE. Although GitHub is a [CNA](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs), I don't think they provide a way to request a CVE except by a maintainer and through the interface you have used. [MITRE](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/mitre) is a CNA and I've heard of non-maintainers requesting CVEs from them successfully. However, I am unsure if they would accept such a request from me, because I have no specific connection to this vulnerability (I did not discover, report, analyze, fix, or integrate a fix for it). In addition, if I make the request, then I would first want to ask you some questions about how a situation would arise where someone could exploit this vulnerability without otherwise already being able to open files outside the local repository's `.git` directory, to ensure that I would be able to stand fully by any statements I would make in the request and afterwards. Given that, I am unsure to what extent this option would save you effort. 3. Combination of *1* and *2*: I could draft a new advisory, and you could create and publish the new advisory based on my draft (with any modifications you deem appropriate) via the GitHub interface, but *not* request a CVE for it. Even at this point something would have been achieved, I believe, because *within* the GitHub ecosystem (e.g., for Dependabot), I think alerts would be generated once it makes its way into the GitHub Advisory Database. Then I could attempt to request a CVE from some CNA, which if/when assigned could be associated with the advisory. |

(I am unsure if that would cause Dependabot to notify users of the security update or not, but I imagine that, if it would not, then a reviewer on the PR would mention that.)  Let's try something: updating version numbers is much cheaper than creating a new 'follow-up' CVE, for all sides actually. One could ask in the PR of the version change if notifications will be sent, and if unknown, [@stsewd](https://github.com/stsewd) could probably help to tell as well.  If no notification is sent, you could create a new CVE - you would be able to [do this here in GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/new) and from there it can be elevated, along with requesting a global CVE for it - this is easily done through the maintainer interface. The rest we can take from there should it come to that. |

| Let's try something: updating version numbers is much cheaper than creating a new 'follow-up' CVE, for all sides actually.  Sounds good; I will do this.  I noticed in the local advisory that, while `3.1.37` is given for patched versions, `<=3.1.34` is still given for affected versions. I recommend changing that `<=3.1.34` here to `<=3.1.36` for consistency, and I'll specify `<=3.1.36` in my proposed change to the global advisory. But if that is no the case and you want that specified differently, please let me know and I'll do differently (or amend the PR if I have already made it).  One could ask in the PR of the version change if notifications will be sent  I'm making the PR through the structured "Suggest improvements" template, in which every field is pretty specific. I'll either include it somewhere if it fits, or otherwise try and add it into the created PR or add a comment with it.  If no notification is sent, you could create a new CVE - you would be able to [do this here in GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/new) and from there it can be elevated, along with requesting a global CVE for it - this is easily done through the maintainer interface. The rest we can take from there should it come to that.  Thanks for telling me about that. That is much nicer than the particular specific I had suggested might be used. Of course, I'll still save that for if the above proves insufficient, as you say. |

| Further update: The change to the global advisory *has* caused Dependabot security alerts to be raised, as desired. For example, [dmvassallo/EmbeddingScratchwork#248](https://github.com/dmvassallo/EmbeddingScratchwork/pull/248) is a PR opened automatically to resolve a new Dependabot security alert in a project where GitPython had already been upgraded to the previously listed version. Note that this does not necessarily apply for tools that are less closely coupled to the GitHub ecosystem, and I don't know, for example, if any new [Renovatebot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) PRs will be generated. |
