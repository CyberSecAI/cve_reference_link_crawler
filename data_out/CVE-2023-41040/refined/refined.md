    {
      "source": "github.com_a52a5a0a_20250110_130416.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because GitPython reads files from the `.git` directory to resolve git references. In certain code paths, the filename is provided by the user and is not validated to ensure it is within the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to supply a path to a file outside of the `.git` directory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Blind Local File Inclusion",
        "Improper input validation",
        "Path traversal"

      "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service by making GitPython read a large or infinite file, or use it to determine if a file exists. The content of the file itself is not directly exposed.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited through multiple code paths where the user provides the file path, including `r.commit()`, `r.tree()`, and `r.index.diff()`."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input that's used as a file path by GitPython, typically through a crafted git reference. The attacker must also have local access to the repository on the filesystem.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in `git/refs/symbolic.py`, specifically at lines 174-175. The code joins the base directory with a user-supplied string without verifying that the final path is within the base directory. This can lead to reading arbitrary files. The exploit is considered 'blind' because the content of the files is not directly revealed, but the vulnerability allows for actions like checking if a file exists or causing a denial of service (DoS) by reading a large file."
