- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, potentially leading to the execution of unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the name fields in policy audit logs. Specifically, the attacker injects malicious scripts into the 'name' fields, and those scripts are executed when an admin views the logs in FortiNAC's GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to modify the name fields in policy audit logs, which suggests the attacker may need to have some level of access or control over policy configurations or the environment that generates these logs. This vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker.
