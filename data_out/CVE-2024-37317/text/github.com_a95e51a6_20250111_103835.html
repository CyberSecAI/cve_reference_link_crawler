| This breaks the Notes app when the parent is a shared folder. The process goes:   * If selected folder is shared, create new folder. * Newly created folder is shared (since the parent is shared), so it may not be used -> create new folder.   On a fast system that syncs often, this just creates hundreds of new folders in minutes. This caused [#1266](https://github.com/nextcloud/notes/issues/1266) |
