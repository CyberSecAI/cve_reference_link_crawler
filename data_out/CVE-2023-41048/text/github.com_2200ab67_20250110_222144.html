# Stored Cross Site Scripting with SVG images

Low

[mauritsvanrees](/mauritsvanrees)
published
GHSA-jj7c-jrv4-c65x
Sep 21, 2023

## Package

pip

plone.namedfile
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=5.6.0, <=6.0.2, <=6.1.2, <=6.2.0

## Patched versions

5.6.1, 6.0.3, 6.1.3, 6.2.1

## Description

### Impact

There is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. A [security hotfix from 2021](https://github.com/plone/Products.PloneHotfix20210518) already partially fixed this, by making sure SVG images are always downloaded instead of shown inline. But the same problem still exists for scales of SVG images.

Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is not vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link.

All versions of `plone.namedfile` are impacted.

### Patches

Patches will be released in various `plone.namedfile` releases:

* 5.6.1 (for Plone 5.2)
* 6.0.3 (for Plone 6.0.0-6.0.4)
* 6.1.3 (for Plone 6.0.5-6.0.6)
* 6.2.1 (for Plone 6.0.7)

### Workarounds

There is no workaround.

This was independently reported to the [Plone Security Team](https://plone.org/security/report) by Miguel Segovia, Aldin Visnjic, and Faris Krivic.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
