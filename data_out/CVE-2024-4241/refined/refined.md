Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formQosManageDouble_auto` function within the Tenda W9 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `ssidIndex` parameter, received via a POST request, is used in a `sprintf` call. User-controlled input for `ssidIndex` is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to provide a value that exceeds the buffer size of `mib_prefix_wl2g`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful buffer overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS), arbitrary code execution, and potentially complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the router's web interface, where the attacker controls the value of the `ssidIndex` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable device, either via a local network connection or remotely if the device is exposed. No specific authentication is mentioned in the provided information, but the attacker may require access to the web interface or a related service.

**Technical Details:**

* The vulnerable code is: `sprintf(mib_prefix_wl2g, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);` where `index` is derived from the `ssidIndex` parameter.
* The `mib_prefix_wl2g` is a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
* The `ssidIndex` parameter from POST request is directly used to format a string into the `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Tenda W9 firmware version V1.0.0.7(4456).
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) is provided showing how to send the vulnerable POST request with a malicious payload.
*   The `sprintf` function does not perform any bounds checking, making it a common cause of buffer overflows if not used carefully.
