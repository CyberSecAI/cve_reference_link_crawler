  "CVE-2024-35830": {
    "Description": "The provided information indicates a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel media driver 'tc358743'. The fix delays the registration of the v4l2 async device until after successful setup of the device. The vulnerability lies in the premature registration of the v4l2 async device before the device is fully initialized. This can cause issues in userspace accessing the device.",
    "Root cause": "The v4l2 async device was registered before the associated hardware was fully initialized.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect device initialization sequence."
    ],
    "Impact": "Userspace applications might encounter errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access the device, if initialization fails after the device is exposed via v4l2.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the affected device node via v4l2 framework.",
   "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to interact with the V4L2 device interface after device probe, but before the device is fully initialized."
