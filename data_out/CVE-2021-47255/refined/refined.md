The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing guard in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) implementation for the Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (LAPIC). Specifically, the `kvm_lapic_reg_read` function lacked proper validation of register access, allowing reads that could potentially touch undefined bytes of an APIC register.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `kvm_lapic_reg_read` function didn't check if the requested access to an APIC register touched bytes 4 through 15, which are reserved and cause undefined behavior.
- **Information Leak:** Reading these reserved bytes could leak kernel stack contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Stack Information Leak:** An attacker could potentially read kernel stack contents, which might contain sensitive data.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Accessing undefined bytes of an APIC register, as stated by the SDM, can lead to undefined behavior and potential instability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a guest virtual machine attempting to read LAPIC registers with an invalid offset or length via the `kvm_lapic_reg_read` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger reads from the LAPIC.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges within the guest beyond what's required to perform LAPIC register accesses.

The provided patches restore a guard that was previously removed, adding checks within `kvm_lapic_reg_read` to validate the alignment and length of the requested read, preventing the illegal access to the reserved bytes and the subsequent stack information leak.
