Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-40801 (Placeholder - needs official CVE description)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow in the `sub_451784` function of the Tenda AC23 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `sub_451784` function does not validate the length of the `security_5g` parameter received from user input.
- **Unsafe String Copy:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `security_5g` parameter directly into a stack buffer without any bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stack Overflow:** A long `security_5g` input string overflows the stack buffer allocated for it, potentially overwriting other stack data.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With careful crafting of the overflow data, an attacker can potentially overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable process. The provided text mentions the possibility of obtaining a root shell after careful construction of the exploit.
- **Denial of Service:** The stack overflow can also cause the router's firmware to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiBasicSet` endpoint.
- **`security_5g` parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing an overly long string in the `security_5g` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. This likely means that they need to be on the same network as the router or have some form of access to the router's network interface.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoint (`/goform/WifiBasicSet`) and parameter (`security_5g`).

**Additional Details (Not in official CVE Description):**
- The vulnerable firmware version is explicitly identified as **Tenda AC23 V16.03.07.45\_cn**.
- The call chain of the vulnerable function is detailed as `formWifiBasicSet -> sub_451DF8 -> sub_451BB0 -> sub_451784`.
- A Proof of Concept (POC) HTTP request is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.

In summary, this document provides a good technical overview of a stack overflow vulnerability in Tenda AC23 router firmware, including the root cause, vulnerable code, attack vector, impact, and a working proof of concept.
