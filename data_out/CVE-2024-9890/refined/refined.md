Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **improper capability check** within the `switchUser` function of the User Toolkit plugin. This function is responsible for handling the user switching process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is an insufficient capability check before allowing a user to switch to another account.  Specifically, the plugin checks for `remove_users` or `manage_network_users` capabilities in the user row action, but not when the `switchUser` function is called which allows subscriber-level users to switch to any other user account.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling (Prior to Patch):** The plugin's prior versions used cookies to store the username in plain text which is considered PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Account Takeover:** An attacker with minimal privileges (Subscriber+) can log in as any other user, including an administrator, gaining full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Data Breach:** If coupled with other vulnerabilities, the attacker could potentially access sensitive data or modify site content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network (HTTP/HTTPS).
*   **Web Interface:** Exploitation occurs through the WordPress login interface using a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.
*   **Access to Site:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site's login page.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker must know that the site is using the vulnerable User Toolkit plugin, and be able to craft a specific URL to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within the `UserSwitch.php` file, specifically in the `switchUser` function.
*   The `switchUser` function fails to properly validate user permissions before setting the current user and authentication cookies which results in the user switch taking place.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by constructing a URL with the action set to `switch_user`, a valid `user_id` to switch to, and a `user_from` parameter set to the attackers own user ID, and the required `_wpnonce` parameter.

**Patch Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.4 by using more secure cookie handling, removing PII from cookies, adding the `SameSite` attribute and most importantly, properly validating the user switch process by using a transient containing the user ID's to switch between rather than relying on the `user_from` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that `CVE-2024-50503` may be a duplicate of this CVE.
