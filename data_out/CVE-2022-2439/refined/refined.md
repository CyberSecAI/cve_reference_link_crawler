Based on the provided information, this content is relevant to CVE-2022-2439.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the deserialization of untrusted data through the 'upload[file]' parameter. Specifically, the plugin doesn't properly sanitize the file path, allowing an attacker to use a PHAR wrapper to trigger the deserialization of arbitrary PHP objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data
- Insufficient file path sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution through the deserialization of malicious PHP objects.
- The attacker can perform various malicious actions if a suitable POP chain is present within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By exploiting the 'upload[file]' parameter with a crafted PHAR archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated administrative user access to the WordPress site.
