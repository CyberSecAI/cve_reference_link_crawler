Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The text format label was not properly sanitized in the hint displayed below the text editor when the current text format changes. This text was updated via JavaScript, and the lack of sanitization allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including script tags.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Due to improper sanitization of user-supplied text format names, it was possible to inject malicious scripts.
- Lack of output encoding/sanitization: The text format name was displayed without proper encoding, making it susceptible to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to create a new text format with malicious HTML/JavaScript within the name.
- When a user switches to this text format, the unsanitized name is rendered in the hint below the editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to create or edit text formats.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present on the `node/add` page.
- The text format label was correctly sanitized on the text formats page and in the select list on the node/add page.
- The fix involves sanitizing the text format name before displaying it in the hint below the text editor.
- The issue is described as not warranting a CVE because an administrator with the ability to configure text formats can already enable "Full HTML" and introduce arbitrary HTML/JS code.
