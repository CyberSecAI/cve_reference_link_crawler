[1.24.2](/backdrop/backdrop/tree/1.24.2)

[`6d7645e`](/backdrop/backdrop/commit/6d7645eff7549bbe4f2654e5a1620dd827a45569)

Security release for Backdrop CMS. This release fixes 1 security vulnerability:

* [Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Access bypass - BACKDROP-SA-CORE-2023-005](https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2023-005)

This release also includes a handful of bug fixes and other improvements.

**Notes for updating**

* This release **does modify** the `settings.php` file located outside the `core` directory. Updating your customized copy of this file is recommended, but not necessary. To update, copy the new section on`file_not_normalized_schemes` [from the latest file](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/blob/1.x/settings.php#L474) to your site's `settings.php` file.
* **It will be necessary to run the update script** (located at `/core/update.php`) for this release.

**Changes to site-owner-managed files**

Following this release, Backdrop will block access to private files at certain specially crafted paths. Previous versions of Backdrop allowed access to these paths, and in most cases blocking access is the correct behavior.

There may be some sites that rely on allowing access to these paths. It is also possible that the changes in this release may cause other problems with file access. Sites that experience problems with private files after this change should add the following line to `settings.php`:

```
$config['system.core']['file_not_normalized_schemes'] = array('private');`

```

This will preserve the old behavior for files saved in the private files directory, using the `private` stream wrapper from Backdrop core. Sites that need to preserve the old behavior for files using other stream wrappers, from contributed or custom modules, should list those stream wrappers instead of 'private'.

The comments in the default `settings.php` file have additional information.

Using this setting will bypass the access checks added in this release, which may allow public access to files that are meant to be private. This setting is a temporary backward-compatibility layer for misconfigured sites. It will be removed in a future release since it is insecure.

**Changes since version 1.24.1** are listed below.
