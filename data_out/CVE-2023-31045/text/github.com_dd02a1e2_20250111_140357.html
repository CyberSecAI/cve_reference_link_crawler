| Description of the bug The text format label is correctly sanitized on the text formats page, and in the select list on the `node/add` page, but in the hint below the text editor, it is not properly sanitized when the current text format changes. (In this scenario, the text is replaced by JavaScript). Steps To Reproduce To reproduce the behavior:   1. create a new text format named `test<script>alert('XSS');</script>` 2. Go to the `node/add/page` page 3. Change the text format to your new one  * Notice that in the select list the text is properly sanitized üëçüèº * Notice that in the text filter wrapper summary, it is not üëéüèº |

| I merged in [backdrop/backdrop#4406](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/pull/4406) into 1.x and 1.24.x. Thanks!  Note that this issue is public and does not receive a CVE because any administrator that can configure a text format could easily allow Full HTML anywhere. |
