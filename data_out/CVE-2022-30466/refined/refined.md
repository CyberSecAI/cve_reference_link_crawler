{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Joy ebike Wolf 2022 model uses a key fob to lock and unlock the scooter. The unlock/drive command sent by the key fob is vulnerable to replay attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper authentication or replay protection for the unlock/drive command.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can unlock and drive the ebike by replaying a previously captured unlock/drive command.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uses a Hackrf device to sniff the radio frequency communication between the key fob and the ebike, capturing the unlock/drive command, and then replaying the command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within radio range of the key fob and ebike when the unlock command is initially sent to capture the command. The attacker also needs a Hackrf with an antenna or similar device capable of capturing and replaying radio frequency signals."
