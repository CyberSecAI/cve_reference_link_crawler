Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-6060:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `main` function of `jstest_main.c`. Specifically, when processing a crafted input file, the code copies a long string into a fixed-size buffer named `path` on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `path` buffer is allocated on the stack with a fixed size of 1024, while the `strcpy` function used to copy data into it does not check for buffer bounds. A specially crafted input file can cause the copied data to exceed the buffer's capacity, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The stack buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, causing the application to crash.
- There is also the potential for "unspecified impact". While not explicitly stated, stack-based buffer overflows can be exploited for arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted input file that is processed by `mujstest`, a scriptable tester for mupdf + js. An attacker can entice a user to process this file, triggering the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a crafted file to be processed by the `mujstest` application. This could be through a file system, web server, or other means of file delivery.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or system access, other than being able to execute the `mujstest` program.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Agostino Sarubbo of Gentoo using Address Sanitizer (ASan).
- The vulnerability was present in MuPDF version 1.10a.
- The issue was fixed by ensuring that the `path` and `line` buffers have equal size and are large enough to prevent overflow.
- There was an initial incorrect patch that resolved another issue, but masked the stack buffer overflow issue.
- The fix was applied in commit `06a012a42c9884e3cd653e7826cff1ddec04eb6e`, which was followed by another commit `e089b2e2c1d38c5696c7dfd741e21f8f3ef22b14` that performed some related cleanup.
- The vulnerability was reported to upstream on 2017-02-05.
- Gentoo released GLSA 201706-08 to address this and other MuPDF vulnerabilities, indicating a severity of "normal" and remote exploitability.
- Debian LTS advisory DLA-2765-1 also mentions CVE-2017-6060 and indicates it was fixed in mupdf version 1.14.0+ds1-4+deb9u1.
