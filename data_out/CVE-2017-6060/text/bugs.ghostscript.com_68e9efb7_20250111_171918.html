| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo    2017-02-05 12:53:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13355](attachment.cgi?id=13355 "stacktrace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=13355&action=edit "stacktrace") stacktrace  Tested on: 1.10a  To reproduce: # mujstest $FILE  Reproducer: <https://github.com/asarubbo/poc/blob/master/00147-mupdf-mujstest-stackoverflow-main> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c1)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2017-04-08 19:58:35 UTC  ``` This was resolved in [cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c2)  Agostino Sarubbo    2017-04-10 07:35:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sebastian Rasmussen from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c1)) > This was resolved in [cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06).  No, this patch fixed the strcpy-param-overlap issue, but introduced the stack buffer overflow issue. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c3)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2017-04-10 20:13:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to Agostino Sarubbo from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c2)) > (In reply to Sebastian Rasmussen from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c1)) > > This was resolved in [cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?cfe8f35bca61056363368c343be36812abde0a06). >  > No, this patch fixed the strcpy-param-overlap issue, but introduced the > stack buffer overflow issue.  That's not entirely true. The stack buffer overflow was being masked by the issue my patch resolved. I did run your file successfully without issues in both valgrind and gdb before setting this bug as resolved. Prompted by your reponse I figured out how to run asan using gcc and was finally able to see the problem you mentioned.  I have a tentative fix here (which may or may not go into 1.11): <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=user/sebras/mupdf.git;a=commit;h=06a012a42c9884e3cd653e7826cff1ddec04eb6e>  As well as a related cleanup here: <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=user/sebras/mupdf.git;a=commit;h=e089b2e2c1d38c5696c7dfd741e21f8f3ef22b14> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo    2017-04-29 06:42:07 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerComparisonOfMemoryTools>  Valgrind does not report the stack buffer overflow, this is the reason because you didn't see the bug when you made a patch for the strcpy-param-overlap issue. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=697551#c5)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2017-04-29 09:32:37 UTC  ``` As I anticipated the fixes [06a012a42c9884e3cd653e7826cff1ddec04eb6e](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?06a012a42c9884e3cd653e7826cff1ddec04eb6e) and [e089b2e2c1d38c5696c7dfd741e21f8f3ef22b14](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?e089b2e2c1d38c5696c7dfd741e21f8f3ef22b14) never made it into 1.11, but is on master now and will be in the next release. ``` |  |
