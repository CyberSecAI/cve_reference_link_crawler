**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6557

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the SchedulePress plugin including a demo file from the wpdeveloper library with `display_errors` enabled. This configuration flaw leads to the disclosure of the web application's full path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the server's full file path due to improperly configured error handling. This is a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Unnecessary Demo Files:** The inclusion of a demo file within the plugin's package that should have been removed in production.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The main impact is the disclosure of the full path to the web application.
- **Aid to Further Attacks:**  While not immediately critical, the disclosed path can be used by attackers to better understand the system's structure and potentially leverage other vulnerabilities more effectively. The impact is described as "not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning no prior access or credentials are required.
- **Direct Access to Vulnerable File:** The attacker needs to access the specific demo file that exposes the path information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
