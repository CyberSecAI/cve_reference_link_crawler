Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenMetadata's `JwtFilter` handles request paths when determining if authentication is required. The filter checks if the request path contains any of the endpoints listed in `EXCLUDED_ENDPOINTS`. If a match is found, the filter bypasses JWT validation. Attackers can exploit this by injecting path parameters (e.g., `;v1%2fusers%2flogin`) into the request path to trick the filter into believing the request is for an excluded endpoint, thereby skipping authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass authentication checks due to path parameter manipulation.
*   **Path Parameter Injection:** The application does not properly handle or sanitize path parameters, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary strings into the request path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access any API endpoint without proper authentication.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary code using a SpEL expression injection via an unauthenticated endpoint which can be reached by exploiting the authentication bypass.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the OpenMetadata server.
*   **Path Parameter Manipulation:**  Attackers inject path parameters into the request URL to trigger the bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenMetadata server.
*   **HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP requests with specific path parameters.
