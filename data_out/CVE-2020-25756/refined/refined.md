The content is related to CVE-2020-25756.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mg_get_http_header` function in `mongoose/src/mg_http.c` due to a missing bounds check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `mg_get_http_header` function iterates through HTTP headers, storing names and values in `header_names` and `header_values` arrays, respectively. These arrays have a size bound by `MG_MAX_HTTP_HEADERS`. However, the loop lacked a check to ensure it doesn't exceed this bound.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A maliciously crafted HTTP header with excessive headers could cause a buffer overflow when processed by the `mg_get_http_header` function, leading to potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with a large number of headers exceeding the `MG_MAX_HTTP_HEADERS` limit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server running the Mongoose library.
