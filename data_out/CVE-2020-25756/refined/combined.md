| A buffer overflow error in mg\_get\_http\_header function in mongoose/src/mg\_http.c in Mongoose 6.18, where header\_names and header\_values have a bound of (MG\_MAX\_HTTP\_HEADERS); however, there is no check to ensure that the loop does not exceed the upper bound. A Maliciously crafted http header can trigger this bug. To fix it, modify the loop condition into:  for (i = 0;i < MG\_MAX\_HTTP\_HEADERS && hm->header\_names[i].len > 0 ; i++) |

| actually, this will not happen in practice because mg\_http\_parse\_headers will not populate the last slot:   [mongoose/src/mg\_http.c](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/blob/86f391c70158a0ee553746e326bc996a3a39b4c0/src/mg_http.c#L408)  Line 408 in [86f391c](/cesanta/mongoose/commit/86f391c70158a0ee553746e326bc996a3a39b4c0)   |  | while (i < (int) ARRAY\_SIZE(req->header\_names) - 1) { | | --- | --- |      but it's good to have a range limit too. |

| Thank you, rojer, for your response. This bug has been detected using a static analysis tool that is part of a research study. Hence, your input is very important. Actually, the static analysis tool was run with an older version of mongoose, which was used with an Android app (AdAway); at that version, mg\_get\_http\_header is defined in mongoose.c. I just realized that mg\_get\_http\_header is still defined in mongoose.c with the newest version (I thought the definition was moved to a new file). I see that mg\_get\_http\_header that is defined in mongoose.c has been fixed, which is great. Also, I see that mg\_get\_http\_header has been called 22 times in mongoose.c file. Hence, there are many execution paths, so some might trigger the error. |

| [@BushraAloraini](https://github.com/BushraAloraini) so you ran an analysis tool that spotted a false positive, and logged a <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25756> ? I guess the assignment was to log a CVE report. What static analysis tool was that? |
