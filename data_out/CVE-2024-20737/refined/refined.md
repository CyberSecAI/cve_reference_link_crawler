Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read. This weakness allows attackers to potentially access sensitive information in memory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory leak. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to leak potentially sensitive information from the application's memory space. This could have further implications, though the current description is limited to a memory leak.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the machine where the software is running.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a user-level account (PR:N) on the target system and needs to trigger a user-interaction (UI:R) in the software. No special privileges are required.

**Summary of the CVE-2024-20737 vulnerability:**

This vulnerability in Adobe After Effects stems from an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to a memory leak. An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability if a user is tricked into interacting with a malicious file. The impact is currently only defined as a memory leak, however, leaked memory could contain sensitive information.
