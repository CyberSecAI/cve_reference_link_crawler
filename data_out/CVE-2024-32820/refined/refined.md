- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a broken access control issue, meaning it lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that they are not authorized to, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data or settings. The specific impact will depend on the actions that the unprivileged user can trigger.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be unauthenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
