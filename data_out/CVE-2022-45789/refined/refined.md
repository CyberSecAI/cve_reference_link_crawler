- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A capture-replay vulnerability allows the execution of unauthorized Modbus functions when an authenticated Modbus session is hijacked.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the PLC, which could result in denial of service and loss of confidentiality and integrity of the controller.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based, specifically Modbus communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to capture a legitimate Modbus session and then replay it to execute unauthorized functions. No authentication is necessary once the session is hijacked.
