EcoStruxure™ Control Expert, EcoStruxure™ Process Expert and
Modicon M340, M580 and M580 CPU Safety

10 January 2023 (13 August 2024)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its EcoStruxure™ Control Expert,
EcoStruxure™ Process Expert, Modicon M340, M580 and M580 CPU Safety.

The Modicon M580 are PAC and Safety PLCs with built-in Ethernet for process, high availability
& safety solutions.

The Modicon M340 offers compactness, flexibility, scalability, and robustness for the process
industry and a wide range of demanding automation applications.

EcoStruxure™ Control Expert is the common programming, debugging and operating software
for Modicon PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and PACs (Programmable Automation
Controllers).

The EcoStruxure™ Process Expert DCS is a single automation system to engineer, operate,
and maintain your entire infrastructure for a sustainable, productive and market-agile plant.

Failure to apply the mitigations provided below may risk unauthorized access to your PLC,
which could result in the possibility of denial of service and loss of confidentiality, integrity of the
controller.

August 2024 Update: A remediation is available on Modicon M580 CPU Safety (page 2).

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
