Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the file manager's bulk transfer functionality, where job IDs used to track file upload operations can be manipulated.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The system uses predictable or manipulable job IDs to track file uploads.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can hijack the file upload process and upload malicious files under the guise of a legitimate user, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the system.

Attack vectors:
Network-based attack through crafted POST requests.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and possess or be able to obtain a valid job ID associated with a file upload process initiated by a legitimate user. They also need to be able to craft HTTP POST requests. The attack complexity is high due to requiring a valid job ID. User interaction is required by the legitimate user to initiate a file upload process.
