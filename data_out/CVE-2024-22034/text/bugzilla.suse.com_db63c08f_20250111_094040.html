| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1225911#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2024-06-04 09:58:22 UTC  ``` found by Daniel Mach.  Attackers could put the special files in .osc into the actual package sources,  like e.g. _apiurl and so overwrite the _apiurl in the .osc directory.  There are more special _files in this .osc directory which could be overwritten.  Daniel Mach is looking into it. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1225911#c2)  Daniel Mach   2024-06-25 19:01:05 UTC  ``` I tried the mitigation: error out on files that would conflict with osc internal files. It was quite simple, but I wasn't convinced that it covers all possible scenarios, because it relied on enumerating all osc internal files.  I ended up writing a proper patch that puts all source files into a subdirectory and removes the root cause completely.  The following patches are already merged upstream and are prerequisites of the fix:  - <https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/pull/1585> - <https://github.com/openSUSE/osc/pull/1586>  My preference is to fix SLE and Tumbleweed by releasing a new osc version from upstream. Both versions are relatively close to the master branch. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1225911#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2024-07-11 13:42:10 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2024-22034 for this ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1225911#c5)  Thomas Leroy   2024-07-11 13:44:11 UTC  ``` All SLE codestreams look affected: - SUSE:SLE-12:Update - SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:Update - SUSE:SLE-15-SP4:Update - SUSE:SLE-15:Update ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1225911#c25)  Maintenance Automation   2024-08-19 16:30:21 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2024:2963-1: An update that solves one vulnerability can now be installed.
