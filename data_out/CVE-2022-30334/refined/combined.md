## Description

![@fmarier](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167821?u=836283846d232d3d0be00ac58f9e0025d7a35335&v=4&size=48)[fmarier](https://github.com/fmarier)opened [on Sep 13, 2021](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/18071#issue-995442549)

If a cross-origin request originates from a `.onion` service, we should match the Tor Browser behavior and:

* omit the `Referer` header
* send a value of `null` for the `Origin` header whenever present (e.g. in the case of a `POST` request)

Same-origin requests should follow [our normal referrer policy](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-Chromium-%28features-we-disable-or-remove%29#modified-features-and-functionality).

| The extra patches are unfortunate, but I could not find a way to get our existing hooks to cover all of the test cases in my test page.  Note that I am planning to upstream (at least) the referrer patch into the [Referrer Policy spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/) and then Chromium, given that the `.onion` scheme has been formally described in [RFC 7686](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7686/). |

why don't we do this in `MaybeChangeReferrer` in `brave_shields_util.cc`?

Because it doesn't cover all cases,sadly. That was my first attempt, but none of our existing hooks were even called in the case of a redirected CORS request for example (test case [#6](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/6) on my test page).

Changing this function also takes care of the `Origin` header in most cases (though not the CORS ones).

Sorry, something went wrong.

if it doesn't cover all cases, do we have a problem with the referrer capping that we do in MaybeChangeReferrer?..
