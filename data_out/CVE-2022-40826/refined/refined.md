Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The issue stems from the CodeIgniter framework's database functions `_wh()`, `_where_in()`, and `_like()` not sanitizing or filtering user-supplied input when used as database field names/column identifiers in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** If a developer uses user-controlled input directly in the field parameter of these functions, it can lead to SQL injection. This is because the input is not properly escaped or validated.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The framework does not automatically sanitize or validate user input when it is used to specify database fields in queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can craft malicious input to manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches by accessing sensitive information.
    *   Data modification, deletion, or corruption.
    *   Authentication bypass by manipulating the query to return unintended results
    *   Complete control of the database

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly validated before being used as a database field name in database functions. This could be via GET or POST parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate input that is later used in the application as a database column name within the vulnerable database functions.
*   The attacker would need knowledge of the application's structure and use of the vulnerable database functions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not in the framework's query builder itself, but rather in how the framework handles user input for database field names.
*   The issue highlights the importance of proper input validation, especially when interacting with databases. Developers must validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.
*   A related authentication bypass vulnerability was noted in a video (although based on CI4 instead of CI3) which appears to be caused by the same root cause.
