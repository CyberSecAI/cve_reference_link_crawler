The provided content discusses a path traversal vulnerability affecting multiple Flask applications. The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join` with user-controlled input, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Root Cause:**

- The `flask.send_file` function is used with a `filename` parameter that is derived from user-controlled input without proper sanitization.
- The `os.path.join` function, when used with an absolute path as the second parameter, discards the first parameter, allowing path traversal if the second parameter is attacker-controlled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
- **Unsafe Use of `flask.send_file`:** The function directly uses user-provided input as the filename without proper validation.
- **Unsafe Use of `os.path.join`:**  The function is used to construct file paths using user controlled input without validating that the path is not absolute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can access sensitive files outside the intended web root folder including application source code, configuration files, and system files.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Accessing files containing sensitive information like passwords, login credentials.
- **Partial Denial of Service:** Repeated requests for large files could cause a partial denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate HTTP requests by including path traversal sequences like `../` or absolute file paths in the `filename` or `path` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send malicious requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  Attackers need to identify the vulnerable parameters that are used with `send_file` or `os.path.join`.

**Example vulnerable code:**
```python
# Vulnerable code example using flask.send_file
@app.route('/download/<path:filename>')
def download_file(filename):
    return send_file(filename)


# Vulnerable code example using os.path.join
@app.route('/js/<path:path>')
def serve_js(path):
    static_dir = 'path/to/mySafeStaticDir'
    file_path = os.path.join(static_dir, path)
    return send_file(file_path)
```

**Remediation:**

- Use `flask.safe_join` to combine the base directory with the user provided path.
- Use `flask.send_from_directory` function instead of `flask.send_file`
- Prevent user-controlled data from reaching the vulnerable `send_file` function.
- Properly validate user inputs for paths to prevent traversal.
