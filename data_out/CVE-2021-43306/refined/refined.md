- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An exponential Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `url2` method of the jquery-validation npm package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by an inefficient regular expression used in the `url2` method, which can lead to exponential backtracking when processing crafted input strings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can cause a denial of service (DoS) by consuming excessive server resources, making the affected application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by supplying a malicious input string to the `url2` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to control input to the `url2` method, typically through user-supplied data such as in a web application form.
