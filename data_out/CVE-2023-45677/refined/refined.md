    "attack_vectors": "A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in `f->vendor[len] = (char)'\\0';` within the `start_decoder` function of the `stb_vorbis` library. This occurs when `len` is a large value that causes an integer overflow during the memory allocation process, leading to an insufficient allocation size and a subsequent heap buffer overflow when writing the null terminator.",
