**CVE-2023-38301 is UNRELATED**

The provided document discusses a wide array of vulnerabilities found in pre-installed software on Android carrier devices but does not include CVE-2023-38301.

**Vulnerabilities Discussed (excluding CVE-2023-38301):**

1.  **Non-Resettable IDs Leak to System Properties:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Pre-installed apps expose sensitive device identifiers (IMEI, MAC addresses, Serial Number, ICCID) to system properties.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Improper access control; system properties are easily readable by apps without special permissions.
    *   **Impact:**  Tracking and identification of devices.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app reads system properties using `getprop`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Any app installed on the device can read system properties.

2.  **MediaTek `mnld` Exposing GPS Coordinates (CVE-2023-20726):**
    *   **Root Cause:** `mnld` process exposes GPS coordinates to a local TCP port (7000).
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Unprotected local socket; lack of proper access control.
    *   **Impact:** Location tracking of the device.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Local app connects to TCP port 7000 to receive GPS coordinates.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app requires INTERNET permission.

3.  **MMIGroup App Vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-38297):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecurely exposed functionality in `MMIGroup` app, allowing other apps to trigger sensitive operations through Intents.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of proper permission checks; dynamic registration of a receiver that handles actions without verification; usage of system properties to pass data between apps.
    *   **Impact:**  Factory reset, IMEI/Serial number leak, arbitrary AT command execution, enabling wireless adapters.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app sends crafted Intents to the `MMIGroup` app's receiver.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Local app with no special permissions.

4. **Tracfone HiddenMenu App (CVE-2023-38293):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure AT command execution through the `HiddenMenu` app
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input validation; uses backspace characters to remove prefixes and inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary AT command execution
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app sends crafted intent to the HiddenMenu app
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app with no special permissions.

5. **TCL HiddenMenu App (CVE-2023-38292):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Insecurely exposed factory reset functionality through the `HiddenMenuproxy` app.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control on the broadcast receiver
    *   **Impact:**  Programmatic factory reset
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Local app sends a crafted Intent to the broadcast receiver
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app with no special permissions.

6.  **TCL TctScreenRecorder App (CVE-2023-38295):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Missing permission allows a malicious app to declare the missing permission and use it to trigger file read/write operations.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Missing permission check; improper use of Messenger objects; file operations via `ParcelFileDescriptor`.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary file read/write as the system user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app declares a missing permission and interacts with the service.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app can declare and request a permission named `com.tct.smart.switchphone.permission.SWITCH_DATA`.

7.  **Evenwell FQC App (CVE-2023-38290):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Local arbitrary command execution as system user through the `FQC` app.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper input validation, improper usage of system properties and foreground activities
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution with system user privileges.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app exploits a crash in `FQCBroadcastReceiver` and sends a crafted intent to `FQCService` with a command to execute in the `TurnOffHeater` extra.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app with no permissions.

8. **Transsion Factory App (CVE-2023-38294):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure command execution due to exposed functionality of the `Factory` app.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper access controls on file paths; execution of shell scripts using Intents.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary command execution as system user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local app creates shell scripts and a run command file, then sends a crafted intent to `CommandReceiver`
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local app with no special permissions.

9. **ZTE Vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-39071, CVE-2022-39074, CVE-2022-39075):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of zip files, intent parameters, and recursive directory deletion.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Path traversal in zip file, lack of checks on intent parameters, no recursion limit for directory deletion.
    *   **Impact:** File overwriting as system user, starting arbitrary activities, recursive directory deletion
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted zip files, crafted intents, and specific package name criteria
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Local app with no special permissions.

**General Themes:**

*   **Pre-installed Software Risks:** Pre-installed apps, often running with elevated privileges, are prime targets for exploitation.
*   **Improper Access Control:** Many vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing low-privilege apps to interact with privileged components.
*   **Intent-Based Exploitation:** The Android Intent system, designed for inter-process communication, is frequently misused as an attack vector.
*   **Vendor Customization Issues:** Vendor customizations and pre-installed apps are often the source of security vulnerabilities.
*   **Reliance on System Properties:** System properties are often used for inter-app communication and this can be a source of information leakage.
*   **Missing Permissions:** Missing permissions can be abused by malicious apps to gain access to protected components.

**Overall Impact:**

The vulnerabilities described can lead to a variety of attacks, including:

*   Device tracking
*   Data theft (IMEI, location, etc.)
*   Arbitrary code execution
*   Factory resets (data wipes)
*   Denial of service

**Recommendations:**

*   Vendors should proactively scan devices for vulnerabilities and implement security best practices.
*   Enterprises should monitor devices for security compliance.
*   Users should disable unnecessary or vulnerable pre-installed apps where possible.
