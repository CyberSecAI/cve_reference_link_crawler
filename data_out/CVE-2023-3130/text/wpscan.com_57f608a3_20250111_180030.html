## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Short URL < 1.6.5 - Admin+ Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin settings, add the POC <script>alert(1)</script> to the "External URL" or "Comments" fields and reload to see XSS.
Note: This must be tested on WordPress v5.8.7
