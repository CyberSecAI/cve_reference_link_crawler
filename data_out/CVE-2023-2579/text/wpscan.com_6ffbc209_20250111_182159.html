## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# InventoryPress <= 1.7 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow users with the role of author and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a "New Inventory Item"
2. In the "Description" field, add the value `"><script>alert("xss")</script>`
3. Edit the created item and see the XSS.
