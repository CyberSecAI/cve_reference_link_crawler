Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `text` parameter in the `add_new_invoice.php` script when retrieving medicine lists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. User-supplied input via the `text` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without being sanitized, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information within the database, such as medicine inventory details.
- **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Exploitation can allow manipulation or deletion of records.
- **Compromised System Availability and Integrity:** The vulnerability compromises both the availability and integrity of the system.
- **Potential Data Breaches:** Sensitive data exposure could result in data breaches.
- **Disruption of Operations:** Pharmaceutical operations could be disrupted due to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted GET requests targeting the `/php/add_new_invoice.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious SQL commands into the `text` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads that achieve the desired level of access and manipulation.
- **No authentication required:** It does not appear that an attacker needs to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function.
- The vulnerability is rated as **CRITICAL**.
- The affected system is **Pharmacy Management System version 1.0.**
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/php/add_new_invoice.php?action=medicine_list&text=aa`.
- The vulnerability is unpatched.
