| This has been reported in email and accepted as a PUBLIC track security issue. Go version go version go1.22.2 linux/amd64 Output of `go env` in your module/workspace: ``` GO111MODULE='' GOARCH='amd64' GOBIN='' GOCACHE='/root/.cache/go-build' GOENV='/root/.config/go/env' GOEXE='' GOEXPERIMENT='' GOFLAGS='' GOHOSTARCH='amd64' GOHOSTOS='linux' GOINSECURE='' GOMODCACHE='/go/pkg/mod' GONOPROXY='' GONOSUMDB='' GOOS='linux' GOPATH='/go' GOPRIVATE='' GOPROXY='https://proxy.golang.org,direct' GOROOT='/usr/local/go' GOSUMDB='sum.golang.org' GOTMPDIR='' GOTOOLCHAIN='local' GOTOOLDIR='/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_amd64' GOVCS='' GOVERSION='go1.22.2' GCCGO='gccgo' GOAMD64='v1' AR='ar' CC='gcc' CXX='g++' CGO_ENABLED='0' GOMOD='/dev/null' GOWORK='' CGO_CFLAGS='-O2 -g' CGO_CPPFLAGS='' CGO_CXXFLAGS='-O2 -g' CGO_FFLAGS='-O2 -g' CGO_LDFLAGS='-O2 -g' PKG_CONFIG='pkg-config' GOGCCFLAGS='-fPIC -m64 -fno-caret-diagnostics -Qunused-arguments -Wl,--no-gc-sections -fmessage-length=0 -ffile-prefix-map=/tmp/go-build216392132=/tmp/go-build -gno-record-gcc-switches' ``` What did you do? Use `archive/zip` (actually, a thin wrapper library <https://github.com/evilsocket/islazy/blob/master/zip/unzip.go>) to extract the attached ZIP archive: [poc.zip](https://github.com/golang/go/files/15005339/poc.zip) (Warning: It contains malware. Do not open the extracted exe file!)  It is constructed as illustrated below:  ``` normal ZIP archive with a virus      LFH           ─╮     data (virus)   ├─→──┐     CDH            │    │     EOCDR         ─╯    │ copy the inner                         ↓ archive with virus the final ZIP archive   │ as the data of                         │ the outer archive     LFH (size set to 1) │     data (copied) ←─────┘     CDH (size set to 1)     EOCDR (comment length set to 1 with empty comment content)  ``` What did you see happen? It can get the malware inside the ZIP archive. This is caused by the following logic, which skips EOCDR with a bogus comment length field and continues to search for the next one:     [go/src/archive/zip/reader.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c51f6c62576ab3088a981b9cef90e413ac99e333/src/archive/zip/reader.go#L702-L704)  Lines 702 to 704 in [c51f6c6](/golang/go/commit/c51f6c62576ab3088a981b9cef90e413ac99e333)   |  | if n+directoryEndLen+i <= len(b) { | | --- | --- | |  | return i | |  | } |      However, this is inconsistent with most other ZIP implementations, so they are using different EOCDRs and get different files extracted. Most other ZIP implementations are not able to get the virus. The PoC file is flagged by only 1/62 security vendor [on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0415361a15eda041bd344627f7c9a59a98c165318137cc028ee04b2178b45aa9).  This inconsistency can also be used in other scenarios depending on the specific use case of the package, such as [hiding add-on files from linter and reviewers](https://www.bamsoftware.com/sec/mozilla/#1534483). What did you expect to see? `archive/zip` should return an error when a bogus EOCDR is encountered. |

When scanning for an end of central directory record,
treat an EOCDR signature with a record containing a truncated
comment as an error. Previously, we would skip over the invalid
record and look for another one. Other implementations do not
do this (they either consider this a hard error, or just ignore
the truncated comment). This parser misalignment allowed
presenting entirely different archive contents to Go programs
and other zip decoders.
