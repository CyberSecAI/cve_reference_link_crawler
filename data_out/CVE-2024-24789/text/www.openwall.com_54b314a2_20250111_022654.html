Subject: Go 1.22.4 and Go 1.21.11 released with 2 security fixes
 (CVE-2024-24789, CVE-2024-24790)

<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/XbxouI9gY7k> announces:

> Hello gophers,
>
> We have just released Go versions 1.22.4 and 1.21.11, minor point releases.
>
> These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the security policy:
>
>   - archive/zip: mishandling of corrupt central directory record
>
>     The archive/zip package's handling of certain types of invalid zip
>     files differed from the behavior of most zip implementations. This
>     misalignment could be exploited to create an zip file with
>     contents that vary depending on the implementation reading the
>     file. The archive/zip package now rejects files containing these
>     errors.
>
>     Thanks to Yufan You (@ouuan) for reporting this issue.
>
>     This is CVE-2024-24789 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/66869>.
>
>   - net/netip: unexpected behavior from Is methods for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
>
>     The various Is methods (IsPrivate, IsLoopback, etc) did not work as expected
>     for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, returning false for addresses which would
>     return true in their traditional IPv4 forms.
>
>     Thanks to Enze Wang of Alioth (@zer0yu) and Jianjun Chen of Zhongguancun Lab
>     (@chenjj) for reporting this issue.
>
>     This is CVE-2024-24790 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/67680>.
