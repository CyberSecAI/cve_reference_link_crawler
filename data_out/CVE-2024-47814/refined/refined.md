  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to incorrect reference counting when closing a buffer and reopening it in a new split window via a BufWinLeave autocommand.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use After Free (CWE-416)"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash can occur due to a use-after-free when a buffer is closed and then immediately reopened in a new window by a BufWinLeave autocommand, if the command sequence is not detected and aborted.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted BufWinLeave autocommand that reopens a closed buffer in a new split window.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to set up a specific Vim configuration with the described autocommand and execute commands that trigger the buffer unload.",
    "additional_details": "Vim has some logic to prevent this, but it can be bypassed with a slightly more complex command sequence. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when a buffer is closed and the `BufWinLeave` autocmd re-opens it in a new split window after editing another file, leading to a use-after-free. The patch addresses this by checking if a newly edited buffer is locked and aborting if a locked buffer is detected."
