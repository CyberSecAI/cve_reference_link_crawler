Problem:  [security]: use-after-free when closing a buffer
Solution: When splitting the window and editing a new buffer,
          check whether the newly to be edited buffer has been marked
          for deletion and abort in this case

# use-after-free when closing buffers in Vim < v9.1.0764

## Affected versions

v9.1.0764

## Description

# use-after-free when closing buffers in Vim < 9.1.0764

**Date**: 06.10.2024

**Severity**: Low

**CVE**: CVE-2024-47814

**CWE**: Use After Free (CWE-416)

### Summary

A use-after-free was found in Vim < 9.1.0764

### Impact

When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command

can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the

same buffer in a new split window.

While vim already has some logic to determine such a case, so that a

simple:

```
au BufWinLeave foobar :vsp foobar

```

is already detected and such an auto command is aborted with E1159, a

slightly more complicated ex command to first edit another file and

then split the window and edit the original file again, confuses Vims

referencing counting and may still cause Vim to free the buffer

structure although it is still referenced in another window.

Patch 9.1.0764 changes that behaviour by checking if the newly to be

edited buffer is locked and aborts if such a case is detected.

Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a

strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this

may lead to a crash.

The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting

this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0764

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
