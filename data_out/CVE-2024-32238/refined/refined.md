{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect Access Control",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The H3C ER8300G2-X router allows access to the management system password through the login interface due to inadequate access controls.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain the password for the router's management system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the GET parameters on the login interface, specifically by modifying the URL to include `../actionpolicy_status/../ER8300G2-X.cfg` after `/userLogin.asp/`, an attacker can access the router's configuration file which contains the password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to capture network packets on the login interface of the router's management system and modify the parameters sent to the server."
