- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of IS-IS packets within the segment routing feature for the IS-IS protocol in Cisco IOS XR Software. This insufficient validation allows an attacker to send specially crafted IS-IS packets that can trigger a crash of the IS-IS process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the IS-IS process on affected devices participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specific, crafted IS-IS packets to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have successfully formed an adjacency with it. The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability, however, configuring IS-IS area authentication is recommended as a mitigation to slow down attackers.
