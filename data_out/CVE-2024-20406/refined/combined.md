| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software Segment Routing for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-isis-xehpbVNe  First Published: 2024 September 11 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCwi39542](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwi39542)     CVE-2024-20406     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2024-20406     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-isis-xehpbVNe/csaf/cisco-sa-isis-xehpbVNe.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IS-IS packets to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IS-IS process on all affected devices that are participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart, resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note**: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have formed an adjacency. This vulnerability affects segment routing for IS-IS over IPv4 and IPv6 control planes as well as devices that are configured as level 1, level 2, or multi-level routing IS-IS type.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-isis-xehpbVNe>  This advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco platforms if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and have the IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm enabled with either of the following features also enabled:    + Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance   + Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) for Flexible Algorithm For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration To determine whether a device has a vulnerable configuration, complete the following steps. If the device has IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm enabled but not Microloop Avoidance or TI-LFA, it is not affected by this vulnerability.  **1. Determine the IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm Status**  To determine whether a device has the IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm enabled, use the **show running-config router isis | include flex-algo**EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm, this command will return output. The following example shows the partial output on a device that is configured for IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#show running-config router isis | include flex-algoWed Sept 11 16:00:00.000 UTCflex-algo 200RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#   ```  If the device returns output, it may be affected by this vulnerability. Continue to Step 2.  If the device returns no output, it is not affected by this vulnerability. It is not necessary to complete Step 2 or Step 3.  **2. Determine the IS-IS Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance Status**  To determine whether a device has IS-IS Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance enabled, use the **show running-config router isis | include microloop** EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for IS-IS Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance, this command will return output. The following example shows the partial output on a device that is configured for IS-IS Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#show running-config router isis | include microloopWed Sept 11 16:00:00.000 UTC  microloop avoidance segment-routingRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#   ```  If the device returns output and IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm is enabled, it is affected by this vulnerability.  If the device returns no output, it does not have IS-IS Segment Routing Microloop Avoidance enabled. Continue to Step 3.  **3. Determine the TI-LFA for Flexible Algorithm Status**  To determine whether a device has TI-LFA for Flexible Algorithm enabled, use the **show running-config router isis | include ti-lfa** EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for IS-IS TI-LFA, this command will return output. The following example shows the partial output on a device that is configured for IS-IS TI-LFA for Flexible Algorithm.  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#show running-config router isis | include ti-lfaWed Sept 11 16:00:00.000 UTC   fast-reroute per-prefix ti-lfaRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:XR#   ```  If the device returns output and IS-IS Segment Routing Flexible Algorithm is enabled, it is affected by this vulnerability.  If the device returns no output, it does not have IS-IS TI-LFA for Flexible Algorithm enabled and it is not affected by this vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there is a mitigation.  As a best practice, configure IS-IS area authentication so attackers would first have to pass the authentication to trigger this vulnerability. For more information on IS-IS authentication, see [Configuring IS-IS Authentication](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/routing/24xx/configuration/guide/b-routing-cg-ncs5500-24xx/implementing-isis.html#con_1276647).  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.
