- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RegistrationMagic WordPress plugin, in versions 5.3.0.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it, thereby forcing the user to execute the unwanted action on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into submitting a forged request.
