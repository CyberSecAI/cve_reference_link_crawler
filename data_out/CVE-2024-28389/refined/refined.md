- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `SpinWheelFrameSpinWheelModuleFrontController::sendEmail()` method within the "Entry,Exit and Subscription Popup-Spin and Win" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `$slice_no` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock adminâ€™s ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via an HTTP call to the vulnerable front controller of the PrestaShop module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required and the attacker can be anonymous. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
