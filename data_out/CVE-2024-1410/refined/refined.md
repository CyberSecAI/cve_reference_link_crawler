- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unbounded storage of information related to connection ID retirement due to a mismatch between the rate of receiving NEW\_CONNECTION\_ID frames and sending RETIRE\_CONNECTION\_ID frames. The vulnerability lies in the way quiche handles connection IDs and their retirement, specifically when a peer is manipulated to slow down the sending of RETIRE\_CONNECTION\_ID frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded resource consumption vulnerability, specifically a denial-of-service vulnerability due to unbounded queue growth. The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper handling of connection ID retirement under specific circumstances.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause excessive resource consumption on the vulnerable system, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. The attacker sends malicious NEW\_CONNECTION\_ID frames while manipulating the connection (e.g., restricting the peer's congestion window size) to slow down the sending of RETIRE\_CONNECTION\_ID frames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated, but they need to be able to send QUIC frames and manipulate the connection. The attack complexity is considered high.
