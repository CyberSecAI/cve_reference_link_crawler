Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1426

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Price List" widget of the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin. Specifically, the 'link' attribute of this widget was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. This occurs because unsanitized user input in the 'link' attribute is stored in the database and later rendered in the page, allowing malicious scripts to execute in the browsers of other users who visit the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a user's browser session when a page containing the vulnerable widget is accessed.
- **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the 'link' attribute of the Price List widget.
- An attacker would need to insert malicious JavaScript code into this attribute via the plugin's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to WordPress.
- **Plugin Usage:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit content with the vulnerable "Price List" widget.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was in `bdthemes-element-pack-lite/trunk/modules/price-list/widgets/price-list.php`, specifically related to how the link attribute was handled when rendering the price list item's link.
- The fix involves using `esc_url()` to sanitize the URL before using it in the `onclick` attribute of the link and also using `wp_kses_post()` for other parts of the output.
- The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 5.6.0 of the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 5.6.1.
