| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Honeywell Saia PG5 Controls Suite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of xml files. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | 09/02/22 – ZDI reported the vulnerability to the vendor.  08/30/23 – ZDI asked for an update.  08/30/23 – ZDI re-submitted the report to the vendor.  12/13/23 – ZDI made multiple attempts to contact the vendor PSIRT about these reports, and we have not received a response.  -- Mitigation: Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application |
