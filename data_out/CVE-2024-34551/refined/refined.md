- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include local files of the target website and display their content. This could allow access to sensitive information, such as database credentials, potentially leading to a complete database takeover depending on the server configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by including local files, likely through a vulnerable parameter in the theme's code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
