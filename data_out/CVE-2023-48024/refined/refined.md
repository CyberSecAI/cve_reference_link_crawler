The provided content describes two distinct memory corruption vulnerabilities in the `liblisp` library: a use-after-free and an out-of-bounds read, both discovered through fuzzing.

**1. Use-after-free in `hash_destroy`:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `hash_destroy` function in `hash.c` frees memory associated with hash entries but continues to access it after it has been freed. This occurs because the `free(prev)` is inside the loop, but the `cur` pointer is used next loop. There is also a second `free(prev)` outside the loop, which is a double free. The final `free(h)` at the end is intended to deallocate the hash table itself.
*   **Weakness:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect memory management and double free.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to accessing freed memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering the `hash_destroy` function with a crafted input to the library that causes the use-after-free condition. The specific input is provided in the attached `uaf-liblisp.zip` file, which can be used for reproduction.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `liblisp` library.

**2. Out-of-bounds read in `get_length`:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `get_length` function in `eval.c` attempts to access `x->p[1].v` of a `lisp_cell_t` structure without ensuring that `x` points to a valid symbol and that the index 1 is within the bounds of the `p` array. A malformed symbol can cause `x->p[1].v` to read outside of allocated memory.
*  **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to reading memory outside of valid boundaries. The ASAN output shows this is a global buffer overflow, indicating the read went outside of a statically allocated variable.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing the library with input that results in the `get_length` function being called with a malformed symbol. The specific input to reproduce the issue is found in `oob-read-liblisp.zip`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `liblisp` library.
