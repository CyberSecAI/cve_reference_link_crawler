```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A change was made to prevent deadlocks when calling the database, which caused the 'Ignore unknown usernames' setting to not be respected in all cases. This resulted in the system leaking information about the existence of user accounts through specific error messages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information disclosure via error messages"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can determine whether a user account exists on the system by observing the specific error message returned by the system. This bypasses the protection offered by the 'Ignore unknown usernames' setting.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the network, specifically by attempting authentication against the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send authentication requests to the system. No specific privileges are required and no user interaction is needed."
