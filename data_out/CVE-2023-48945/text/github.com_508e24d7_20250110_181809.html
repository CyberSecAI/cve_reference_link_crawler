| The PoC is generated by my DBMS fuzzer.  ``` CREATE TABLE v0 ( v1 DECIMAL ) ;    INSERT INTO v0 VALUES ( 0 ) ;    INSERT INTO v0 ( v1 ) SELECT CASE v1 WHEN 49 THEN v1 ELSE -128 END FROM v0 AS v2 , v0 , v0 AS v3 GROUP BY v1 , v1 ;    UPDATE v0 SET v1 = ( SELECT DISTINCT * FROM v0 ) ;  ```  Server Log:  ``` 14:21:24 HTTP/WebDAV server online at 8890 14:21:24 Server online at 1111 (pid 1) *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated  ```  Due to the stack smashing, I failed to retrieve the correct backtrace.  ways to reproduce (write poc to the file '/tmp/test.sql' first):  ``` # remove the old one docker container rm virtdb_test -f # start virtuoso through docker docker run --name virtdb_test -itd --env DBA_PASSWORD=dba openlink/virtuoso-opensource-7:7.2.11 # wait the server starting sleep 10 # check whether the simple query works echo "SELECT 1;" | docker exec -i virtdb_test isql 1111 dba # run the poc cat /tmp/test.sql | docker exec -i virtdb_test isql 1111 dba ``` |
