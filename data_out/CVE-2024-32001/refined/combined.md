# LookupSubjects may return partial results if a specific kind of relation is used

Low

[ecordell](/ecordell)
published
GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2
Apr 10, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/authzed/spicedb
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.30.1

## Patched versions

1.30.1

## Description

### Background

Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for *either* `folder` or `folder#parent`.

This bug *only* manifests if the *same* subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types *and* an arrow is used over the relation.

### Impact

Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected.

### Workarounds

Avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.

### Severity

Low

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
