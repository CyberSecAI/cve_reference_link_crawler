Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `Admin Trim Interface` plugin including test files with `display_errors` enabled, which exposes sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Full Path Disclosure: The plugin's test files have `display_errors` set to `on`. When an error occurs, the server reveals the full file path of the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An unauthenticated attacker can obtain the full path of the web application.
- Secondary Attack Vector: The exposed full path information can be used to assist in further attacks by providing the attacker with valuable information about the server's structure. It requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated access to a plugin's test files that has error displaying enabled can reveal the server's full file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication, simply access to the vulnerable test file with error displaying enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `Admin Trim Interface` plugin up to and including 3.5.1.
- A patch is not available as of the time the report was written. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by stealthcopter and publicly published on July 26, 2024.
