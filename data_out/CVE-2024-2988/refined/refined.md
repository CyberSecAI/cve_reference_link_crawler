Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSetRouteStatic` function of the Tenda FH1203 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `entrys` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` operation without proper bounds checking. Specifically, `sprintf(v15, "%s;%s", v12, (const char *)v14);` is vulnerable, where the size of `v15` is fixed, and the attacker controlled `v14` (derived from `entrys`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted POST request with an overly long `entrys` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The provided information and POC suggests that this can lead to a denial of service or allow an attacker to gain control over the device by overflowing the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/fromRouteStatic` endpoint.
- The attack vector is the `entrys` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the device. Typically, this means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device, or have the device exposed to the internet.
- The attacker needs to know the device IP address.

**Additional Details (From GitHub Content):**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1203 V2.0.1.6.
- The vulnerable code snippet is inside the `fromSetRouteStatic` function.
- The `v5` variable is a copy of the user-supplied `entrys` parameter.
- The `sprintf` function is used to format a string using the user-controlled data, leading to a buffer overflow.
- The provided PoC sends a POST request with a 1000-byte long string as the value for the `entrys` parameter, which successfully demonstrates the vulnerability.
