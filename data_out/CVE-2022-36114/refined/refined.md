Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cargo did not limit the amount of data extracted from compressed archives. This allowed a specially crafted package to extract more data than its size, leading to potential disk space exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of a size limit on extracted data from compressed archives.
- The vulnerability allows a form of "zip bomb" attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disk space exhaustion on the machine running Cargo, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker uploads a malicious package to an alternate registry.
- A user downloads and attempts to unpack the malicious package via Cargo.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload packages to an alternate registry.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious package that extracts more data than its size, also known as a "zip bomb".

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects users of alternate registries but not users of crates.io due to server-side checks already in place.
-  The fix involves introducing a `LimitErrorReader` that enforces a 512MB limit on the unpacked size of a crate.
-  While this vulnerability is considered a "low" severity issue, the advisory mentions that a malicious dependency can perform more damage regardless via build scripts and procedural macros.
-  The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo prior to the fix in version 0.65.0.
- The CVSS score is 4.2, with a "moderate" severity due to the High Availability impact.
- The attack complexity is "High" because crafting a "zip bomb" style package is not trivial. The Privileges required is also "High", meaning the attacker needs to be able to upload a package to an alternate registry. User interaction is "Required" as a user must download and try to use the malicious crate.
- The Weakness is classified as CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.
