Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ttbm_new_place_save` function within the WordPress Tour & Travel Booking Plugin for WooCommerce – WpTravelly. This function is responsible for creating and publishing new "place" posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The `ttbm_new_place_save` function lacks a capability check, meaning it does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to create new posts.
*   **CSRF:** The function is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which could allow an attacker to force a logged-in user to create places without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to create and publish new "place" posts on the website. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Adding inappropriate content.
    *   Defacing the site with unwanted locations.
    *   Manipulating the site’s content for phishing or other harmful purposes.
    *   Potentially disrupting the functionality of the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The missing authorization check means that an attacker does not need any login credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Direct Request:** An attacker can send a direct request to the `ttbm_new_place_save` AJAX endpoint to create new place posts.
*    **CSRF:** A CSRF attack can be launched by tricking an authenticated user into submitting a forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
*   **No User Account Required:** The attacker does not need a user account or any elevated privileges on the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided code snippets show the removal of the vulnerable function `ttbm_new_place_save` in the `TTBM_Settings_place_you_see.php` file and corresponding JavaScript code from `ttbm_admin_script.js` and addition of nonce verification as part of the fix.
*   The Wordfence article explicitly states that versions up to and including 1.7.1 are affected, and the patched version is 1.7.2.
