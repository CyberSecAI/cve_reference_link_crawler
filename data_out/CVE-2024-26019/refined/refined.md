Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-26019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when processing form submissions. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize data before using it in a context where it will be interpreted as HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it stores unsanitized input related to form submissions. This means an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected pages. This specific vulnerability occurs within submit processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the web browsers of users accessing the website. This allows the attacker to perform a variety of actions, such as:
    -   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    -   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    -   Modifying the content of the webpage.
    -   Performing actions on behalf of the user, which can lead to account compromise if the targeted user has admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Form Submission:** The primary attack vector is through form submissions. An attacker crafts a malicious payload within a form field, which is then stored by the plugin and rendered without proper sanitization.
-   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction as the user needs to access the page or content where the malicious script is being rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to a Form:** An attacker must have the ability to submit a form, which is a basic capability of users interacting with forms.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker must know which form field is vulnerable to the XSS injection.
-  **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low level privileges, allowing them to use the form.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability affects Ninja Forms versions prior to 3.8.1.
-   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 base score of 5.4, indicating a medium severity.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Ryotaro Imamura of SB Technology Corp.
