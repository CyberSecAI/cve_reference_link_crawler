### 1st class Product & Support

I recently created a very complex form for a client using Ninja Forms, taking full advantage of the *Layout & Styles* and *Conditional Logic* plugins.

The client expected the form to perform miracles and whenever I found myself stuck with a request, the Ninja Forms Support team were there to show me the magic. Now my client thinks I’m a genius, but all credit goes to the team at WP Ninjas!!!

### Clean, Efficient and Full of Features

Having investigated all the major brands Ninja forms was the only one which gave me the features I needed. The save progress is simple and so powerful because you can interact with the user as they save their progress, something which was essential for my project.

Of course with every plugin you come across hurdles and that’s when I was really glad I purchased Ninja forms. The support has been fantastic, responsive, knowledgeable and just generally really keen to help me solve my problem.

That’s a 5 star plug-in for me.

### The Perfect Contact Form

I have tried quite a few forms over the years, but the last 2 years I have been exclusively using Ninja Forms on all my clients websites. The fast support, functionality and UI is great, especially since 3.0. The premium add-ons have made it easy to add new functionality and integration with third party apps, and have provided a solution for every client need so far.

### Best Form Out There

This plugin offers the best form available. I spent an entire day searching for a contact form I could use without having to pay to make the simple set up work – but did have a feature rich upgrade.

I finally found Ninja Forms and have been EXTREMELY satisfied. I also contacted help on two occasions. The first time, I received a response within 30 minutes. The second time, on a weekend, I sent a question in the afternoon and received a response the same evening.

Five Stars, Two Thumbs Up – Simply AWESOME!

### Excellent and Generous

Of all the plugins I’ve ever used, Ninja Forms is by far the most professional one. Very easy to use, so many features that are included, the user interface is very easy to understand, and the form has been excellent. I am using it for many purposes and it makes my life very very very easy. Multiple forms each having lot of settings such as custom reply to and cc options and lot more. The team is mindblowing. very supportive, understanding, and generous. I’ve never witnessed such professionalism ever before! I totally recommend this plugin, not only you feel the worth of every penny you spend on it, but you also feel like you are part of their family.

### How did I ever get along without this?!?!?!

This has made forms so so so so so much easier. I showed this to a friend who had NEVER worked with web forms and in one afternoon, he was up and running with a sophisticated email form that looks like it was done by a professional and this friend is so NOT a geek. Read the documentation and this will become your new best friend!

### Patrick Rauland

As a developer I love how easy it is to customize Ninja Forms. It's built in a modular form so at any point you can inject your own programming and change the output. If you need to add a hook for some custom logic you can suggest it on GitHub or send a pull request yourself and it will quickly be merged into the main plugin. All round there isn't a better form plugin for developers or anyone really.
