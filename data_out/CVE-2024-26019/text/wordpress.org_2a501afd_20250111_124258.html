## Description

#### Forms that grow with your business

As one of WordPress’ oldest form builders, we’re proud to serve users from around the world, from all walks of life, and from different stages of online growth. From the small businesses and local nonprofits that make up the core Ninja Forms user base to universities, hospitals, and even Fortune 500 companies, we’ll scale with you from startup to wherever you’re aiming for.

We’re committed to offering as many free, open source tools as we can get away with to back you up in the extremely price-conscious early days. As you grow, pick and choose only the premium features you need as you need them. We’ll grow with you from there for as far as you want to take us.

We’re also committed to respecting your privacy and time. No unsolicited emails or aggressive marketing. No paywalling basic features or scraping private data. We offer a fully staffed team of support experts and a comprehensive library of plugin documentation for all users, free and paid, to help keep you collecting the submissions that move your business forward.

We look forward to seeing where you’ll take us!

#### All the basics without the paywalls

When you find yourself wanting just one or two things, you can grab just what you need without paying for extras.

When you’re ready for more, our [membership plans](https://ninjaforms.com/pricing/?utm_source=WordPress.org&utm_medium=Plugin+readme&utm_campaign=Feature+List&utm_content=Pricing) bundle popular features together in budget friendly packages.

The support was very prompt and helpful, but I’m not keen on the form editor. It’s nice if you’re not a developer I guess, but seems very long winded to me.

I needed help to find the right membership, which turned out to involve cancelling my Pro membership and replace it with a Plus membership. No problem what so ever! Immediate answer and a friendly response. Great support!

Tried every version I could, got blank pages, then javascript errors. Ended up being faster (after 2 days of messing with their awful code) to program the form and manually receive it myself.

We utilize Ninja Forms & Plugins on all our client websites, including those requiring multiple payment streams, sophisticated conditional logic, and the like. Everything fits together well and works as expected. And, whenever there’s a need for support, the Ninja Forms team responds quickly, with the correct answers. It all works!!

Sometimes, you only know how good a plugin is once you find a problem. I have used Ninja Forms for several years, and I am glad I didn’t let a minor issue cause me to switch to a different plugin.I was disappointed that I did not receive an answer when I posted it on their WP forum, but I realized that they prioritize answering queries on their site. They make this very clear in the pinned topic at the top of the page, but of course, I didn’t bother to read it at first.
When I posted my question with the context and detail they required, I got a swift response that helped me work around a known bug. That kind of response builds confidence that my investment in learning a plugin’s function will be well worth it.
