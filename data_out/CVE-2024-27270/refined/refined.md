- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that occurs when the servlet-6.0 feature is enabled in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed in the context of a legitimate user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through the servlet-6.0 feature. The specific details on how this injection is achieved are not provided in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts, which typically involves manipulating input that is reflected back to a user. The exact nature of the user interaction is not provided in this document.
