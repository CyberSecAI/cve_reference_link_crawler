{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `skb->dev` could be reset to `nf_bridge->physindev` after the skb has been added to the `neigh->arp_queue`. There is no mechanism to ensure that `physindev` isn't freed while the skb is still in queue. This can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect handling of network device references in bridged network configurations.",
       "Lack of synchronization between device freeing and skb usage"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash due to a use-after-free vulnerability. The system will likely become unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": "Packets traversing a network bridge that are subject to destination network address translation (DNAT) can trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when an skb is added to `neigh->arp_queue` while waiting for an ARP reply and the original `skb->dev` is different from `neigh->dev`.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send network traffic that is processed by a bridge device configured with DNAT. The attacker does not require root or any other special privileges to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Replaced the `physindev` (net_device pointer) with `physinif` (ifindex) in the `nf_bridge_info` struct.",
    "Used `dev_get_by_index_rcu()` to look up the `net_device` using the `physinif` whenever the original `net_device` is needed. If no device is found the skb is dropped."
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the usage of the `nf_bridge->physindev` pointer after the skb was queued in a neighbor's arp queue, this pointer can become invalid after a device has been removed, leading to a use-after-free. The fix replaces the storage of the device pointer with the interface index. The device is retrieved with `dev_get_by_index_rcu()` to avoid use-after-free. If a device cannot be retrieved, the skb is dropped."
