Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-20011:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper filtering of notification APIs (`getActiveNotifications` and `getHistoricalNotifications`) by user. This means that a user could potentially access notifications intended for other users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Disclosure (ID):**  The core vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. Due to insufficient filtering, a user can potentially retrieve notification data associated with other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker could potentially view sensitive notification data from other users on the same device. The specific nature of the information disclosed would depend on the content of the notifications themselves, but could include personal messages, application activity, and other potentially private data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device. An attacker needs to be able to execute code or have user privileges on the device.
*   **Exploitation of Notification APIs:** The vulnerability lies in the way notification APIs `getActiveNotifications` and `getHistoricalNotifications` are implemented. The attacker would need to exploit the lack of proper user filtering within these APIs to retrieve unauthorized information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **User Execution Privileges:** The attacker needs to have User execution privileges on the device.
*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves filtering the notification APIs by user.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "High" severity.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 10, 11, 12, and 12L.
*   The AOSP commit `f315ba91df3829d862371fbab9da584ce0a59bc6` addresses the vulnerability.
* The fix was cherry-picked from commit `73745b16e89b51dfe4328faa817ba50024382050`.
