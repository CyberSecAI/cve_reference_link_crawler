- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FortiOS and FortiProxy when processing crafted packets within proxy policies or firewall policies utilizing proxy mode with SSL deep packet inspection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-124).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted packets to the vulnerable FortiOS or FortiProxy device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send crafted packets that reach proxy policies or firewall policies with proxy mode alongside SSL deep packet inspection enabled on the targeted device.
