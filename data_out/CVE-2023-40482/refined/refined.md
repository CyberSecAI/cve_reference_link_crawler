- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of SKP files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious SKP file or visits a malicious page that handles SKP files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious SKP file or control a web page visited by the user, and the user must interact with the application by opening the file or visiting the malicious page.
