- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in `tinyxml2::XMLUtil::GetCharacterRef` when parsing very long character entities (`&#...;`). The function tries to parse the entity from `#` to `;`, and when the parsed value is excessively large, it triggers an assertion failure due to `mult <= UINT_MAX / 16`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to an assertion failure, which results in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The program crashes due to the assertion failure, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted XML file with a very long character entity is used as input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted XML file to be parsed by the vulnerable application.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description by providing a detailed call stack and a proof-of-concept. It also includes a suggested mitigation of disabling the processing of entities during parsing.
