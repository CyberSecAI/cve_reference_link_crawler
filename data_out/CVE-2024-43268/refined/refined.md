Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Backup and Restore plugin. This missing check allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly enforce access control, enabling unauthorized actions. This is a direct violation of the principle of least privilege.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited, though specific impact is noted to vary on a case-by-case basis. However, the fundamental issue is that an attacker could potentially bypass access restrictions and perform administrative functions.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin itself, leveraging the function that is missing the proper access control checks.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker only needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Backup and Restore WordPress Plugin" up to and including 1.50.
    *   There is no official fix available, but Patchstack has released a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.
