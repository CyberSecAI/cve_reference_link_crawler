Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'wpw\_auto\_poster\_map\_wordpress\_post\_type' AJAX function of the Social Auto Poster plugin. Specifically, the 'wp\_name' parameter is not properly handled, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the WordPress database via the vulnerable parameter. This injected script will then execute when a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a range of malicious activities.
*   **Account Takeover:** The injected script could potentially be used to steal session cookies, which can be used to perform actions as the logged-in user, including administrative actions if the user is an admin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network through HTTP requests.
*   **AJAX Function:** The specific attack vector involves the 'wpw\_auto\_poster\_map\_wordpress\_post\_type' AJAX function and its 'wp\_name' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the WordPress site with at least a Subscriber-level access. This means they need an account on the affected site.
*   **Access to vulnerable AJAX function:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Social Auto Poster plugin up to and including 5.3.14.
*   The vendor has released version 5.3.15 to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.
