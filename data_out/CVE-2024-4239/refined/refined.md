Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow exists in the `formSetRebootTimer` function of the Tenda AX1806 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the `rebootTime` parameter of the `formSetRebootTimer` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for a stack buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device. This could potentially allow an attacker to completely take control of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `rebootTime` parameter in the `formSetRebootTimer` function, likely via an HTTP request to the `/goform/SetRebootTimer` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the router containing an oversized `rebootTime` parameter. This suggests the attacker would likely need to be on the same network as the router, or have some form of remote access.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is found in the Tenda AX1806 router firmware (specifically v1.0.0.1).
- The vulnerability is located in the `formSetRebootTimer` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the `rebootTime` parameter.
- The provided github link points to a markdown file related to this vulnerability.
