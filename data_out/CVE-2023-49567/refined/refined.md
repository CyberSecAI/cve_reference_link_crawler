- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality incorrectly checks website certificates, specifically trusting certificates issued using MD5 and SHA1 collision hash functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure trust of certificates using collision hash functions (MD5 and SHA1).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on SSL connections to arbitrary websites, creating rogue certificates that appear legitimate. This could lead to data interception, manipulation, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack occurs by intercepting and manipulating the SSL/TLS handshake between the client and server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned to perform a MITM attack on the network. The attacker also needs to be able to generate certificates using MD5 or SHA1 collision techniques which will be trusted by the vulnerable software.
