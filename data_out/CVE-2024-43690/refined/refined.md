- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-829).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code due to the inclusion of functionality from an untrusted source.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected systems, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs High Privileges (PR:H) to exploit the vulnerability and User Interaction is not required (UI:N). The vulnerability has a scope change (S:C), meaning the impact extends beyond the vulnerable component.
