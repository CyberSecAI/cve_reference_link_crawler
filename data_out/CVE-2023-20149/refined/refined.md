- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device, then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device and persuade a user to visit a crafted web page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
