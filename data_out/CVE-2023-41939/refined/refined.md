Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41939:

**CVE-2023-41939**

*   **Root Cause:** The SSH2 Easy Plugin does not verify if configured permissions are actually enabled, potentially granting users access they should no longer have.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks proper permission verification. When a permission is disabled, the plugin does not revoke the access granted previously using that permission.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Users who were previously granted permissions (such as Overall/Manage, which is typically an optional permission) can retain access to functionality that they're no longer entitled to, potentially allowing them to perform actions they should not have access to, such as managing Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability if they had previously been granted specific permissions via the plugin, and those permissions were subsequently disabled. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers would need to have had the permissions in the past that were granted by the plugin and then disabled by administrators. The vulnerability can be triggered by any user who previously had permissions granted through the plugin but are now disabled, provided they had access to the functionality in the past.

The provided content also includes a workaround: Administrators can save the permission configuration after disabling a permission, which will overwrite any permission assignments of disabled permissions. The affected feature has been removed without replacement in version 1.6 of the SSH2 Easy Plugin.
