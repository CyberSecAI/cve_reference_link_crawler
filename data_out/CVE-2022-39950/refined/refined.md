- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer report templates. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the insufficient sanitization of crafted CKeditor "protected" comments, as described in CVE-2020-9281, which are embedded within the report templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79].
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands within the context of the victim's browser session. This may lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious CKeditor "protected" comment and embeds it into a report template. When a user views the report, the malicious script embedded in the comment is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low privilege level account and the ability to post/upload a crafted report template. They must also induce a victim to view the crafted report.
