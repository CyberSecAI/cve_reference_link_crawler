The provided content describes a memory leak fix in the Linux kernel's AMD display driver, and does not relate to a security vulnerability described in a CVE.

The root cause is an unreferenced memory object allocated in `dc_link_construct` function when constructing a display link. The `info` object is allocated with `kmem_cache_alloc_trace` but not freed when exiting successfully, leading to a memory leak.

The vulnerability is a memory leak. 
The impact of the vulnerability is that it can cause the system to run out of memory over time if the `dc_link_construct` is called repeatedly.
The attack vector is calling the `dc_link_construct` function repeatedly.
No specific attacker capabilities/position are required beyond causing the loading of the display driver.

The fix consists of adding a `kfree(info);` call to release the allocated memory.
