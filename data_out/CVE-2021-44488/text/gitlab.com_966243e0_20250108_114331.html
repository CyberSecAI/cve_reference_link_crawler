# Fix bugs exposed by fuzz testing

# Final Release Note

As described in [Fuzz Testing YottaDB](https://yottadb.com/fuzz-testing-yottadb/), implementing a new type of testing in YottaDB exposed bugs that were neither previously discovered in development environments, nor reported by users. This Issue captures 40 such bugs fixed in the r1.34 release. We intend to create a separate Issue for each YottaDB release that includes fixes for bugs exposed by fuzz testing. [[#828 (closed)](/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828 "Fix bugs exposed by fuzz testing")]

# Description

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing> for details on fuzz testing. This issue is to try that testing technique out on YottaDB and see if there are any crashes and, if so, fix them.
