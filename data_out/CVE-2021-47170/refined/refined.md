  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The kernel was generating warnings when a user tried to submit a bulk transfer with an excessively large buffer through usbfs. While not a bug, the memory allocation requests were triggering warnings from the MM subsystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The kernel was not handling excessively large memory allocation requests from usbfs without generating warnings."
    ],
    "impact": "The excessive memory allocation requests were generating warnings. This was not a functional bug, but it cluttered the logs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Submitting a bulk transfer request through usbfs with an overly large buffer."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the usbfs interface and submit a bulk transfer request with an excessively large buffer."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves adding the __GFP_NOWARN flag to the kmalloc calls used for allocating buffers in the usbfs code.",
      "This prevents the MM subsystem from issuing warnings related to these requests. This is applied to bulk transfers, async transfers, and packet descriptor tables for isochronous transfers."
