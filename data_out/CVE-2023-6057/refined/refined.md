- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of certificate chains in Bitdefender Total Security's HTTPS scanning feature. Specifically, the software incorrectly trusts certificates signed using the DSA algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure trust of certificates signed with the DSA algorithm. Lack of proper certificate chain validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and potentially modify encrypted traffic. The attacker can establish a connection to arbitrary websites using a maliciously crafted DSA-signed certificate. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the user and a server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the user and the server. The attacker also needs to have a DSA-signed certificate under their control.
