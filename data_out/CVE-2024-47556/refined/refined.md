- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path Traversal
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities via path traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, pre-authentication path traversal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers do not require authentication.
