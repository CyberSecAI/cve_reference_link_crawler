The provided content describes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the back-end management system of Shanxi Internet Chuangxiang Technology Co., Ltd.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an interface that retrieves images after logging into the backend. This interface uses GET parameters, specifically `Width` and `Height`, which can be controlled by the user. By providing very large values for these parameters, the server is forced to generate and transmit a very large image, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation or limitations on the `Width` and `Height` parameters.
- The system does not limit the amount of resources used for generating images, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Exploiting this vulnerability can cause significant access delays and potentially crash the backend management system, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable image retrieval endpoint, with large values for `Width` and `Height` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests.
- The attacker needs to have a valid admin login session, as the vulnerability is located in a backend interface. The provided information states the credentials for this access are `admin/123456`.
