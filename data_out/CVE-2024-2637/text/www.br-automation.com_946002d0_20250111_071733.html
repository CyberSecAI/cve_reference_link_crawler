Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular test-
ing with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasion-
ally an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product
cyber security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerabil-
ity handling process. This entails validating if the issue is in fact a product issue, identifying root causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide de-
tails on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that min-
imize the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a Cyber Security Advisory should not be mis-
construed as an affirmation or indication of an active threat or ongoing campaign targeting the
products mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the com-
munication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user commu-
nity in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust
we work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information
which is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) v3.11.

CVE-2024-2637

An uncontrolled search path element vulnerability in several B&R software products could allow an authen-
ticated  local  attacker to  execute  malicious  code  by  placing  specially  crafted  files  in  the  loading  search
path.

Mitigating factors

Strengthen installation folder permissions

To avoid the replacement of legitimate with malicious DLL, ensure that the B&R software installation fold-
ers are only writable by privileged users.

Ensure Safe DLL search mode is enabled

Safe  DLL  search  mode  is  enabled  by  default  on  Windows  operating  systems.  However,  there  might  be
scenarios where this is disabled. For more information, please refer to the Microsoft website [1].

Follow least-privilege principles and ensure the physical security of the computers

Ensure that only authorized users have access to the computers and that their privileges are restricted to
the minimum necessary (least-privilege principle).

Refer to section “General security recommendations” for further advice on how to keep your system se-
cure.

Frequently asked questions

What is the scope of the vulnerability?

An authenticated local attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could insert and run arbitrary
code using malicious DLL files and executables on an affected system node.

What causes the vulnerability?

The vulnerability is caused by exploiting the Windows search and load order used by software applica-
tions for loading DLL files and improper integrity checks when executing code from untrusted locations.

1 The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in this advisory since it reflects
the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’ computing environment; end-user organizations
are therefore recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental Score.

What is B&R Scene Viewer

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R Scene Viewer is a software to visualize the movements of machines in a 3D environment. The anima-
tion of the machine components is controlled by cyclically reading OPC-UA watchables, typically from a
PLC.

What is B&R Automation Runtime (AR)?

B&R Automation Runtime (AR) is a real-time operating system running on all B&R target systems.

What is VC 4?

B&R VC4 is a software package for generating human-machine interfaces using Automation Studio. These
interfaces can be used to control machines or display information about current operations. B&R VC4 vis-
ualization is using VNC technology

What is mapp Vision?

Together with B&R's fully integrated vision solution, the mapp Vision software package makes machine
vision applications much easier to create, maintain and diagnose.

What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code using malicious DLL files
or executables on an affected system node.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?

An authenticated local attacker can use the Windows search and load order or replace legitimate software
components in an insufficient secured system to execute malicious code. Recommended practices help
mitigate such attacks, see section Mitigating Factors above.

Could the vulnerability be exploited remotely?

Yes, an authenticated attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit this vul-
nerability.

 Recommended  practices  include  that  process  control  systems  are  physically  protected,  have  no  direct
connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that
has a minimal number of ports exposed.

What does the update do?

The updates restrict the search sequence when loading components and limit the execution of compo-
nents from untrusted sources.

When this security advisory was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?

No, B&R discovered this vulnerability as a part of its own security analyses.

When this security advisory was issued, had B&R received any reports that this
vulnerability was being exploited?

No, B&R is not aware that the vulnerability is being exploited in any of the listed products when this advi-
sory was published.

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-ex-
haustive) list of cyber security practices:

–

–

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls
and separate them from any general purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, periph-
eral equipment, and networks.

–  Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-

work other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

–  Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

–  Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

–  Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

–  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Rec-
ognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version availa-
ble. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
