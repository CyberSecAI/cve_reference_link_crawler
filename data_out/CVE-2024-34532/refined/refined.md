Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `get_result_from_query` method of the `query_deluxe` module. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries through the `query` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The `get_result_from_query` method directly uses the provided `query` parameter in an SQL query without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute malicious SQL commands.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, and data tampering. In the provided example, the attacker modifies the admin user's password, thus escalating privileges.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the external API of the Odoo instance. A portal or internal user with the `query_deluxe` module installed can call the vulnerable `get_result_from_query` method and inject SQL code via the `query` argument.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a portal or internal user of an Odoo instance with the `query_deluxe` module installed. The attacker also needs the ability to interact with the Odoo instance's external API.
