Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-44480:

**Verification:** The content directly references CVE-2023-44480 and provides specific details about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation for the `setcasualleave` parameter in the `admin/setleaves.php` resource. User-supplied data is passed directly to the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authenticated SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the SQLi vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or potentially complete database compromise. The impact is rated as high with a CVSSv3 base score of 9.8.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via HTTP requests to `admin/setleaves.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application in order to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint
- No special skills or positioning besides authentication are required.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code:
```php
$setsickleave = strip_tags(trim($_POST['setsickleave']));
$setearnleave = strip_tags(trim($_POST['setearnleave']));
$setcasualleave = strip_tags(trim($_POST['setcasualleave']));
...
$update = "UPDATE employees SET CasualLeave = '".$setcasualleave."' WHERE Dept = '".$row2["Dept"]."'";
$conn->query($update);
```
- The `$setcasualleave` variable, after minimal processing via `strip_tags` and `trim`, is directly inserted into an SQL query without escaping or parameterization.

The provided content also includes details for two other CVEs:

**CVE-2023-44481:** Similar to CVE-2023-44480, but involves the `setearnleave` parameter.
**CVE-2023-44482:** Similar to CVE-2023-44480, but involves the `setsickleave` parameter.

The root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors and attacker requirements are the same for all three CVEs, just different POST parameters involved.
