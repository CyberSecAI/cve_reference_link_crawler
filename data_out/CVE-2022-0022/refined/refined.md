- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm for storing password hashes of administrator and local user accounts in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software. The password hashes are not created with sufficient computational effort, making them susceptible to cracking attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (CWE-916). This allows attackers to potentially crack the stored password hashes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to administrator or local user accounts by cracking the password hashes. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers need access to the password hashes to exploit this vulnerability. This can be achieved by gaining access to the PAN-OS software configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges on the local system or have access to the configuration where password hashes are stored. This requires local access and a high level of privileges.
