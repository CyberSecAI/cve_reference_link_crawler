The provided content describes a vulnerability in GitLab where a guest user can bypass API/UI restrictions to view dependency lists of private projects through job artifacts.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls on job artifacts, specifically the dependency scanning report (JSON file) generated during CI/CD pipelines. While UI/API restrictions prevent guest users from directly accessing dependency lists, they can still access the same data through the job artifacts, which are not properly protected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on job artifacts containing sensitive data (dependency lists).
- **Bypass of UI/API Restrictions:** Guest users can bypass intended access restrictions through access to job artifacts, violating the principle of least privilege.
- **Data Leakage:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to dependency information for private projects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Guest users can gain unauthorized access to dependency lists of private projects. This information could potentially reveal vulnerabilities, expose sensitive project details, and assist attackers in planning further attacks.
- **Privacy Violation:** The vulnerability allows guest users to view the dependencies for private projects that they are not supposed to access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a guest user navigating to the CI/CD job details of a private project, and then browsing the job artifacts to download the dependency list.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest user within the group that owns the private project.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate the GitLab UI.
- The attacker needs to be aware of how to access job artifacts and specifically locate the gemnasium dependency scanning output.
