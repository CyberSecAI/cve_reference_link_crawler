Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `delete_seal.php` file of Tongda OA software. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `$DELETE_STR` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without adequate sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `$DELETE_STR` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** Directly concatenating user-provided input into SQL queries makes the system susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries that retrieve information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to the operating system if database user has specific privileges.
*   **Full Database Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the `delete_seal.php` script.
*   **Injection Point:** The `$DELETE_STR` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Tongda OA system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter ($DELETE_STR) and the injection point.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a blind SQL injection technique. By using `substr(DATABASE(),1,1)=char(116)`  and similar expressions, the attacker can extract information character by character based on the time it takes for the query to execute.

**Vulnerable versions:**
*   Less than v11.10
*   v2017
