* **Release Date:** 05-16-2024

## Preparation

### Check the firmware version

Follow these steps to check the current car audio system firmware version: If the version is displayed as **2.00**, you do not need to update the firmware.

1. Turn **ON** the car audio system.
2. On the **Home** screen, select **Settings**.
3. Select **General**.
4. Select **Firmware Version**. The current firmware version is then displayed.

## Download & Install

### How to download the update

1. Connect a USB storage device to your computer with at least 10 MB of available space and use a device with a maximum of 32 GB of USB storage device (**FAT16** or **FAT32**).
   * USB storage devices with the **exFAT** format are not supported.
   * USB storage devices with over 32 GB capacity are not supported.
2. Ensure that your computer is connected to the Internet.
3. Download the update file to your computer.
4. Unzip the downloaded zip file. There are 3 files (**SHSO2001.FIR**, **SHMC2001.U88**, and **SHDS2001.up6**).
5. Copy all 3 files to the root directory (the first folder you see when you open the USB storage device) of the USB storage device that you connected to your computer.
6. Disconnect the USB storage device from your computer.

### Important notice

* Park your car in a safe place and start the engine to avoid a voltage reduction in the car audio system’s power supply.
* Do not turn off the car audio system during the update.
* Do not disconnect the USB memory during the update.
* Set the date and time after the update.

### Step 1: Install the update

1. Connect the USB memory to the USB port 1 of the car audio system.
2. On the **Home** screen, select **Settings**. If you cannot find the **Settings** icon, swipe from the bottom of the **Home** screen, then from right to left.
3. Select **General**.
4. Select **Firmware Version**.
5. Select **Update**.
   * Check the file structure of the USB storage device if you cannot press the **Update** button. The update file may not be saved in the correct location in the USB storage device, or the file type may not be supported.
   * If the message **Please visit the support site and connect the USB device (with Update firmware) to USB port 1** is displayed on the car audio system, check the files in the USB storage device. The USB storage device may not contain the correct update file.
   * Download the latest update file if the version displayed is not **2.00**. You may not be using the correct update file.
6. Select **Update** again. The car audio system will begin updating.
7. When the following message is shown, remove the USB memory and insert it into the **USB port 2** of the car audio system. **Please disconnect the USB device from USB port 1 and connect it to USB port 2. The update will continue automatically.** and will take approximately 3 minutes to complete.

### Step 2: Confirm that the update was successful

1. Turn **ON** the car audio system.
2. On the **Home** screen, select **Settings**.
3. Select **General**.
4. Select **Firmware Version**. The current firmware version will then be displayed.
5. **Note:**  When **2.00** is displayed, the firmware update is complete.

If you are unable to update the firmware, please try again using another USB storage device.

## Questions & Answers

### Troubleshooting

* **The Update button is grayed out.**
   Check that the files (**SHSO2001.FIR**, **SHMC2001.U88**, and **SHDS2001.up6**) are properly saved in the root directory of the USB storage device.
* **The message *This data is not compatible* is displayed.**
   The USB storage device may be defective or does not contain the correct update files. Erase the existing files from the USB storage device, or use a different USB storage device, and then repeat the entire download and update process from the beginning.
