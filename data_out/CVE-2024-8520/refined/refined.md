Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8520:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from Wordfence and the github commit/PR clearly indicates that this CVE relates to a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the Ultimate Member plugin, which allows membership status changes, and therefore is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `admin_init` or `user_action_hook` function within the Ultimate Member plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to forge requests that can be executed by an authenticated administrator.
*   **Missing Nonce Validation:** The specific vulnerability lies in the absence or improper implementation of nonce checks in the specified admin actions handlers.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Membership Status Manipulation:** An attacker can modify a user's membership status without proper authorization. This could lead to unauthorized access, account suspension, or other disruptive actions.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the immediate impact is user status modification, this vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve greater impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable admin actions.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a site administrator into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link) that triggers the forged request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering Skill:** The attacker needs to trick an administrator into performing the malicious action.
*   **Administrator Target:** The attack requires the targeted user to have administrator privileges on the affected WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes links to the vulnerable code in the Ultimate Member plugin on GitHub, including files like `class-admin.php` and `class-admin-users.php`.
