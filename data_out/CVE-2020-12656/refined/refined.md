    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of certain domain_release calls in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to missing domain_release calls when unloading the module.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (memory exhaustion) by a local privileged attacker. Uncontrolled memory consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local privileged attacker can repeatedly load and unload the rpcsec_gss_krb5 module to trigger the memory leak.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local privileged access is required to load and unload kernel modules."
