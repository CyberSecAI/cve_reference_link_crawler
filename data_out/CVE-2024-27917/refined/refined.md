Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27917:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Symfony Session Handler assigns a session cookie to the HTTP response.
- In Shopware versions 6.5.8.0 to 6.5.8.6, 404 pages were cached to improve performance.
- The cached 404 responses included a session cookie, even if the browser accessing the 404 page didn't have one previously.
- This behavior did not occur when Redis was used for session management via the PHP Redis extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure caching of session cookies:** Caching responses with session cookies can lead to unintended session sharing or manipulation.
- **Lack of proper handling of session cookies on 404 pages:** The system failed to remove session cookies from 404 responses before caching them.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Customer logout or cart clearance:** When a cached 404 page with a session cookie is served to a guest browser, it can cause an active customer session to be invalidated, logging the customer out or clearing their shopping cart. This occurs because the session cookie in the cached response does not match the customerâ€™s current session.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Accessing 404 pages:** Directly accessing a 404 page or triggering a 404 error (e.g., by requesting a missing image). This would serve a cached response with a potentially invalid session cookie to the client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker does not need any specific capabilities. They only need to trigger a 404 error on the vulnerable system.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Shopware versions 6.5.8.0 to 6.5.8.6.
- The patch is available in Shopware version 6.5.8.7.
- A workaround is to use Redis for session storage, which does not trigger the exploit code.
- The vulnerability is related to the caching of 404 pages, not a direct vulnerability within the session handling itself. The session handler works as expected but interacts unexpectedly with the caching mechanism.
- The vulnerability was classified as "Critical".
- The fix involves modifying `\Shopware\Storefront\Framework\Routing\NotFound\NotFoundSubscriber` to remove all session cookies from 404 responses before they are cached.
