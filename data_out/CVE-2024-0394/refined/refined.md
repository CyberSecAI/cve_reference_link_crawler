The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0394.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Minerva's implementation of the OpenSSL library. Specifically, the `OPENSSLDIR` parameter was configured to point to a directory accessible by low-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper configuration of the `OPENSSLDIR` parameter in Minerva Armor, allowing low-privileged users to write to the configuration directory.
- Lack of proper access control on the OpenSSL configuration directory.
- The OpenSSL configuration file (`openssl.cnf`) allows the loading of an arbitrary OpenSSL engine library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation from low-privileged user to SYSTEM.
- Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- A low-privileged authenticated user can create a malicious `openssl.cnf` file and a malicious OpenSSL engine library. When the Minerva service starts, it loads the attacker-controlled `openssl.cnf` file, which loads the malicious library, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with low privileges on the Windows system where the vulnerable software is running.
- The attacker must be able to create files and directories in the location specified by the `OPENSSLDIR` parameter (e.g., `C:\git\vcpkg\packages\openssl_x86-windows-static-vs2019-static`).
