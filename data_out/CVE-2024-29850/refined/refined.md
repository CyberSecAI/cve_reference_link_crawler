- Network-based: The vulnerability is network exploitable.
- NTLM relay: The attack relies on relaying captured NTLM authentication requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the VBEM server.
- Ability to intercept network traffic.
- Ability to initiate an NTLM authentication attempt against a target (through a malicious server for the relay).
- User interaction: The vulnerability requires user interaction.
