Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Hengan Weighing Management Information Query Platform. This is due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation which allows for SQL injection attacks. The application directly concatenates user-supplied data into SQL queries without using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Obtain sensitive database information.
    *   Gain system permissions.
    *   Execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data tampering or deletion.
    *   Extract MD5 hashed values to gain further insights or access.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/用户管理/search_user.aspx` endpoint. The attacker modifies the `tuser_Number` parameter in the request body to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/用户管理/search_user.aspx`.
    *   The attacker would likely need a valid session (cookie) or be able to forge session information to access the vulnerable page. The provided example shows that the attacker needs to forge the `AdminInfo` cookie, which includes the `username` field.

**Additional details from the content:**

* The vulnerability affects versions of the software from 2019-2021.
* The provided example demonstrates how to inject a SQL query to extract an MD5 hash of a string.
* The content also includes suggested mitigations, such as:
    *   Updating to the latest version of the software.
    *   Using parameterized queries or precompiled statements.
    *   Filtering and validating user input.
