## Description

YayExtra is a WooCommerce plugin to allow you to create **extra product options** and assign them to your groups of products.

It comes with a variety of field types including dropdown list, multiple choice list, radio buttons, checkboxes, numbers, text inputs, color swatches, and more.

[DEMO](https://demo.yaycommerce.com/yayextra/product/t-shirt/) | [**YAYEXTRA PRO**](https://yaycommerce.com/yayextra-woocommerce-extra-product-options/) 💎

[Documentation](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yayextra/getting-started/introduction) | [Free vs Pro](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yayextra/why-upgrade)

### ⚡️ FEATURES

**Powerful Custom Product Options**

YayExtra supports a wide range of [WooCommerce product field types](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yayextra/how-it-works/option-types) to serve your diverse use cases.

* Allow customers to input text, number, email, etc.
* Add radio buttons to the original product
* Enable checkbox to allow for privacy policy acknowledgement
* Add button rows to customize the base product
* Add one time fee in percentage or fixed amount
* Add multiple fees to multiple product options
* Display the subtotal for the selected extras

**Multiple Options in an Option Set**

You can add many product custom fields in the same group. Related options can be displayed next to each other or vertically. A product field can trigger the display of the next product field.

**Apply Product Options in Bulk**

A group of product fields can be applied to all products, a group of products in a specific category, a group of products with a specific tag, or hand-picked products.

**Developer-Friendly**

This product options plugin allows using hooks for `before_calculate_totals` function to modify the [cart item line total](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yayextra/developer-zone).

**WooCommerce Conditional Variations**

YayExtra allows you to create a conditional logic so you can combine it with the existing custom options. Conditional logics help show the next product field if the user has selected a specific option value.

Let’s suppose that you sell car parts, so when the customer chooses to have “Accessories” then related options like “Front door items” or “Replacement kit” can be shown on the current product page. Otherwise, if the customer doesn’t check the “Accessories” checkbox then those options will not show up, which keeps your product page neat and clear.

### 💎 PREMIUM-ONLY FEATURES

**Advanced Product Addons**

Multiple field types are built in the premium version:

* Image swatches
* Button (multi selectable)
* Swatches (multi selectable)
* Date picker
* Time picker
* File Upload

**Group Separate Products**

Similar to “related products”, you will be able to easily use an existing product as another product’s swatch or option. For instance, you can add “custom stickers” product to a range of “bag” products. You can add “matched cap” to a “baseball t-shirt” or something like that.

### 🔑 HOW IT WORKS

Each field type comes with various elements to help you enhance the extra product options:

* Required field: Make the customer have to select an option or enter the information so it can be passed through in the order (Free)
* Placeholder: Add help text or expected value to be entered in the field (Free)
* Set as default: Enable a specific option value to be selected upon product page load (Free)
* Custom image: Use uploaded swatch image to show on product featured image (Premium-only)
* File upload: Add a single or multiple file uploads, make file uploads mandatory or optional, and many other options.
* File upload: Allow specific file formats like PNG, JPG, PDF, DOC, XLS, etc.

About my needsOnline retailer where I sell products that I make in house. These are anodised then coloured to whatever people want. I needed a swatch with a multiple selection ability so if people want six extra colours they can have it and if they want one extra it’s no bother. The cost of these extra’s needed to be added. If I did this without this plugin I would have to have six lines of swatches or worse the dreaded drop-downs. Also would need about 1000 product permutations in the back end.YayExtra
This fits the bill perfect. I had to upgrade to pro but it’s cheap and I tested the free out before hand for an hour to see how it went. So I now have three swatches. Two ‘single option’ swatches for base colour and first free colour. Then I have an 8 colour swatch where people can add whatever they want. As they add it adds a sub-total of the extras and updates the full cost price. There is conditional logic for this so it makes it do whatever I want. Perfect. As a bonus I even added a notes section. Then my customers can add a description of what they want and other things. I’m also thinking of adding an image upload too incase they want me to use that as inspiration. All can be done through this.Why it’s good
Saves me having to set up infinite variations and have a few plugins when one will do. Literally saves so much time and effort.ImprovementsThey could improve the ease at which you upgrade from free to pro. I’ve notified them of this but it’s clunky. In the free plugin it says add your license key to this field but there’s no field. Turns out you download the pro plugin and upload it as a zip. Then it has that field. SupportSo far so good. he above issue they responded too and also an issue where the sub-totals and totals were interfering with the ‘add quantity’ button and numerical selector. They logged in and sorted that within 20 mins. So all in all it’s doing what I want and you can’t ask for more. I’ve only had it two days but if the support stays as it is now I’m not even worried if any thing happens. Keep up the good work Yaycommerce!
