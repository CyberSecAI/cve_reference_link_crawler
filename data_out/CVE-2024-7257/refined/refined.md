  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing file type validation in the `handle_upload_file` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files to the affected server, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted request to the vulnerable `handle_upload_file` function to upload malicious files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit this vulnerability over the network."
