- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the boundary of a buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the user open a crafted file using a vulnerable version of Adobe InDesign.
