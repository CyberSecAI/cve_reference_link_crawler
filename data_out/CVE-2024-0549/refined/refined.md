{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of file paths, specifically in the `system.js` and `index.js` files. The code uses `path.normalize` and replaces `../` sequences but fails to handle edge cases allowing directory traversal",
      "Weaknesses": "Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of file paths.",
       "Impact": "An attacker could potentially access arbitrary files on the server, possibly including sensitive data or configuration files. An attacker could overwrite or delete existing files using the exposed functionality.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP requests to the `/system/data-exports/:filename` endpoint. By manipulating the `filename` parameter, an attacker can attempt to access files outside of the intended export directory.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
