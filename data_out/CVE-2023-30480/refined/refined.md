Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the Educenter WordPress theme. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization mechanisms, which allows unauthorized users to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is described as varying case by case. The document indicates a general potential for unprivileged users to execute privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable function within the Educenter theme that lacks proper access control checks.
*   The attacker would need to be a subscriber level user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered subscriber on a WordPress site using the vulnerable Educenter theme (versions <= 1.5.5). No other special capabilities appear to be needed.
