Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing appointment details in the `view-appointment-detail.php` file within the Doctor Appointment Management System. The `editid` parameter, used to specify the appointment to be viewed, is directly used without verifying if the user is authorized to access that appointment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the `editid` parameter from the URL to access appointment details without verifying the user's permissions, allowing an attacker to access and manipulate other user's appointments by simply changing the `editid` value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive appointment details, including patient names, contact information, appointment dates, times, doctor details, and messages.
*   **Manipulation of Appointments:** Attackers can modify or cancel appointments, disrupting the system and potentially harming both patients and doctors.
*   **Privacy Compromise:** Sensitive user data is exposed, violating user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the `editid` parameter in the URL of the `view-appointment-detail.php` page to access other appointments.
*  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker without authentication, as no session control is mentioned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate URL parameters.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the web application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the PHPGurukul Doctor Appointment Management System, version 1.0.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the vulnerability is provided.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `http://localhost/Doctor-Appointment-System_PHP/dams/doctor/view-appointment-detail.php`.
* The attacker can view, edit and cancel appointments by manipulating the `editid` parameter.
