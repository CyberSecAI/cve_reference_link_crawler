* A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by visiting a URL such as <http://localhost/Doctor-Appointment-System_PHP/dams/doctor/view-appointment-detail.php?editid=10>, where the "editid" parameter specifies the unique identifier of the appointment to be viewed. However, this parameter can be manipulated by the user without proper authorization or session control.
* For instance, an attacker can alter this parameter to access details of different appointments, such as editid=11, editid=12, and so on. This allows the application to display appointment details assigned to different doctors without proper authorization controls.
* Furthermore, the attacker can use this page to edit or cancel appointment details, posing a significant security risk and potentially compromising the privacy of users' sensitive information.

### Impact:

* Exploitation of this vulnerability can seriously compromise the privacy of application users. A malicious attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive user information, manipulate it, or even delete it, resulting in significant harm.
