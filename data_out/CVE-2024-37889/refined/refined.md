Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37889:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `edit_invoice` function within the `MyFinances/backend/api/invoices/edit.py` file. Specifically, the function was not properly verifying if the user attempting to access/edit an invoice had the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `edit_invoice` function takes an `invoice_id` parameter, and an attacker can manipulate this parameter to access invoices belonging to other users.
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The application failed to verify if the logged-in user had the right to access or modify the specified invoice, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially access the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data of other users by gaining unauthorized access to their invoices.
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could view and potentially modify invoice data belonging to other users.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the edit invoice functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `invoice_id` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by MatthewLaitinen.
- The vulnerable code exists in `backend/views/core/invoices/edit.py` in the `edit_invoice` function.
- The fix involves adding permission checks in the `edit_invoice` function to verify if the user has the required authorization.
- The patched version is 0.4.6, whereas versions prior to 0.3.0 are affected.
- The CVSS score is 6.5 which is considered Moderate.
