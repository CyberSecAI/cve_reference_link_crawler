# Unauthorized Access to Other Customer Data

Moderate

[TreyWW](/TreyWW)

GHSA-4884-3gvp-3wj2
Jun 14, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.3.0

## Patched versions

>= 0.4.6

## Description

### Summary

I have found a way to access other customer invoices while signed in as a user. This method allows an actor to access PII and financial information from another account.

### Details

I am suspect that the edit\_invoice function in MyFinances/backend/api/invoices/edit.py is taking a parameter and not conducting an authorization check; allowing to unauthorized access to another invoice.

### PoC

1. Create two users
2. Create invoices for each user (simulating the app as normal, invoice 1 and 2)
3. While signed in as a user, navigate to invoices
4. Click the ellipses under actions, click edit
5. In the proxy there is a query as follows:

   GET /dashboard/invoices/2/edit/ HTTP/1.1

   I can change this integer (2, which I own) to 1, it exists I have access to the invoice from another user. In my case it was the other user I created. I am not signed into an account which owns invoice 1.

### Impact

Any customer that has an invoice may have their invoice accessed from another account.

I ran this app locally on my machine following the instructions in GitHub.

Please let me know if you have other questions. I am an application security professional by profession and I would be open to cooperate more moving forward!

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
