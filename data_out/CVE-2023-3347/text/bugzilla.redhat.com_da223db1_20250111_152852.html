This flaw allows an attacker to perform attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, by intercepting the network traffic and modifying the SMB2 messages between client and server, affecting the integrity of the data. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |
