- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of a check for recursively defined objects within the OPC UA protocol implementation in KEPServerEX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). The software does not implement a check to prevent processing of recursively defined objects sent over the OPC UA protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a stack overflow, causing the affected device to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted malicious message containing a recursively defined object via the OPC UA protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication. Low attack complexity is required.
