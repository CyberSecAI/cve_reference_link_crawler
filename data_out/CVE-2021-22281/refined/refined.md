- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in how B&R Automation Studio handles project files during import. The vulnerability is due to the application not properly sanitizing filenames within the project archive, allowing specially crafted filenames to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to a Zip Slip vulnerability, which is a type of directory traversal vulnerability that occurs when extracting files from an archive. The vulnerability exists because the application does not validate or sanitize filenames before writing extracted files to disk.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to write or modify files on the local file system with the privileges of the B&R Automation Studio user. This could potentially allow the attacker to overwrite critical system files, introduce malicious software, or compromise the integrity of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using crafted B&R Automation Studio project files that contain directory traversal filenames. By opening such a crafted project in B&R Automation Studio, the application attempts to write the extracted files to the specified locations in the crafted filenames, potentially overwriting or adding malicious files to arbitrary locations on the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a B&R Automation Studio project file. The attacker does not require authentication, however, they need the victim to open the crafted project file in Automation Studio. The attacker also needs to know where they want to write files.
