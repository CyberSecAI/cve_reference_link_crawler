{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization when handling file uploads. Specifically, the 'controller.php' file directly uses the '$_FILES' variable to determine the storage location of the uploaded file, without any checks or cleaning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Lack of sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can upload arbitrary files, which may lead to file overwrite, file injection, directory traversal attacks, and denial of service attacks. Remote code execution (RCE) is also possible if the uploaded file contains malicious code (e.g., a PHP script) and the web server is configured to execute it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to the 'controller.php' file, sending a multipart/form-data request with a malicious file in the 'image' parameter."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted. No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided context, indicating that this could potentially be an anonymous attack vector."
