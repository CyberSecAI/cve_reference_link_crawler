The provided content describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in Bludit CMS version 4.0.0, which is assigned CVE-2023-24674.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks when updating user profiles. Specifically, the application does not prevent a user with author permissions from modifying their own role to "admin" via a crafted PUT request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper authorization checks during user profile updates.
- Inability to prevent modification of user roles.
- Reliance on client-side information for privilege assignment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged user with author permissions can escalate their privileges to admin.
- The attacker can gain full control over the Bludit CMS application.
- The attacker can perform actions that are normally reserved for admin users, such as modifying settings, managing users, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs to have a valid user account with author permissions on the Bludit CMS application.
- The attacker must intercept the request when saving the user profile.
- The attacker needs to modify the intercepted PUT request to include the parameter “role”:admin”.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A low-privileged user account with author permissions on the Bludit CMS application.
- Ability to intercept HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
- Ability to modify HTTP requests to include specific parameters.
