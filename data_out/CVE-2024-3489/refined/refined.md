Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Exclusive Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize the "Countdown Expired Title" before rendering it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into the "Countdown Expired Title" field and subsequently executed when a page containing the countdown timer is viewed by a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the vulnerable field. When a user visits a page displaying the countdown timer with the malicious title, the injected script will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Configuration:** An authenticated user with Contributor or higher privileges can insert a malicious script within the "Countdown Expired Title" field of the countdown timer settings via the plugin's interface. The stored script will then be executed when the timer expires.
*   **User Interaction:** The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into viewing a page with a crafted countdown timer title, or by tricking an admin into setting up a malicious title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to modify the countdown timer settings and inject the malicious script.
*   **Social Engineering (potentially):** In some cases, tricking an admin into setting up a malicious title or a user to click a link to a page with a malicious title may be necessary.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides within the `countdown-timer.php` file of the plugin, specifically within the handling of the "Countdown Expired Title."
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.6.9.4.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.9.5 and newer.
