- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in the web page. Specifically, the Identify Provider name field in FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands within the context of a user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed via the Identify Provider name field in the WebUI of the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to inject malicious script-related HTML tags into the vulnerable field. It is not explicitly stated if this field is accessible to unauthenticated users but given the CVSS score of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N, it seems like no special privileges are needed and that the attack can be performed remotely.
