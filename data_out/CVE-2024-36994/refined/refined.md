Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36994:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper validation and escaping of user-supplied input within the "ping" URL attribute and the "url" parameter in Splunk Web. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected and persistently stored within Splunk's dashboard elements (specifically Views and Splunk Web Bulletin Messages).
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs.
- **Insufficient Output Encoding:** Outputted URLs are not properly encoded, enabling the execution of injected JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized JavaScript execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of other users accessing the affected Splunk instance.
- **Potential for data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions:** Executing malicious JavaScript can potentially lead to a variety of harmful outcomes, such as session hijacking, data exfiltration, or modification of web content.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability itself can be exploited by a low-privileged user, it could be leveraged to escalate privileges indirectly. An attacker can inject code that could be executed by users with higher permissions.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** While not directly stated as part of CVE-2024-36994, the detection content notes that external URLs in dashboards can cause SSRF from the `/data/ui/views` endpoint. This might be related because an attacker can inject a malicious URL.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted Views and Splunk Web Bulletin Messages:** An attacker can craft a malicious payload using the "ping" URL attribute or the "url" parameter within a Splunk View or bulletin message.
- **Targeting specific users:** When another user opens the dashboard containing the injected malicious payload, their browser will execute the injected JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Low-privileged user:** The attacker does not need "admin" or "power" roles to exploit the vulnerability, making it easier to access and exploit.
- **Ability to create/modify dashboards:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify Splunk dashboards and Views to inject the malicious payload.
- **Target users access the malicious dashboard:**  The XSS payload will be executed when the victim user accesses the dashboard/View containing the exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory lists specific affected versions of Splunk Enterprise and Cloud Platform.
- Mitigations include disabling Splunk Web, and upgrading to the patched versions.
- Splunk provides a detection search to identify potential exploitation attempts.
- The advisory includes a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 (Medium).
