# Detection: Splunk XSS Via External Urls in Dashboards SSRF

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: b0a67520-ae82-4cf6-b04e-9f6cce56830d
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This is a hunting search that provides elements to find possible dashboards created with external URL references in order to elicit Server Side Request Forgery from /data/ui/views endpoint.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_web` user=* uri_path="/*/manager/permissions/launcher/data/ui/views/*" file=*
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip user file host method uri_path uri_query
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_xss_via_external_urls_in_dashboards_ssrf_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_xss\_via\_external\_urls\_in\_dashboards\_ssrf\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_xss_via_external_urls_in_dashboards_ssrf_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and requires an operator to search for specific indicators of Server Side Request Forgery attack against /data/ui/views. It is not possible to grab display the payloads of such requests, so this search provides users, ip addresses, requests, files, and queries that may indicate malicious intent. There will be false positives.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible SSRF attack from $clientip$ | 5 | 10 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.

# Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Dashboard Elements

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2024-0714

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2024-36994](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36994)

**Published:** 2024-07-01

**Last Update:** 2024-07-01

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 5.4, Medium

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** VULN-15625

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin” or “power” Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through a View and Splunk Web Bulletin Messages that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user.

The “ping” URL attribute and the “url” parameter do not properly validate user input. The attribute and parameter are not properly escaped, which could lead to the Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) exploit.

## Solution

Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10, or higher.

Splunk is performing upgrades on Splunk Cloud Platform instances as part of Routine Maintenance for customers, as described in the Splunk Cloud Platform Maintenance Policy. In the meantime, Splunk is actively monitoring for potential issues that could arise from this vulnerability.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.2 | Splunk Web | 9.2.0 to 9.2.1 | 9.2.2 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.1 | Splunk Web | 9.1.0 to 9.1.4 | 9.1.5 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.9 | 9.0.10 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2312 | Splunk Web | Below 9.1.2312.200 | 9.1.2312.200 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform | 9.1.2308 | Splunk Web | Below 9.1.2308.207 | 9.1.2308.207 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

The vulnerability affects instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) enabled, turning Splunk Web off is a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on disabling Splunk Web.

## Detections

* [Splunk xss via external urls in dashboards ssrf](https://research.splunk.com/application/b0a67520-ae82-4cf6-b04e-9f6cce56830d)

## Severity

Splunk rates this vulnerability as 5.4, Medium, with a CVSSv3.1 vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there should be no impact and the severity would be informational.
