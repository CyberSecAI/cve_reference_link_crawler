# Detection: Splunk XSS Via External Urls in Dashboards SSRF

Updated Date: 2024-10-17
ID: b0a67520-ae82-4cf6-b04e-9f6cce56830d
Author: Rod Soto, Chase Franklin
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

This is a hunting search that provides elements to find possible dashboards created with external URL references in order to elicit Server Side Request Forgery from /data/ui/views endpoint.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_web` user=* uri_path="/*/manager/permissions/launcher/data/ui/views/*" file=*
2| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by clientip user file host method uri_path uri_query
3| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
4| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
5| `splunk_xss_via_external_urls_in_dashboards_ssrf_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [security\_content\_ctime](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/security_content_ctime.yml) | `convert timeformat="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S" ctime($field$)` |
| splunk\_xss\_via\_external\_urls\_in\_dashboards\_ssrf\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_xss_via_external_urls_in_dashboards_ssrf_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

Requires access to internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This is a hunting search and requires an operator to search for specific indicators of Server Side Request Forgery attack against /data/ui/views. It is not possible to grab display the payloads of such requests, so this search provides users, ip addresses, requests, files, and queries that may indicate malicious intent. There will be false positives.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible SSRF attack from $clientip$ | 5 | 10 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
