**Affected plugin:
[`fortify`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify)**

**Description:**

Fortify Plugin 22.1.38 and earlier does not escape the error message for a form validation method.
This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

|  | Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a [security hardening](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.263/#formvalidation) for form validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be injected. |
| --- | --- |

Fortify Plugin 22.2.39 removes HTML tags from the error message.

I strongly recommend that Jenkins add the following:

- Documentation recommending that Jenkins _not_ be exposed to the public
  Internet, due to its very large attack surface.

- A configuration option to disable all plugins with known
  vulnerabilities.

- A process for removing plugins whose maintainers do not resolve
  security vulnerabilities reasonably quickly.
