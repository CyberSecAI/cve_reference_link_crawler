| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2253034#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2023-12-05 18:06:29 UTC  ``` If the Unix GC's deletion of an SKB races with unix_stream_read_generic() on the socket that the SKB was queued up on, we get a race condition, leading to UAF, because it is supposed to be impossible to run these operations in parallel on the same socket:   - unix_stream_read_generic() assumes that `mutex_lock(&u->iolock)` protects    `sk->sk_receive_queue` against element removal, so it holds a pointer to an    SKB on the `sk->sk_receive_queue` without any other protection  - scan_inflight() only takes `spin_lock(&x->sk_receive_queue.lock)` when    stealing SKBs from the `sk_receive_queue`   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2253034#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-30 10:14:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:2394 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2394)   ``` |  |
