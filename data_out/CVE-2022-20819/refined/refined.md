- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to improper enforcement of administrative privilege levels for sensitive data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control, specifically related to read-only administrative privileges, allows access to sensitive data through the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can collect sensitive information about the system configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited remotely via the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with read-only privileges to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco ISE device.
