This vulnerability exists because administrative privilege levels for sensitive data are not properly enforced. An attacker with *read-only* privileges for the web-based management interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information about the system configuration.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
