Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input sanitization when adding scheduled tasks in the maccms10 software. Specifically, the application allows users to input arbitrary JavaScript code in the scheduled task configuration. This injected code is then stored and executed in the context of other users' sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when the page is viewed by other users, including administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stealing sensitive information of logged-in users, such as session cookies.
- Potentially allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Add a scheduled task" functionality within the maccms10 administration panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the maccms10 software to create/edit scheduled tasks.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "add a schedule task" function.
- Knowledge of how to write malicious Javascript code.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported against version v2024.1000.4040 of maccms10.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code includes `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` to demonstrate stealing cookies and `<script>alert(1)</script>` as a secondary example.
- The vulnerability was marked as completed and fixed in commit `b1e5fee` on Nov 26, 2024.
