Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `admin/login.php` file of the "social-media-skeleton" application.
*   The application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `email` and `password` POST parameters into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core vulnerability is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability. The code concatenates user-provided input directly into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Improper Authorization:** The advisory also mentions "Improper authorization" as a "pervasive problem throughout this application." However, the primary focus of this report is on the SQLi.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The SQL injection is described as leading "indirectly to RCE," which suggests that through a UNION-based SQL injection, the attacker can manipulate the database to achieve code execution.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The CVSS metrics indicate a high impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability, meaning successful exploitation could result in a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin/login.php` file with malicious SQL code in the `email` and `password` fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any prior credentials or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker can execute the attack without any user interaction.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploitation is considered low complexity, meaning the attack is relatively easy to perform.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in version 1.0.0 of the application and is fixed in version 1.0.1.
*   The fix involves using `mysqli_real_escape_string` to sanitize the user inputs before they are included in the SQL query.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Michael Blunt.

The provided commit diff shows the fix. The lines `mysqli_real_escape_string` were added to sanitize the POST variables before being used in the sql query.
