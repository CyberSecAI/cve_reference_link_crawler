# Pre-Auth SQLi leading to RCE in Social Media Skeleton v1.0 in fobybus/social-media-skeleton

Critical

[fobybus](/fobybus)
published
GHSA-857x-p6fq-mgfh
Aug 3, 2023

## Package

admin/login.php

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

SQL injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. This particular SQLi vulnerability allows UNION based injections, which indirectly leads to RCE.

Improper authorization in a web application undermines its security by exposing sensitive functionalities and resources to unauthorized users. This particular authorization vulnerability allows an unauthorized user to access this resource. Improper authorization is a pervasive problem throughout this application.

The affected script takes a value via a POST request and eventually concatenates it in a SQL query. admin/login.php line 4-5

$uemail=$\_POST["email"];

$upass=$\_POST["password"];

This value is parsed as an array which can be manipulated to contain a malicious payload sell\_return.php lines 8-9

$query="select \* from admin where email='$uemail' and password='$upass'";

$result=mysqli\_query($dbcon,$query);

Affected URL/Area

/social-media-skeleton/admin/login.php

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
