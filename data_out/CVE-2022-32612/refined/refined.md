- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization ('race condition') in vcu.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A race condition in the vcu (video codec unit) that leads to a use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered locally by an attacker. No user interaction is required. System execution privileges are needed
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device, likely needing some system privileges to trigger the specific code.

The vulnerability is present in multiple chipsets by MediaTek and affects Android versions 11.0, 12.0 and 13.0.
