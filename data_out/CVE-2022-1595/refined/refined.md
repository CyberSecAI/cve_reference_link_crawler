- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin leaks the secret login URL due to a crafted request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated secret URL disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the secret login URL, potentially bypassing security measures intended to hide the login page.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `wp-login.php` endpoint with a specific cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
