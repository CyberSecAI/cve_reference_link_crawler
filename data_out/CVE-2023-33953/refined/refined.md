      "cve_id": "CVE-2023-33953",
      "description": "Google identified three new vulnerabilities in the gRPC C ++ implementation. These will be published soon publicly as CVE-2023-1428, CVE-2023-32731 and CVE-2023-32732. In April, we identified two vulnerabilities in 1.53 and 1.54 releases. One was a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation and the other was a remote data exfiltration vulnerability. These have been fixed in 1.53.1, 1.54.2 and later releases. Previously in March, our internal teams discovered a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation while performing routine fuzzing activities. It was found in the gRPC 1.52 release, and has been fixed in the 1.52.2 and 1.53 releases.",
      "root_cause": "A Denial-of-Service vulnerability exists in gRPC's C++ implementation due to specially crafted requests that can cause a termination of the connection between a proxy and a backend or lead to a crash impacting a server. Additionally a remote data exfiltration vulnerability exists due to desynchronization in the HPACK table because of header size limitations can lead to proxy backends leaking header data from other clients connected to a proxy.",

      "impact": "Specially crafted requests can cause a termination of connection between a proxy and a backend. Parsing some specifically formed requests can lead to a crash impacting a server. Desynchronisation in the HPACK table due to header size limitations can lead to proxy backends leaking header data from other clients connected to a proxy.",

        "Specially crafted requests sent to gRPC servers."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected service, that can trigger the vulnerable code path."
