Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-9441:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A near-null pointer dereference within the `do_refill` function in `table.c` when processing a malformed `table_alt` HTML tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Near-null pointer dereference.
- The code attempts to access a `table` structure via a pointer `t` which is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault (segfault) leading to a crash.
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition as the application terminates unexpectedly.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can craft a malicious HTML file that includes a malformed `table_alt` tag to trigger the vulnerability.
- The crafted HTML file is loaded/rendered using w3m, leading to the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide the crafted HTML file as an input to w3m.
- This can be achieved by tricking the user to load the malicious page using the vulnerable w3m browser.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue arises specifically in `do_refill` function located in table.c, line 768.
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `int limit = tbl->tables[id].indent + t->total_width;`
- During a specific input scenario involving a malformed `table_alt` tag, the variable `t` which is of type `struct table *` is NULL.
- Accessing `t->total_width` results in a near-null pointer dereference.
- The input that triggers this vulnerability is  `<table><listing><table_alt tid=0></listing<table>`
- The fix involves preventing the dereference of the null pointer.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with afl-fuzz.
- The issue is tracked as issue #24 on the w3m github repository.
- The vulnerability is classified as "normal" severity, and "remote" exploitable by Gentoo.
- The issue was fixed by commit `a6257663824c63abb3c62c4dd62455fe6f63d958` and also commit `63e5fe1fc4a875e89942c0ebe068e717381cc78f`.
