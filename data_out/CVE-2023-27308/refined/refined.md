**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper buffer restrictions in some Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) DCH drivers for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability stems from how the driver handles buffer restrictions, specifically, insufficient limitations or checks leading to a potential buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to achieve escalation of privilege. This means an attacker could gain higher privileges than they should have on the system, potentially leading to complete control of the system.
*   The impact also includes potential modification of data (Integrity) and a partial loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access is required, meaning the attacker must have access to the machine or virtual machine they wish to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be a privileged user.
*   The attacker must have local access to the target machine.

**Affected Products:**
*   Intel(R) Thunderbolt(TM) DCH drivers for Windows before version 88.

**CVSS Score:**
*  4.6 Medium

**CVSS Vector:**
*  CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L
