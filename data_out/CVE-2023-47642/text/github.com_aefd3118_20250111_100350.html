This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

CVE-2023-47642: Invalid metadata access for formerly subscribed streams.

```
It was discovered by the Zulip development team that active users who
had previously been subscribed to a stream incorrectly continued being
able to use the Zulip API to access metadata for that stream. As a
result, users who had been removed from a stream, but still had an
account in the organization, could still view metadata for that
stream (including the stream name, description, settings, and an email
address used to send emails into the stream via the incoming email
integration). This potentially allowed users to see changes to a
streamâ€™s metadata after they had lost access to the stream.

This bug was present in all Zulip releases prior to today's Zulip
Server 7.5.
