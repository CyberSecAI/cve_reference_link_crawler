Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Zulip API allowing users who were previously subscribed to a stream to continue accessing its metadata even after being unsubscribed. This was due to a lack of proper access control checks when retrieving stream metadata for users who had been removed from a stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The system failed to verify if a user was still authorized to access stream metadata before providing it via the API.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Users who had been removed from a stream could still retrieve sensitive information about the stream through the API, including:
    *   Stream name
    *   Stream description
    *   Stream settings
    *   Email address used for incoming email integration

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Former stream members could potentially access and view changes to a stream's metadata after their access should have been revoked. This could reveal confidential information regarding the stream.
*   **Limited Impact:** The vulnerability does not allow for modification of data or disruption of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (API):** The vulnerability is exploited through the Zulip API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing User Account:** The attacker must have an active account within the organization using Zulip.
*   **Previous Subscription:** The attacker must have been previously subscribed to the targeted stream.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the Zulip server.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low user privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affected all Zulip server releases from 1.3.0 through 7.4
*   The issue was resolved in Zulip Server 7.5.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

This vulnerability is related to the `zerver/lib/subscription_info.py` file, which has been updated to implement a proper access check function `has_metadata_access_to_previously_subscribed_stream`. Also, code related to events was modified in `zerver/lib/events.py` to handle unsubscribed streams properly.
