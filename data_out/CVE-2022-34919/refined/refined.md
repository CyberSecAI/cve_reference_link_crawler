Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the 'Classic' interface of the Contensis Content Management System, specifically how it handles file uploads and approvals.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The system allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.
-   **Bypass of File Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows modification of the content type to bypass file restrictions during the approval process. Specifically, an ASPX file can be disguised as an HTML document to allow its upload.
-   **Lack of proper file type validation:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and approving a malicious ASPX file (webshell), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the web server.
-   **Full server compromise**: With remote code execution, the attacker can compromise the server, and potentially other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is carried out through specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/REST/UI/Wizards/CreateContent/UploadFile` and `/REST/UI/Wizards/CreateContent/CreateContent` endpoints.
-   **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to upload the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Contensis instance.
-   **Knowledge of API endpoints**: The attacker needs to know the target API endpoints.
-   **Ability to craft HTTP POST requests**: The attacker must be able to generate the necessary POST requests to upload and approve the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered in March 2022 and patched by Zengenti on April 8, 2022.
- The provided content includes a step-by-step guide to reproduce the vulnerability, including the specific API endpoints and parameters.
- The attacker must first upload the malicious file with an initial POST request, and then approve the file in a second POST request with a modified content type to circumvent file type restrictions.
- The uploaded webshell becomes accessible on both the 'preview' and 'live' domains.
