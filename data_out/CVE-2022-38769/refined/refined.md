- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access control in the mobile application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The mobile application returns cleartext passwords upon successful login.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can fetch cleartext passwords, potentially leading to account compromise and further unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a successful login request to the mobile application's API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send successful login requests to the affected mobile application.
