Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetAutoPing` function of the Tenda i21 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `formSetAutoPing` function takes `ping1` and `ping2` parameters from a POST request.
- These parameters are copied into the `auto_ping_ip` buffer using `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.
- User-controlled input for `ping1` and `ping2` allows for arbitrary data to be written to the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a stack overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite the return address and gain control of the program's execution flow. This could result in arbitrary code execution on the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to the router's web interface with a specially crafted payload for the `ping1` and/or `ping2` parameters is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. This implies that the attacker must have network access to the router, potentially from a local network or via remote access if the web interface is exposed to the internet.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the i21 V1.0.0.14(4656) firmware version.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by sending a POST request with an overly long string as the `ping1` parameter.
- The `sprintf(auto_ping_ip, "%s;%s", ip1, ip2);` is the vulnerable line of code in the function.
