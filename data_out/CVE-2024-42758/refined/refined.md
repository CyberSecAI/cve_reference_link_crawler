The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42758.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the indexmenu plugin for DokuWiki not sanitizing user-supplied data before inserting it into the DOM. Specifically, the `fill`, `contextmenu`, and `arrconcat` functions in `indexmenu.js` and `contextmenu.js` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows malicious scripts to be injected and executed within the context of the user's browser.
    - The `fill` method fails to sanitize node data before inserting it into the DOM.
    - The `contextmenu` method constructs HTML for the menu without sanitizing node names or other content.
    - The `arrconcat` function uses `eval(entry[1])` to evaluate JavaScript code and inserts HTML using `innerHTML` without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** The injected scripts are stored within the DokuWiki pages (.txt files) due to DokuWiki's architecture, leading to persistent XSS attacks that affect other users who view the compromised pages.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The use of `eval()` allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker inputs a malicious XSS payload while creating or editing a DokuWiki page.
- When other users access this compromised page, the XSS payload is executed in their browsers

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit DokuWiki pages.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges, just the ability to inject the malicious javascript.
