{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `DetranCLI` binary uses `sprintf` to construct strings based on user-provided input without proper size validation, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially-crafted network packets to the vulnerable router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a sequence of requests to the device. This likely requires a privileged network position or successful authentication to the router management interface."
