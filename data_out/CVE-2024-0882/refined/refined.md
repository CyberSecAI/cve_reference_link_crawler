{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The universal download interface does not filter directory jump characters (../)",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file download vulnerability due to insufficient input validation on file paths, specifically not sanitizing directory traversal characters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download any system file by constructing a specified path, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive data like the /etc/passwd file.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious request to the file download interface with directory traversal sequences (../) in the file path parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged into the system to exploit the vulnerability."
