Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2015-5467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `yii\web\ViewAction` class. It allows the execution of arbitrary PHP files by passing a relative path via the `view` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary PHP File Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute any PHP file on the server's disk by manipulating the `view` parameter. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise. This could result in data theft, modification, or denial of service.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Due to the ability to execute any PHP file, the attacker can achieve full control over the web server and potentially other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulation of the `view` parameter in an HTTP request directed to the affected `ViewAction`. By supplying a relative path to a PHP file, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Yii application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `ViewAction` and the vulnerable `view` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed, which is why the Yii team released a patch (Yii 2.0.5) immediately after the issue was made public.
- The patch is described as safe, meaning it only addresses the security issue and should not break existing functionality.
