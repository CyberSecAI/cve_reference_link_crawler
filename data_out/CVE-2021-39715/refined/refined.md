Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-39715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how memory areas are dumped when debugging on arm64 Android devices. The commit message indicates a formatting issue when displaying memory regions around registers. Specifically, function names and offsets were not being displayed according to upstream standards when looking into running memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** While the provided information doesn't explicitly detail the information leak, it implies that the improper formatting during memory dumps could expose sensitive data about function locations or other internal memory structures. This is classified as an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity. Specifically, an attacker could gain insight into the memory layout and function locations within the system. This can aid in crafting further exploits or understanding the inner workings of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves access to the system's debugging capabilities. This would typically require an attacker to have some level of access or control over the device's debugging tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to trigger the memory dumping functionality with the vulnerability. This typically means:
    *   Having some degree of system-level access, possibly through a debugging interface.
    *   Being able to execute code or trigger specific debug routines that would cause the memory information to be dumped.
*   The attacker does not need to be physically present.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves aligning the memory dump formatting with upstream conventions.
*   The vulnerability was found in the kernel component of Android.
*   The provided links point to the specific commits that fixed the identified issue in the Android Kernel.

In summary, CVE-2021-39715 is an information disclosure vulnerability resulting from improper formatting of memory dumps on arm64 Android devices during debugging. While not directly allowing remote code execution, the information gained could help an attacker in further exploitation.
