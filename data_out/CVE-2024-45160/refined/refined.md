Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45160

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A regression introduced in commit `06d771cb` of LemonLDAP::NG, where the system incorrectly accepts an empty `client_secret` during OIDC client authentication, even when the Relying Party (RP) is not configured as a public client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The vulnerability allows authentication to proceed without a valid client secret when it should be required.
- **Regression:** This is a regression issue, meaning the intended behavior was broken in a newer version.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not properly validate the presence of the `client_secret` when it is required, resulting in the acceptance of an empty value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication if they know the client ID and exploit the vulnerability.
- **Spoofing/Impersonation:** If an attacker can successfully authenticate with an empty `client_secret`, they might be able to impersonate a legitimate client and access protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OIDC Token Endpoint:** The vulnerability occurs at the OpenID Connect token endpoint. An attacker would send a token request to this endpoint.
- **Empty client_secret:** Attackers would exploit this by omitting the client_secret during the token request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the LemonLDAP::NG instance.
- **Known Client ID:** The attacker needs to know the client ID they want to impersonate.
- **Exploitable System:** The targeted LemonLDAP::NG instance must be vulnerable (versions 2.18.0 and later until patched).

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was introduced by commit `06d771cb`, which added a parameter to restrict the OAuth2 token authentication method but inadvertently created this vulnerability.
- The fix for this issue is described as a "regression fix" and is associated with issue #3223 and commit `696f49a0`.
- The commit `236cdfe4` appears to be a unit test commit for the fix of this CVE.
- The issue report includes logs demonstrating the acceptance of the "none" authentication method when it should not be accepted without a valid `client_secret`.

This detailed breakdown clarifies the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how an attacker could exploit it.
