- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user inputs in its widget settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected areas of the website. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects a malicious script via the input fields of the plugin's widgets settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative level access to the WordPress site to be able to add and edit widgets.
