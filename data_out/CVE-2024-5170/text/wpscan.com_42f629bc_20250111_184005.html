## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Logo Manager For Enamad <= 0.7.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Widget

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape in its widgets settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add any of the widgets that the plugin makes available and enter the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` in the input and save.
2. You will see the XSS in the Widget Settings.
