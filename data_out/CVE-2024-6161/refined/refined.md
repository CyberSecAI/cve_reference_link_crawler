Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation within the `get_cache_image` function of the Default Thumbnail Plus WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows uploading files without proper validation of their type. This is a critical security flaw.
- **Missing File Type Validation:**  The `get_cache_image` function does not check the type of the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any type of file to the server.
- **Remote Code Execution (Possible):**  The uploaded files can potentially be used to achieve remote code execution on the server, depending on the file type and server configuration.
- **Full system compromise:** Successful RCE could allow the attacker to gain full control over the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The attack is carried out over the network, typically through HTTP requests.
- **File upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious file through the vulnerable `get_cache_image` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to have an account with at least contributor-level permissions within the WordPress site.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
