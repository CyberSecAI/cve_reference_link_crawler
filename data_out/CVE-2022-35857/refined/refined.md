Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**
- The application uses a fixed, hardcoded key in the `com.kalvin.kvf.common.shiro.ShiroConfig` file. This key is used to encrypt the `rememberMe` parameter in the cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded Encryption Key:** The use of a static, hardcoded key for encryption is a major security flaw. It allows an attacker to easily discover the key by examining the application's source code.
- **Deserialization Vulnerability:** The application utilizes the `commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar` dependency which is known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. This dependency is included in shiro framework.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the deserialization vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `rememberMe` cookie by injecting a specially crafted payload that, when deserialized, leads to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the application's cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate the cookies sent by the application.
- **Knowledge of the hardcoded key:** The attacker needs to find the hardcoded encryption key by examining the source code.
- **Ability to create a malicious payload:** The attacker needs the ability to create a serialized payload that exploits the deserialization vulnerability.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**
- The attacker first needs to login to the application and set the "remember me" flag in order to obtain a valid cookie which can be manipulated.
- The attacker will then extract the encrypted `rememberMe` cookie parameter, and decrypt it using the hardcoded key.
- The attacker must create a payload using `commons-beanutils` and encrypt it with the same hardcoded key.
- Finally the attacker has to replace the original encrypted `rememberMe` parameter with the newly created one. The JSESSIONID cookie should be deleted for the attack to work.
