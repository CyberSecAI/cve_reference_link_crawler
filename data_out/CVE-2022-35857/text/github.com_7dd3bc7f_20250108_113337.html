| The author sets a fixed key in the com.kalvin.kvf.common.shiro.ShiroConfig file and uses this key to encrypt the rememberMe parameter in the cookie. This situation can cause a deserialization attack with very serious consequences. [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75016675/178397308-92b9fdda-b207-4ae3-8cef-8b573afe0770.png) Set up a local environment for attacks. When the attacker logs in and selects remember me, the cookie will have the rememberMe field [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75016675/178397332-70b7b223-4d56-43b3-b90f-12a18f153616.png)  Blast the field and find that the encoded key is 2AvVhdsgUs0FSA3SDFAdag==, which is the same as the one set in the source code  After an audit, I found that the source code contains commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar dependency, which is actually a dependency included in shiro. Using this dependency, it is possible to generate a deserialized payload and then encrypt the payload using the key obtained by blasting. Finally, write this payload after the rememberMe field and attack it. Successful RCE [00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75016675/178397794-162bbe68-8ebb-47c9-8119-80010b98626f.png)  Note that the JSESSIONID in the cookie field should be deleted, otherwise the system will make judgments directly based on the JSESSIONID. |
