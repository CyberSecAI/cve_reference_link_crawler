Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2024-36076:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of `Origin` header validation when establishing WebSocket connections. The SysReptor server does not validate the `Origin` header, which is a crucial part of the browser's same-origin policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSHJ):** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking. This is due to the server's failure to validate the `Origin` header during WebSocket connection establishment.
*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** The server doesn't check the origin of WebSocket connection requests, allowing malicious scripts from other (same-site) domains to initiate WebSocket connections using the victim's session cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized read and write access to a user's personal notes and project notes.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Through the hijacked WebSocket connection, attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data, including personal user notes and project notes.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can not only read but also modify the notes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network, leveraging the WebSocket protocol.
*   **Malicious Same-Site Subdomain:** The attacker must compromise a same-site subdomain to host the malicious script. This is because SysReptor uses `SameSite=Strict` for cookies, limiting cross-site cookie usage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Subdomain:** Attackers must compromise a subdomain within the same site as the vulnerable SysReptor instance (e.g., `evil.example.com` attacking `sysreptor.example.com`).
*   **Logged-In User:** The attack requires a logged-in user on the vulnerable SysReptor instance.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the logged-in user into visiting the compromised subdomain hosting the malicious script.
*   **Optional Project UUID:** To access project notes, attackers need the UUID of the target project.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to SysReptor versions between `2024.28` and `2024.30`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version `2024.40`.
*   The fix includes the introduction of an `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting for request host and origin validation, which is recommended as an additional security measure.
*   The provided exploit code shows a basic example of how the attack can be carried out by initiating a WebSocket connection, capturing messages, and sending them to a Burp Collaborator URL.
*  The provided CVSS score is 6.8 (Moderate), with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`, which highlights the attack's network-based nature, high attack complexity, the need for user interaction, and its potential impact on confidentiality and integrity.
