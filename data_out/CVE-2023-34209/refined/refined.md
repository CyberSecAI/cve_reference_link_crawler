- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive system information within the `create template` function of EasyUse MailHunter Ultimate. Specifically, the absolute path of the system is revealed through an unencrypted VIEWSTATE parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive system information (absolute path) via an unencrypted VIEWSTATE parameter. This falls under CWE-497, which describes the "Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere".
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of exploitation is that a remote authenticated user can obtain the absolute path of the system. This information could be used for further attacks, though the immediate impact is limited to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, requiring network access. An attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attack involves manipulating the `create template` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote user with valid authentication credentials to the EasyUse MailHunter Ultimate application.
