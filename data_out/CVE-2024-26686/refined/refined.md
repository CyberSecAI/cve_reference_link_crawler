Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-26686.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `do_task_stat()` function in the Linux kernel gathers statistics about tasks and their threads/children.  Specifically, it occurs within the `lock_task_sighand()` function which can lead to a hard lockup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Spin lock contention:** The original implementation of `do_task_stat()` could lead to a situation where multiple threads calling the function simultaneously would cause a spin lock with interrupts disabled. This spin lock would occur in O(NR_CPUS * NR_THREADS) time. This was particularly true when the process being examined had a large number of threads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Hard Lockup:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a hard lockup of the system, which can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Concurrent calls to `do_task_stat()`:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a large number of threads concurrently calling the `do_task_stat()` function on a process with a large number of threads. This is typically done through `/proc/<pid>/stat` reads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to trigger `do_task_stat()`:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger the `do_task_stat()` function, which is done by reading a process' `/proc/<pid>/stat`. This could be done locally on the system or potentially remotely if the `/proc` file system is exposed.
- **Ability to create a large number of threads:**  The process being examined needs to have many threads for the vulnerability to be reliably triggered.

**Mitigation:**

The provided patches resolve this vulnerability by using `sig->stats_lock` to gather statistics outside of the `siglock` protected section which would otherwise cause the described spin lock contention. The corrected code is designed to run locklessly when possible by using a sequence lock and RCU read locks to synchronize access to the thread statistics. This change avoids the possibility of the described lockup by reducing the time the spin lock with interrupts disabled is held.
