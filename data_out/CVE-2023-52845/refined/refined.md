{
    "CVE-2023-52845": {
        "Description": "TIPC bearer-related names including link names must be null-terminated strings. If a link name which is not null-terminated is passed through netlink, strstr() and similar functions can cause buffer overrun. This causes the above issue.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of enforcement of null-termination for TIPC bearer-related names, including link names, when passed through netlink. This allows a non-null-terminated string to be processed by functions like `strstr()`, leading to a potential buffer over-read.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a missing null-termination check on input strings when handling TIPC bearer and link names via netlink. This allows the program to read beyond the allocated buffer when using string functions like `strlen` and `strstr` on the non-null-terminated strings.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger an uninitialized memory access leading to a kernel crash. A buffer over-read can also leak potentially sensitive kernel memory information.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a crafted netlink message with a non-null-terminated bearer or link name to the kernel. This can be achieved through a malicious program or a crafted network packet.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send netlink messages to the kernel with specific TIPC attributes to exploit the vulnerability. This would typically require local access or the ability to inject crafted packets to the netlink socket. Privileges to use the netlink interface would be required."
