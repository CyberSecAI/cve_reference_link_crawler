- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `PassageAutoServer.php` page does not properly sanitize or validate the `file` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files outside of the website directory, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a GET request to `PassageAutoServer.php` with a manipulated `file` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the file system structure of the server.
