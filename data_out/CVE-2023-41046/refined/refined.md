Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute Velocity code within a "TextArea" property when its "Content Type" is set to either "VelocityCode" or "VelocityWiki," without the user having the necessary script rights. This occurs because the rendering process for these content types directly executes the provided Velocity code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted Velocity Execution:**  The core weakness is the improper access control over Velocity code execution. Users without script rights can execute Velocity code through specially crafted "TextArea" properties.
*   **Incorrect Context:** Although the code executes with the context of the author, it can still access sensitive data and APIs. This could allow for further privilege escalation, even though privileged APIs directly protected by script rights are not accessible.
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** The intended security model of requiring script rights to execute Velocity is circumvented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can access potentially sensitive information, such as cookies, as demonstrated in the example.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While direct access to privileged APIs is prevented, the access to other data and APIs might allow for indirect privilege escalation.
*   **Potential Security Issues:** Exploiting this vulnerability can expose security issues that are usually only exploitable with script rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of XWiki by manipulating document properties and content types.
*   **Specifically Crafted Content:** The attacker manipulates the content of "TextArea" fields in XWiki documents to include malicious Velocity code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with edit rights to create and modify documents.
*   **No Script Rights:** The attacker *does not* need script rights, which is a key aspect of the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of XWiki:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the XWiki document structure, class editor and object editor as well as how to manipulate the content type of a field.

**Technical Details:**

*   **ContentType:** The vulnerability is triggered by setting the "Content Type" of a "TextArea" to either "VelocityCode" or "VelocityWiki".
*  **VelocityCode Requires XWiki 1.0 syntax:** The "VelocityCode" content type is only executed if the document syntax is set to `xwiki/1.0`, but it does not require the syntax to be installed.
*   **Velocity Execution:** The Velocity code is evaluated directly when the property is displayed via the `bin/get` endpoint.
*   **Context:** The Velocity code executes with the context author, meaning that direct access to script-right-protected APIs isn't granted.
*  **Fix:** The fix includes:
  * Using `AuthorExecutor` to set the correct context author.
  * Checking for script rights and restricted properties before executing the Velocity code.
