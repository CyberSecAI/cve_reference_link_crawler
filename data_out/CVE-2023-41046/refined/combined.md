#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Log in as a user without script right
2. Edit your user profile (or any other document) with the class editor and add a new field of type "TextArea", named "Test" and set "Content Type" to "VelocityCode".
3. Edit the same document with the object editor and add an object of the just created class. Set its content to $request.cookies.
4. Edit the document with the wiki editor and use the developer tools to set the value of the selected document syntax to xwiki/1.0 (no need to have XWiki 1.0 syntax installed, just ignore the errors). Save the document.
5. Open <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/username?xpage=display&property=XWiki.username.Test&type=object where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation and username is your user's name.

**Expected result:**

$request.cookies is displayed.

**Actual result:**

Content similar to [javax.servlet.http.Cookie@2f0535e1, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@3ed6f4f6, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@6eb94904, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@4e4fbe60, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@48632075] is displayed, showing that the Velocity code has been executed. Note that while the Velocity code is executed, it is executed with the correct context author. Therefore, no privileged APIs can be accessed. However, still dangerous data might be accessed and security issues that are only exploitable with script right can be exploited.

This issue is probably very old but I'm setting the affects version to 7.2 as in XWiki 7.2, script right was introduced and thus only since 7.2 script execution without script right can be considered a security issue.

# Velocity execution without script right through VelocityCode and VelocityWiki property

Moderate

[michitux](/michitux)
published
GHSA-m5m2-h6h9-p2c8
Sep 1, 2023

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 7.2, < 14.10.10
>= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.4-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.10.10
15.4-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

It is possible in XWiki to execute Velocity code without having script right by creating an XClass with a property of type "TextArea" and content type "VelocityCode" or "VelocityWiki". For the former, the syntax of the document needs to be set the `xwiki/1.0` (this syntax doesn't need to be installed). In both cases, when adding the property to an object, the Velocity code is executed regardless of the rights of the author of the property (edit right is still required, though). In both cases, the code is executed with the correct context author so no privileged APIs can be accessed. However, Velocity still grants access to otherwise inaccessible data and APIs that could allow further privilege escalation.

At least for "VelocityCode", this behavior is most likely very old but only since XWiki 7.2, script right is a separate right, before that version all users were allowed to execute Velocity and thus this was expected and not a security issue.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.10 and 15.4 RC1.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Log in as a user without script right
2. Edit your user profile (or any other document) with the class editor and add a new field of type "TextArea", named "Test" and set "Content Type" to "VelocityWiki".
3. Edit the same document with the object editor and add an object of the just created class. Set its content to $request.cookies.
4. Open <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/username?xpage=display&property=XWiki.username.Test&type=object where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation and username is your user's name.

**Expected result:**

$request.cookies is displayed.

**Actual result:**

Content similar to [javax.servlet.http.Cookie@2f0535e1, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@3ed6f4f6, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@6eb94904, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@4e4fbe60, javax.servlet.http.Cookie@48632075] is displayed, showing that the Velocity code has been executed. Note that while the Velocity code is executed, it is executed with the correct context author. Therefore, no privileged APIs can be accessed. However, still dangerous data might be accessed and security issues that are only exploitable with script right can be exploited.

This is caused by [~~XWIKI-18222~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18222 "Administration sections are not executed with the right of their author") which introduced the "VelocityWiki" type.
