## Description

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, livemarks: `GHSL-2024-015`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [livemarks](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve this issue. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of this issue with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2024-015` as a reference). See also [this blog post](https://github.blog/2022-04-22-removing-the-stigma-of-a-cve/) written by GitHub's Advisory Curation team which explains what CVEs and advisories are, why they are important to track vulnerabilities and keep downstream users informed, the CVE assigning process, and how they are used to keep open source software secure.

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

The livemarks browser extension is vulnerable to a CSRF attack. A malicious website may be able to coerce the extension to send an authenticated GET request to an arbitrary URL. An authenticated request is a request where the cookies of the browser are sent along with the request.

## Project

livemarks

## Tested Version

v3.6

## Details

### Authenticated CSRF in background.js (`GHSL-2024-015`)

The `subscribe.js` script uses the first parameter from the current URL location as the URL of the RSS feed to subscribe to and checks that the RSS feed is valid XML.

[subscribe.js](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/pages/subscribe/subscribe.js#L52)

```
async function main() {
  const queryString = location.search.substring(1).split("&");
  const feedUrl = decodeURIComponent(queryString[0]);
...
const feed = await browser.runtime.sendMessage({
      msg: "get-feed",
      feedUrl
    });
```

[feed-parser.js](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/shared/feed-parser.js#L5)

```
const FeedParser = {
  fetchXML(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      request.open("GET", url, true);
    const doc = await this.fetchXML(url);
```

`subscribe.js` is accessible by an attacker website due to its use in `subscribe.html`, an HTML page that is declared as a `web_accessible_resource` in `manifest.json`

[manifest.json](https://github.com/nt1m/livemarks/blob/9c5233c82aa2f7c8bac348a08ff52881b00c4f95/manifest.json#L4)

```
"web_accessible_resources": [
    "pages/subscribe/subscribe.html"
  ]
```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation`. A CSRF breaks the integrity of servers running on a private network. A user of the browser extension may have a private server with dangerous functionality, which is assumed to be safe due to network segmentation. Upon receiving an authenticated request instantiated from an attacker, this integrity is broken.

#### Remediation

1. Remove subscribe.html from `web_accessible_resources` or limit its access.

#### Proof of Concept

A leak of the UUID is necessary to exploit this vulnerability, since the extension is for Firefox only. If an attacker can convince the user to install an additional extension with permissions that don't directly allow them to make authenticated requests, for example the management permission, then an attacker may be able to leak the UUID and pivot from the approved permission to CSRF. In this scenario, the attacker would gain the ability to send SameSite cookies because livemarks has permissions for all urls.

Host the following html:

```
<iframe
src="moz-extension://UUID/pages/subscribe/subscribe.html?attacker-supplied.domain>
</iframe>

```

Visit this html page with the livemarks browser extension installed, resulting in the authenticated request to `attacker-supplied.domain`.

## GitHub Security Advisories

We recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for this finding. This also allows you to invite the GHSL team to collaborate and further discuss this finding in private before it is [published](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory).

## Credit

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
