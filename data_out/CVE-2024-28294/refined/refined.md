The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the 'sql' parameter is handled in the `/main_admin.php` page of Limbas. Specifically, when the 'ftid' parameter is missing or not a number, the application uses user-supplied 'sql' parameter to construct SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. The application's response changes based on the SQL condition injected through the 'sql' parameter, allowing attackers to infer information about the database.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input for the 'sql' parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- Direct use of user input in SQL query: The application constructs SQL queries by directly embedding the 'sql' parameter without parameterization or escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can control the application by modifying data within the underlying database.
- Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Attackers can potentially leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `sql` parameter of the `main_admin.php` page, specifically when `action=setup_gtab_ftype&atid=1`. This page is accessible after logging in with an admin account.
- The attacker modifies the `sql` parameter with SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Limbas application to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker can inject SQL code via the `sql` parameter.
