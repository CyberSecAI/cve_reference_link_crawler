- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length buffer within the HTTP server of the Actiontec WCB6200Q router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router within the context of the HTTP server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attacker sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable HTTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected router. Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.
