The provided content relates to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel's s390 architecture, specifically concerning protected and secure keys.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that copies of protected and secure key material were being left on the stack after certain operations within the `pkey_unlocked_ioctl` function, even in cases of errors. Although these keys are not accessible through normal means (clear-key is not accessible), this key material should only be visible to the calling process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive key material (protected and secure keys) to other parts of the kernel or potentially to other processes if not properly cleared from the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker, potentially through another vulnerability or a privileged process, might be able to access the leaked key material from the stack memory.
- **Security Compromise:** Exposed key material could allow an attacker to impersonate a user or application that holds that key or perform other malicious actions that are otherwise impossible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Stack Memory Access:** An attacker would need a way to read the contents of the kernel stack memory of the vulnerable process. This could be accomplished through other vulnerabilities that allow memory leaks or through a privileged process with the capability to inspect memory.
- **Timing:** It is also possible that timing could be a factor for more specific exploits that target these memory regions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access or Memory Leak:** An attacker needs either a privileged position or another vulnerability that allows reading kernel stack memory.
- **Understanding of Kernel Memory Layout:** Knowledge of the kernel memory layout, especially of the stack structure during relevant ioctl calls, is required for a more specific exploit.

The provided patches address this vulnerability by ensuring that all copies of protected and secure keys are wiped from the stack using `memzero_explicit` after their use, even if an error occurs during the operation. Additionally `kfree` is replaced by `kfree_sensitive` for key variables allocated with `kmalloc`.
