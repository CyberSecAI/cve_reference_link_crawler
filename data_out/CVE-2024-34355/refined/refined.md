Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34355

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the history backend module in TYPO3 CMS not properly encoding the output of `BackendUtility::getRecordTitle`. This function returns a string that is only HTML encoded if the `$prep` parameter is set to `true`. When this parameter isn't used, the output is not sanitized before being rendered, leading to an HTML injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML markup into the history backend module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   While Content Security Policy (CSP) headers prevent JavaScript execution, malicious HTML can still be injected, potentially leading to:
    *   UI spoofing/misrepresentation
    *   Phishing attempts (if the injected HTML includes links to external sites)
    *   Other client-side manipulation

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the history backend module of TYPO3 CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid Backend User Account:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to have a valid backend user account, indicating it is not an anonymous access vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** TYPO3 CMS versions 13.0.0 to 13.1.0 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** TYPO3 CMS version 13.1.1 fixes this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 3.5, with the vector string being `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`. This translates to:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Privileges Required: Low
    *   User Interaction: Required
    *   Scope: Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality: None
    *   Integrity: Low
    *   Availability: None
*  **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output)

**Patch Details:**
The fix involves ensuring that the output of `BackendUtility::getRecordTitle` is HTML encoded on render, specifically in the `typo3/sysext/backend/Resources/Private/Partials/RecordHistory/History.html` file. The change replaces `{historyRow.title} ({historyRow.recordTable}:{historyRow.recordUid})` with `{historyRow.title -> f:format.raw()} ({historyRow.recordTable}:{historyRow.recordUid})` to ensure proper escaping.

The provided information clearly relates to CVE-2024-34355, detailing the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the fix.
