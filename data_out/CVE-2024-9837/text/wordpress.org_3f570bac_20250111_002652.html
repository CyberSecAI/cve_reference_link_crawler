It helps to keep your content up-to-date and improve your SEO thus ensuring that your website’s content is always fresh and relevant. With this plugin, you can easily add dynamic current time elements to your website without any coding knowledge.

* This plugin adds the following short codes to your WordPress Blog/Site:

* **[py]** – Stands For [Previous Year] Outputs the previous year (e.g. 2023)
* **[ny]** – Stands For [Next Year] Outputs the next year (e.g. 2025)
* **[today]** – Stands For [Today Full Date] Outputs the Full Date, month and year (e.g. November 09, 1994)
* **[tomorrow]** Stands For Next Day Full Date e.g, (Today is **April 16, 2024** it will show the **April 17, 2024** using simple shortcode **[tomorrow]**)
* **[cd]** – Stands For [Current Date] Outputs the Current Day (e.g. 27)
* **[pd]** – Stands For [Previous day] Outputs the Previous Day (e.g. Thursday)
* **[day]** – Stands For [day] Outputs the Current Day (e.g. Friday)
* **[nd]** – Stands For [Next day] Outputs the Previous Day (e.g. Saturday)
* **[cm]** – Stands For [Current Month] Outputs the Current Month (e.g. December)
* **[nm]** – Stands For [Next Month] Outputs the name of next month (e.g. This month is December when you use given shortcode output must be January)
* **[pm]** – Stands For [Previous Month] Outputs the name of previous month (e.g. This month is December when you use given shortcode output must be November)

### [offset]

* This shortcode will display a previous or future date based on an offset from the current date. Usage: **[offset date=”OFFSET”]**, where **“OFFSET”** is an integer representing the number of days before **(-)** or after **(+)** the current date. Examples:

1. **[offset date=”-1″]** will display the previous date based on the user’s timezone. Example output: **“May 4, 2023”**.
2. **[offset date=”0″]** is equivalent to **[today]** and will display the current date. Example output: **“May 5, 2023”**.
3. **[offset date=”1″]** will display the next date based on the user’s timezone. Example output: **“May 6, 2023”**.
4. **[offset date=”365″]** will display the date one year from the current date based on the user’s timezone. Example output: **“May 5, 2024”**.

  Usage:

  **[cdown\_short date=”mm/dd/yyyy”]:** Displays the countdown in a short format (e.g., “84d, 7h, 26m, 38s”).

  **[countdown date=”mm/dd/yyyy”]:** Displays the countdown in a full format (e.g., “84 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes, 38 seconds”).

**Examples:**

**[cdown\_short date=”12/31/2024″]:** Shows the time remaining until December 31, 2024, in a short format: “84d, 7h, 26m, 38s”.

**[countdown date=”12/31/2024″]:** Shows the time remaining until December 31, 2024, in a detailed format: “84 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes, 38 seconds”.

**[cdown\_short date=”06/01/2025″]:** Displays the time left until June 1, 2025, in a short format.

**[countdown date=”06/01/2025″]:** Displays the time left until June 1, 2025, in a detailed format.

  **[custom\_countdown\_short hours=”value”]:** Countdown in a compact format (e.g., 2d, 5h, 30m, 45s).
