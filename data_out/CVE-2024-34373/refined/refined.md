- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website's input fields or other areas that are not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the capability to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable plugin, which likely requires the privilege of a "contributor" role.
