# BT: Possible to overwrite an existing bond during keys distribution phase when the identity address of the bond is known

Moderate

[ceolin](/ceolin)
published
GHSA-j76f-35mc-4h63
Oct 5, 2021

## Package

zephyr
(west)

## Affected versions

1.14.2, 2.4.0, 2.5.0

## Patched versions

2.6.0

## Description

During the distribution of the identity address information we don’t check for an existing bond with the same identity address.This means that a duplicate entry will be created in RAM while the newest entry will overwrite the existing one in persistent storage.

Due to the duplicate entry in RAM the connection will succeed in pairing, but future reconnections will most likely pick the wrong keys entry, and re-encryption will end with MIC failure during encryption setup.Once the device reboots only the newest bond information will exist.The new bond storage will have the authentication and security level of the newest bond, i.e no security elevation.

Unable to resolve peer RPA and peer initiates new pairing procedure causes two entries in the keys storage with the same identity address.

This results in pairing failure when the bond information is selected on reconnection and wrong LTK causes disconnection with MIC error.

### Reproduce

Local changes to imitate observed behavior, remote has cleared bond and is using a new IRK.

```
diff --git a/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c b/subsys/bluetooth/host/hci_core.c
index 836ea6807d..1f447d93b2 100644

@@ -2594,10 +2594,13 @@ int bt_unpair(uint8_t id, const bt_addr_le_t *addr)
        if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_BT_SMP) &&
            (!addr || !bt_addr_le_cmp(addr, BT_ADDR_LE_ANY))) {
                bt_foreach_bond(id, unpair_remote, &id);
+               bt_rand(&bt_dev.irk[id], 16);

        unpair(id, addr);

        return 0;
}
```

Build shell with:

```
west build tests/bluetooth/shell/ -- -DCONFIG_BT_MAX_PAIRED=4
```

Step 1. Create a bond:

Peripheral shell

```
bt init
bt advertise on
bt oob
<copy oob addr>
<wait for connection>
bt security 2
```

Central shell

```
bt init
bt connect <oob addr>
<wait for pairing complete>
```

Step 2. Reconnect and re-pair with new IRK and RPA

Central shell

```
bt disconnect
bt clear all
bt oob
bt connect <oob addr>
```

Peripheral shell

```
<wait for connection>
bt security 2
bt bonds
<prints two entries with same identity address>
```

Step 3. Reconnect, peripheral will use wrong bond information.

Central shell

```
bt disconnect
bt connect <oob addr>
```

Peripheral shell

```
<wait for connection>
bt security 2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
