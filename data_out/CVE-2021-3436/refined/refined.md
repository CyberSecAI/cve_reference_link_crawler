The content is related to CVE-2021-3436.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that during the distribution of identity address information, the system does not check for an existing bond with the same identity address. This allows a duplicate entry to be created in RAM while the newest entry overwrites the existing one in persistent storage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Creation of duplicate bond entries in RAM.
- Overwriting existing bond information in persistent storage.
- Incorrect key entry selection during reconnection attempts.
- MIC failure during encryption setup.
- Pairing failure due to incorrect LTK.
- Disconnection due to MIC error

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Pairing failures.
- Disconnection due to MIC errors.
- Loss of expected security elevation.
- Reconnection attempts may fail due to the wrong keys being selected, resulting in MIC failures and disconnections

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be within the radio range of the vulnerable device (Bluetooth).
- The attack can be performed by initiating a new pairing procedure using a new IRK and RPA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in radio range of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a new pairing procedure with a new IRK and RPA after an initial bond has been established.
