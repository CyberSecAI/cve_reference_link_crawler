{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mini-app 'Onigiriya-musubee' exposes the 'client secret' in the client-side response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the leaked client secret to acquire a channel access token. This token can then be used to broadcast malicious messages to users of the mini-app, potentially including website links, fraud information, and other harmful content.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by intercepting network traffic, specifically the response from the <https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry> endpoint, which contains the client secret.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic from the Line app when the 'Onigiriya-musubee' mini-app is accessed. This could be achieved through various means such as man-in-the-middle attacks or by having access to the user's device."
