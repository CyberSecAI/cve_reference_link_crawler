{
  "CVE-2023-52498": {
    "description": "It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held. Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one, for example).",
    "root_cause": "The `async_schedule_dev()` function, used for scheduling asynchronous device suspend and resume operations, can execute its argument function synchronously under memory pressure or other conditions. This synchronous execution can lead to deadlocks when the function tries to acquire a mutex already held by the caller. Additionally, executing the function synchronously can disrupt the intended order of device resume callbacks, leading to further issues.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Deadlock",
      "Incorrect ordering of resume callbacks"
     ],
    "impact": "A deadlock during system-wide resume core operations which can lead to system unresponsiveness. Incorrect ordering of resume callbacks might cause device malfunctions or improper operation.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation would require triggering a system resume operation in a low memory or otherwise constrained environment, which is a condition that arises naturally under normal operating conditions. No direct attacker interaction is required.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker does not need any special privileges or capabilities to trigger this vulnerability. The condition is triggered by resource exhaustion (low memory), a typical operating scenario."
