| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8150#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-02-01 17:19:10 UTC  ``` 上报人信息：   - 白家驹 <baijiaju@buaa.edu.cn>   - 北京航空航天大学网络空间安全学院  成因： 在xc4000_get_frequency中，通过*freq = priv->freq_hz + priv->freq_offset读取frequency，没有持有任何锁，但在读取过程中，priv->freq_hz和priv->freq_offset可能被xc4000_set_params并发地进行更新，从而使xc4000_get_frequency读取到了中间值，priv->freq_hz和priv->freq_offset不匹配，返回错误数值甚至整数溢出。  	 危害： xc4000_get_frequency是xc4000驱动接口dvb_tuner_ops的get_frequency项函数，选择xc4000作为tuner的media设备均会受到此漏洞的影响，读取到错误的frequency值，影响相关ioctl；在em28xx等依赖于读取的frequency设置新frequency的设备中，还会导致设置非法frequency，造成设备异常。  选择xc4000作为tuner的media相关ioctl返回错误值溢出值；根据实现的不同，会导致部分设备异常，可以用于拒绝服务攻击。  修复缓解：    -  在xc4000_get_frequency函数中，读取priv->freq_hz和priv->freq_offset时，持有priv->lock mutex锁，阻止xc4000_set_params并发执行进行更新。  补丁已提交给Linux Kernel Media子系统维护者，补丁链接：[https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20231222055030.5237-1-2045gemini@gmail.com/](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20231222055030.5237-1-2045gemini%40gmail.com/)   [https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231222055030.5237-1-2045gemini@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231222055030.5237-1-2045gemini%40gmail.com/) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8150#c1)  Shiloong   admin  2024-03-21 09:54:44 UTC  ``` patch has been queued in linux-next: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?h=next-20240320&id=36d503ad547d1c75758a6fcdbec2806f1b6aeb41> ``` |  |
