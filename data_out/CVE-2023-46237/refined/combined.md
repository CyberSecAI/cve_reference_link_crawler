# Path traversal via unauthenticated endpoint.

Moderate

[0x41c](/0x41c)
published
GHSA-ffp9-rhfm-98c2
Oct 30, 2023

## Package

packages/web/status/getfiles.php
(PHP)

## Affected versions

< 1.5.10

## Patched versions

1.5.10

## Description

### Impact

An endpoint intended to offer limited enumeration abilities to authenticated users was accessible to unauthenticated users. This enabled unauthenticated users to discover files and their respective paths that are visible to the Apache user group.

### Patches

Patched in commit [`68d73740d7d40aee77cfda3fb8199d58bf04f48b`](https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/68d73740d7d40aee77cfda3fb8199d58bf04f48b), and 1.5.10.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
