Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Master Addons for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject scripts that execute when users visit the site. This could lead to:
    - Redirects to malicious websites
    - Display of unwanted advertisements
    - Execution of other malicious HTML payloads
    - Potentially lead to more severe attacks if the attacker is able to inject arbitrary javascript to gain more access.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious scripts into the website using the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script, which in this case seems to be possible by being a contributor to the wordpress site, meaning the attack is not remote, but rather requires a level of access.
