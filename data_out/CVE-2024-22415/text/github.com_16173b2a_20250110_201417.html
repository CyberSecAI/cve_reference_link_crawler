* Add auth decorators, add traversal guard

* Fix mocks resolving most test failures;

`test_listeners` still fails not sure how to fix it

* Address review comments

* add tests for (un)authn'd REST and WebSocket handlers

* Restore old import for 1.x compat, remove a log

* handle advertised jupyter-server 1.x version

* Lint (isort any mypy)

* More tests for paths
