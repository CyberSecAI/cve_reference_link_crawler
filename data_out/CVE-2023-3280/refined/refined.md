- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in a protection mechanism within the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent on Windows devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755) which allows a local user to disable the agent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can disable the Cortex XDR agent, leading to a high impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a Windows device with a vulnerable version of the Cortex XDR agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the Windows system.
