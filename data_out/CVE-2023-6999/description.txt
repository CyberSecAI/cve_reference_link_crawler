The Pods â€“ Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Exxecution via shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10 (with the exception of 2.7.31.2, 2.8.23.2, 2.9.19.2). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access or higher, to execute code on the server.
