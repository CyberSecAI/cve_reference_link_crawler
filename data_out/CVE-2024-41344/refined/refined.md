The provided content details a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in an e-commerce application built with CodeIgniter and Bootstrap.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection mechanisms, which allows the attacker to make state-changing requests without user consent.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the product name parameter. This allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts that will execute when a user, such as the administrator, views the product list.
    
**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can force an authenticated user (including an administrator) to execute unwanted actions, such as changing their password.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise:** CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized changes to user data.
*   **Security Breaches:**  If an administrative account is targeted, CSRF can lead to full compromise of the web application.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Fraudulent transactions or other unauthorized actions can cause financial losses.
*   **Loss of Trust:**  Users may lose trust in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker could trick the user into visiting a malicious link.
*   **Stored XSS:** The primary attack vector described uses a combination of stored XSS to inject a script into a product name, then leverage that XSS to trigger a CSRF attack when a logged-in administrator views the products page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject data (using the XSS vulnerability) in the "product name" field in the application.
*   The attacker needs to host a malicious javascript file on a server accessible to the targeted application.
*   The targeted administrator must be logged into the application and then access the products page, triggering the malicious script.

The provided write-up includes a detailed proof-of-concept demonstrating how the stored XSS can be used to inject a script that modifies the administrator's password using CSRF.
