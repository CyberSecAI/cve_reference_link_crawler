Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2021-45036 vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided text from `www.incibe.es` explicitly mentions CVE-2021-45036 as a vulnerability in Velneo vClient. This confirms the relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **authentication bypass**. Specifically, Velneo vClient version 28.1.3 allows an attacker to spoof a victim's user ID against the server. This is possible if the attacker has knowledge of the victim's username and hashed password.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The core vulnerability lies in how Velneo vClient authenticates users. It is not properly verifying the identity of the client, making it possible for an attacker to impersonate another user.
*   **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing:**  The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-290 which is "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing".  The hashed password is not sufficient to establish a secure session with the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access/Impersonation:** An attacker with a user's username and hashed password can completely impersonate that user's session on the server. The attacker gains all privileges of the legitimate user, leading to potentially severe damage to business applications.
*   **Compromise of Confidentiality and Integrity:** With an active session, an attacker could access sensitive data, manipulate application logic and functionality, create and remove records as the legitimate user.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:**  The attack is network-based which would indicate a remote exploitation capability with AV:N

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Username and Hashed Password:**  The attacker needs to obtain a target user's username and the corresponding hashed password. This information could be obtained from a previous data breach/compromise or other attack methods.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the Velneo server.
*   **Low Complexity/ High Impact**: The attack complexity is noted as high which suggests specific steps are necessary for a successful attack, but once that is done it has a high impact rating..

**Additional Information**

*   The provided documents indicate that the vulnerability was fixed in Velneo version 32, which was released on 11/08/2022.
*   The advisory from INCIBE gives a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.7 with a vector string AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N. This indicates a high-severity vulnerability with high impact for confidentiality and integrity.
*   Velneo is using an in-house protocol over TCP/IP named VATPS, and that was changed in the affected version to prevent this attack.
*   The documentation further explains a new authentication mechanism in version 32, where password hashes are no longer sent and replaced by a more secure authentication mechanism.
