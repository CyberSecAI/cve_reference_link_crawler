Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-36621:

**Vulnerability:** Disable Child App Restriction without Parent's Notice.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of a child to bypass the parental control app's restrictions by manipulating the Android operating system's settings, specifically by:
  - Booting into Android Safe Mode, which disables third-party apps.
  - Revoking the app's necessary permissions (Device Admin, Display over other apps, Usage Access, Accessibility).
  - The lack of proper safeguards in the application to prevent unauthorized permission revocation via Safe Mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Bypassable restrictions**: The parental control app's restrictions are not robust against basic OS-level manipulations by the child.
  - **Lack of Safe Mode protection**: The app does not properly handle the implications of Android Safe Mode, which allows disabling the app's permissions.
  - **No parental notification**: The app does not notify the parent when the restrictions are bypassed or the app is disabled by the child.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Complete bypass of parental controls**: The child can freely use their device without the restrictions set by the parent, accessing previously blocked apps and features.
  - **Circumvention of monitoring**: The child's activities are no longer monitored, allowing them to engage in potentially harmful or inappropriate online behavior without parental oversight.
  - **Uninstallation without notice**: The child can uninstall the app without the parent's knowledge, completely removing the parental control.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Physical access to the child's device**: The attacker (child) needs physical access to the device to initiate a reboot to safe mode and manipulate settings.
  - **Manipulation of Android OS**: The attack relies on the ability to reboot into Android safe mode and modify application permissions through the settings menu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Child user of the device**: The attacker needs to be the user of the device where the parental control app is installed.
  - **Basic knowledge of Android**: The attacker needs some basic knowledge of Android's safe mode and app permission settings, although the process is fairly straightforward.
  - **Physical access to the device**: The attacker needs to physically access the child's device to perform the steps.

**Additional Information:**
  - The "Safe Mode Bypass" cannot be exploited on Samsung KNOX-capable devices, as these devices can have restrictions set to disable booting into Safe Mode.
  - The content provides a detailed description of the steps a child user needs to take to bypass restrictions without the parents noticing.
  - The advisory mentions that the vendor has not fixed this issue.
