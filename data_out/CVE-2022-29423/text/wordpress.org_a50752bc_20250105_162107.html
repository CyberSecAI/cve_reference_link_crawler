The Plugin has false advertising, it can only add Countdowns – not any clocks.

Some time ago I tried out various countdown builders and this one is the best. It allows all the desired settings and offers a wide range of customization options. If you have any problems you get excellent support in the forum. I would like to thank you for this great countdown builder, which I have been using monthly for over a year now. If you have a store, the Pro version offers even more extensive functions.
