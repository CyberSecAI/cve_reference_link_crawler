An absolute path traversal vulnerability exists in parisneo/lollms-webui v9.6, specifically in the `open_file` endpoint of `lollms_advanced.py`. The `sanitize_path` function with `allow_absolute_path=True` allows an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories on a Windows system. This vulnerability can be exploited to read any file and list arbitrary directories on the affected system.
