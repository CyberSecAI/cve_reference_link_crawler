Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the CIGESv2 system. Specifically, the vulnerability resides in the way the application handles user-supplied input in the `idCentro` parameter of the `/modules/ajaxServiciosCentro.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection exploit can lead to:
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve all the information stored in the database, which could include sensitive data, personal information, and other confidential details.
    - **Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection can potentially allow attackers to modify or delete data.
    - **Complete system compromise** Though not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection can result in complete system compromise in some cases.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted SQL query through the `idCentro` parameter in a request to the `/modules/ajaxServiciosCentro.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication, meaning anyone with network access can potentially exploit it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects CIGESv2 versions prior to 2.15.5.
- The vulnerability has a critical severity rating (9.8 CVSS score)
- The issue was discovered by Ángel Heredia and Asier Barranco from Telefónica Tech.
- A patch has been provided by ATISolutions in version 2.15.5.
