Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1476

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the "Under Construction / Maintenance Mode from Acurax" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to adequately restrict access to content when maintenance mode is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes the contents of posts and pages through the REST API, even when maintenance mode is active. This bypasses the intended protection mechanism of the plugin.
- **Improper Access Control:** The plugin's access control mechanisms are insufficient, allowing unauthenticated users to retrieve content that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information contained within posts and pages, potentially including private data or confidential details. This can lead to a loss of confidentiality and could be exploited further for malicious purposes.
- **Bypassed Protection:** The core function of the plugin, which is to hide the website content during maintenance, is bypassed, rendering it ineffective.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's REST API endpoints.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable website.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any account or administrative privileges on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed by WordPress.org due to the security issue.
- There is no known patch available. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin and find a replacement.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.6.
