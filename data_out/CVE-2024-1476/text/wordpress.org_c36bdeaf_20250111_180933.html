I bought for the plugin – but seller is not responding anymore so I can’t use it anymore…

I would not suggest using this plugin. It only has basic features and just promotes its premium version like a lot of plugins do these days. It lacks great features that are found in other Under Construction plugins so I would suggest looking for another.

Com o WordPress meus projetos são executados de forma rápida e profissional. A possibilidade de alterar os arquivos e personalizar da minha forma é espetacularmente essencial no meu negócio e permite colocar qualquer site da forma que o cliente deseja.

There is zero customer support and the templates are barely customizable. After the yearly subscription is over, they will harass you with billing invoices regardless if you cancel on their portal twice, or via email five times over. All with no response or follow up. And when they yank back their stupid template, you’re stuck with a mis-configured and destroyed site that can no longer be found via your URL. Acurax?? More like Anthrax.
