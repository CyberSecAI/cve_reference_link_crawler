In version 1.2.7 of lunary-ai/lunary, any authenticated user, regardless of their role, can change the name of an organization due to improper access control. The function checkAccess() is not implemented, allowing users with the lowest privileges, such as the 'Prompt Editor' role, to modify organization attributes without proper authorization.
