Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from how Strapi handles content-type extensions. When a content-type is extended using the `strapi.container.get('content-types').extend()` method, the original content-type object is not deeply cloned. This leads to the removal of the getter for `privateAttributes` when a copy of the content-type object is made, and attributes are added to it. This getter was used during sanitization to determine which attributes should be considered private.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Deep Clone:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a deep clone when extending content types.
- **Loss of `privateAttributes` Getter:** Copying the content-type object removes the `privateAttributes` getter, which is crucial for sanitization logic.
- **Incorrect Sanitization:** Because the `privateAttributes` getter is missing, the sanitization logic considers all attributes to be public.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Private attributes, intended to be hidden, are exposed. This may include password hashes or other sensitive data.
- **Potential System Takeover:** Exposure of sensitive information, such as password hashes, could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the system.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By exposing private attributes as public, attackers can access information they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Content-Type Extension:** The vulnerability is triggered when a content-type is extended using `strapi.container.get('content-types').extend()`, and the content type object is copied.
- **Runtime Modification:** Content types can be extended at runtime, for example, in bootstrap functions or via plugins, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited in various ways.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Extend Content Types:** An attacker needs to be able to extend content types within the Strapi application by using the `strapi.container.get('content-types').extend()` method. This can be done via a plugin, or by modifying the application directly.
- **Knowledge of Strapi Internals:** The attacker needs to be aware of how Strapi handles content types and how the `privateAttributes` getter works, or be able to exploit it without deep knowledge, based on publicly available information.
- **High Privileges Required**: According to CVSS base metrics, high privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was patched in version 4.10.8 by removing the getter for private attributes.
- The vulnerability affects Strapi versions <= 4.10.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity with a CVSS score of 4.8.
- The fix involved changes to `packages/core/strapi/lib/core/domain/content-type/index.js` and `packages/core/utils/lib/content-types.js` in addition to several tests being modified.

In summary, the vulnerability is a result of incorrect handling of content-type extensions where the lack of deep cloning leads to the removal of the `privateAttributes` getter, which in turn causes the sanitization to fail, leading to exposure of private attributes.
