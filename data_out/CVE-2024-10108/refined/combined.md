### Description

The WPAdverts – Classifieds Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's adverts\_add shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Well, all i wanted to do was to ensure that my users can indicate if their intended listing is a “Used Item” or “Brand New Item”. I feel this is a very vital feature that should be in every classified plugin. It wasn’t included in this plugin and i could not find a way to insert it myself. I just had to uninstall the plugin and look for another one.

The plugin has lots of customization possibilities and we were able to implement most of our project specifications.
We worked with the plugin author on some custom functionalities and it was a smooth ride : quality work, speed and communication.
I highly recommend this plugin for its quality, customization potential and support.

You can easily implement the WPAdverts plugin with any theme and customize it for your tasks. Definitely worth the money.
