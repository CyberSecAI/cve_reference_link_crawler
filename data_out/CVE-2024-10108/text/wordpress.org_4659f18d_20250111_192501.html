Well, all i wanted to do was to ensure that my users can indicate if their intended listing is a “Used Item” or “Brand New Item”. I feel this is a very vital feature that should be in every classified plugin. It wasn’t included in this plugin and i could not find a way to insert it myself. I just had to uninstall the plugin and look for another one.

The plugin has lots of customization possibilities and we were able to implement most of our project specifications.
We worked with the plugin author on some custom functionalities and it was a smooth ride : quality work, speed and communication.
I highly recommend this plugin for its quality, customization potential and support.
