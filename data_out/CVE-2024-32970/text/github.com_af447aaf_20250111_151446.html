# Cross-site Scripting (XSS) possible with maliciously formed HTML attribute names and values in Phlex

High

[joeldrapper](/joeldrapper)
published
GHSA-9p57-h987-4vgx
Apr 29, 2024

## Package

bundler

phlex
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 1.10.2

## Patched versions

1.10.2, 1.9.3

## Description

There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data.

Since the last two vulnerabilities [GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g "GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g") and [GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c "GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c"), we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues.

We now exercise every possible attack vector we can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 [known XSS payloads](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list).

The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browser are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes.

### Impact

If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user.

```
a(href: user_profile) { "Profile" }
```

If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

```
h1(**JSON.parse(user_attributes))
```
### Patches

Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex) for all minor versions released in the last year.

* [1.10.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.10.2)
* [1.9.3](https://rubygems.org/gems/phlex/versions/1.9.3)

If you are on `main`, it has been patched since [`da8f943`](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/commit/da8f94342a84cff9d78c98bcc3b3604ee2e577d2)

### Workarounds

Configuring a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) that does not allow [`unsafe-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#unsafe-inline) would effectively prevent this vulnerability from being exploited.

### References

In addition to upgrading to a patched version of Phlex, we strongly recommend configuring a Content Security Policy header that does not allow `unsafe-inline`. Here’s how you can configure a Content Security Policy header in Rails. <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#content-security-policy-header>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
