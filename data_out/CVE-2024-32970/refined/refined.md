{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way Phlex handles HTML attribute names and values, specifically how it escapes user-provided data when rendering HTML tags, making it possible to inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted attributes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Insufficient output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, by providing malicious HTML attributes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting malicious javascript code in an href attribute of an <a> tag",
      "By injecting malicious event attributes, such as onclick, in any HTML tag via splatting user-provided attributes"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft malicious HTML attributes and inject them into the application, which are then rendered unsafely and cause code execution in the user's browser.",
    "patches": [
      "Versions 1.10.2 and 1.9.3 contain fixes for this vulnerability. The fix has also been applied in main branch with commit da8f943."
    ],
    "workarounds": "Configuring a Content Security Policy (CSP) that does not allow 'unsafe-inline' would prevent the vulnerability from being exploited."
