Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-23942:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded key and Initialization Vector (IV) within the Apache Doris (incubating) project. This was a copy-paste from the Apache Kylin project. Specifically, the `EncryptUtil` class uses a hardcoded byte array for the encryption key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key:** The primary weakness is the use of a static, hardcoded key within the `EncryptUtil` class. This eliminates the security benefit of encryption.
*   **Hardcoded IV:** Although not as directly stated as hardcoded IV, the code uses a value read from KylinConfig and it may lead to hardcoded IV as well. This contributes to the predictability of the encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The use of a hardcoded key and potentially IV means an attacker can decrypt the information that has been encrypted with this key. In this specific case, it affects LDAP passwords used by Doris. An attacker gaining access to encrypted LDAP passwords can decrypt them and potentially use them to gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Encrypted Data:** An attacker needs access to the encrypted data (LDAP passwords in this case) stored or transmitted by the Doris system. This could involve gaining access to databases, network traffic, log files, or other places where the encrypted passwords might be stored.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** The hardcoded key and IV are present in the source code. If an attacker has access to the source code or the application, they can easily extract the hardcoded key and IV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Encrypted Data:** The attacker needs to be able to access the encrypted data.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the system uses hardcoded keys (or has obtained the key in some way).
*   **Ability to Decrypt:** The attacker needs to be able to perform decryption using the identified hardcoded key and IV.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Dwi Siswanto.
*   The issue is resolved in Apache Doris version 1.0.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `EncryptUtil.java` file in the Apache Kylin project as well and needs a similar fix.

In summary, this CVE highlights a significant security flaw resulting from hardcoding cryptographic keys, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as LDAP passwords. The fix involves removing hardcoded keys and properly generating keys and IV.
