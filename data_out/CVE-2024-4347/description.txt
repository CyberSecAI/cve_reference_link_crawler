The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.6 via the specificDeleteCache function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can include wp-config.php files of the affected site or other sites in a shared hosting environment.
