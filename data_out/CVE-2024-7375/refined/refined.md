Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection.
- The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `quiz` parameter of the `/my_quiz_result.php` URI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query, which the database will execute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Escalation of privileges:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially escalate their privileges.
- **Data breach/disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive information from the database.
- **Data manipulation/deletion:** Attackers may be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Denial of service:** Attackers may be able to disrupt the application or database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/my_quiz_result.php`, including malicious SQL code in the `quiz` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are explicitly mentioned to be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command can be used to automate the process of detecting and exploiting the vulnerability.
- The provided HTTP request example demonstrates how the malicious SQL code is injected through the vulnerable `quiz` parameter.
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.0 of the "Simple Realtime Quiz System".
