Dell NetWorker, Version 19.7 has an improper authorization vulnerability in the NetWorker client. An unauthenticated attacker within the same network could potentially exploit this by manipulating a command leading to gain of complete access to the server file further resulting in information leaks, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
