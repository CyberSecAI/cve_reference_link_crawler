- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource (CWE-732) and a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Incorrect permission assignment for critical resource allows unauthorized access to a named pipe.
    - TOCTOU race condition allows for manipulation of data during a check and usage window
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers on the same file sharing network can execute commands by writing data into a Windows pipe, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based: Attacker must be on the same file-sharing network.
    - Exploitation involves writing malicious data to the named pipe.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker must be on the same file-sharing network as the vulnerable FortiClientWindows instance.
   - The attacker needs to be able to write data to the vulnerable named pipe.
