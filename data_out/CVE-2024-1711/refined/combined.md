### Description

The Create by Mediavine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## FAQ

### How do I import my existing recipes?

[Download and install the Mediavine Recipe Importers utility](https://www.mediavine.com/mediavine-recipe-importers-download)

### Which recipe card plugins does the importer support?

* Cookbook
* EasyRecipe
* Meal Planner Pro Recipes
* Purr Recipe Cards
* Simple Recipe Pro
* WP Recipe Maker
* WP Tasty
* WP Ultimate Recipe
* Yummly
* Zip Recipes
* ZipList Recipe Plugin

### How will the cards display?

Our cards are displayed using a WordPress shortcode.

This means that if the plugin is disabled, the recipes themselves will not display on the front end of a blog post. This is typical behavior for most WordPress plugins.

If the plugin is deactivated, no data will be deleted and reactivating the plugin will restore the original card display.

### Will I be able to add nutritional data?

Yes! Nutritional data is an important part of Schema, which search engines love to have for optimal results.

Nutrition facts can be manually entered for a recipe. They will also transfer over if the recipe already contains it.

We also provide automatic nutrition calculation through our partnership with [Nutritionix](http://nutritionix.com/). [Learn more about this feature](http://help.mediavine.com/create-by-mediavine/auto-calculate-nutrition-with-create-by-mediavine).

### How much does it cost?

Create is free to the blogging community at large. You do not need to be a Mediavine publisher to use it. All core functions of the plugin will always remain free.

There may be features in the future that would need a license for a fee, but the core functionalities will always remain free and supported for everyone — including plugin updates to keep Create in compliance with WordPress releases.

### Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin?

Please report security bugs found in the source code of the Create by Mediavine plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/mediavine-create). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment, and notify the developers of this plugin.

I’d love to rate Create with 5-stars, but unfortunately I can’t. I thought it was an excellent plugin to begin with. I changed all my recipes over to it, which was a bit stupid. The cards are quite good, but if you want some changes, you need to know a little coding. Star ratings are paramount because Google wants them; however, Creates star-rating really sucks. It offers a comment area and write a review area; there are no alternatives; they confuse readers, so you get less comments and ratings..not good. It’s great it offers so much for free, but like any free plugin it has its limitations. I switched back to WP Recipe Maker it’s much better.

For recipe blogs that rely on a plugin for cards, this is a critical component of their sites content. Wordpress announces changes and allows for proper development updates prior to releasing a new version. When a critical plugin is not updated with a major release to the extent that it breaks your site….time to find a reliable alternative.

I’d love to rate this plugin much higher, but the, in my view, embarrassing neglect of an export function really hurts the plugin. This is a huge oversight on the part of the developer, one that has been brought to their attention in the support here, but nothing has been done. Export should really be a no brainer feature for any content plugin/software.

We started our food blog and searched and went through all the plugins there was available, and when we came across this it was the game-changer our site (tastyrecipelovers) needed. It has everything you need, that other recipe plugins put in their premium section, and its free. The Recipe card has great looking cards to choose from and your users won’t be disappointed.

I’ve used three recipe plugins including create. All I can say is that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Create! As soon as I started using it reviews came rolling in and they’ve been snowballing ever since. I’ve also started making money as an Amazon affiliate using creates recommended products. I’ve used it for recipes, round up lists, and how-to’s. It’s easy to use both as a creator and a reader and the SEO is wonderful! Honestly, I cannot say enough good things and highly recommended it to everyone.

**Jump To Card**

We heard you! The primary addition of the 1.5 Create release is the addition of Jump To Card links within posts. In order to make this feature great, we worked to optimize placement of Mediavine ads within cards when users click the jump button. We understand the value of great reader experiences, so we made sure to mitigate potential issues with ad viewability for publishers who enable this feature. (If you’re not a Mediavine publisher, you have nothing to worry about here!)

* To enable this setting, register your plugin if you haven’t already. Then, go to “Pro” settings. Click the Jump To Card checkbox. That’s it!
* Links will automatically be added to the top of posts – no need to add them manually!
* Links can be disabled on a post-by-post basis with the “Disable Jump To Recipe” control in the Create sidebar. Note that this feature requires Gutenberg – refer to our Gutenberg help guide if you need to install Gutenberg].
* Buttons can be one of three styles – a link, or a solid or hollow button. Buttons can either use gray or – if you’ve enabled custom colors for your cards – your primary color. Both of these settings can be adjusted from the “Pro” tab.

Other Changes

Additionally, we have some other features and improvements.

* New color picker: We’ve replaced the primary and secondary color selection tools with a text field that allows hex input, as well as some nice defaults.
* Video schema improvements: Videos added to Create cards will now include video data as part of the Recipe or How-To schema instead of adding standalone Video schema, preventing duplicate schema issues. Schema is nice, but just to a limit!
