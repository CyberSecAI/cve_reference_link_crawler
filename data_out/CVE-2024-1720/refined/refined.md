Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1720

**Vulnerable Software:** User Registration â€“ Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin (versions <= 3.1.4)

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'Display Name' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the 'Display Name' user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This XSS vulnerability is stored because the injected script is saved in the database and executed when the affected page is accessed.
*   **Self-Based XSS:** The injected script will only execute when the user whose 'Display Name' was modified accesses a page where their display name is shown.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts.
*   The injected scripts execute whenever a user views a page where the vulnerable 'Display Name' is displayed. This could be used to perform malicious actions on behalf of the user who is logged in and has the injected display name.
*   Impact is limited, because the attacker requires the specific user to login as the account that has been modified.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject the malicious script by modifying the display name.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use social engineering to trick a user into logging in as the account where the XSS payload is injected to execute the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in, but does need to have the ability to modify the 'Display Name' of a user.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user with the injected display name into logging in to execute the script.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.5 of the plugin by applying `esc_attr` and `esc_html` to the output of the display name.
*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.7.
*   The Wordfence article highlights that this is a "self-based" XSS, since the XSS will only trigger when the logged in user whose display name was modified accesses the page that renders the display name.
