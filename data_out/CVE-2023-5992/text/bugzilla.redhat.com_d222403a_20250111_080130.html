| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2023-11-08 11:05:46 UTC  ``` The OpenSC code handling the PKCS#1 encryption padding removal is not implemented in side-channel resistant way, which can lead to possible leak to private key data.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-26 02:14:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:0966 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0966](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0966)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-02-26 02:17:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:0967 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0967](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A0967)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c10)  Veronika Hanulíková    2024-03-07 09:17:59 UTC  ``` Should there be for this CVE also clone for Fedora?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c11)  Zack Miele    2024-03-14 14:22:05 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c10): > Should there be for this CVE also clone for Fedora?  At the time this bz was made public the Fedora package had already been updated to a fixed version. I did not want to create any unneeded noise.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2248685#c12)  Jakub Jelen    2024-03-14 16:34:03 UTC  ``` No, it was not. The fix landed only in 0.25.0 as described here:  <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/CVE-2023-5992>  The NIST pages were not updated with the latest information   <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5992> <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5992>  Can you take care of updating these?   ``` |  |
