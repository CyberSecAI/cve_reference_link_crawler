  "cveId": "CVE-2023-5992",
  "description": "The OpenSC code handling the PKCS#1.5 encryption padding removal is not implemented in side-channel resistant way, which can lead to decryption of previously captured RSA ciphertexts and forging of signatures based on the timing data.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the non-constant time implementation of PKCS#1.5 padding removal in OpenSC.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability due to timing variations in code execution.",
      "Use of non-constant time algorithms for cryptographic operations.",
      "Vulnerable implementation of PKCS#1.5 padding removal."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to decryption of previously captured RSA ciphertexts and forging of signatures. An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to network resources.",
      "attackVectors": [
      "Network-based man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack to intercept and modify Kerberos messages.",
        "Microarchitectural side-channel attacks (e.g., Flush+Reload) on the client's CPU to observe timing variations in the de-padding process.",
         "Malicious website to trigger authentication attempts."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server, and execute unprivileged code on the client machine or, trick a user to access a malicious website.",
    "requiredAttackerPosition": "Man-in-the-middle position in the network, or able to run code on the target user's machine, or a malicious website"
  },
  "affectedComponents": [
    "OpenSC library (versions prior to 0.25.0)",
    "Windows basecsp smartcard interface",
    "Kerberos implementations on Windows and several Linux distributions (specifically the Heimdal implementation)."

  ],
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is exploitable by observing timing differences during the PKCS#1.5 de-padding process. This allows an attacker to craft chosen ciphertexts that can leak information about the decrypted plaintext, enabling the recovery of the session token and potentially other sensitive data. The vulnerability can be triggered with network traffic analysis, microarchitectural side-channel attacks and via malicious websites that can trigger authentication requests. The attack can be accelerated by triggering multiple Kerberos session attempts without user interaction.",
  "remediation": "Upgrade to OpenSC version 0.25.0 or later, which includes constant-time implementations of the affected functions. Apply relevant security patches provided by OS vendors."
