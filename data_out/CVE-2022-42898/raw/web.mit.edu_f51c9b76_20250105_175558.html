      <A NAME="announcement">
	Kerberos 5 Release 1.19.4 is now available
      </A>
    </H2>

    <P>The MIT Kerberos Team announces the availability of the
      krb5-1.19.4 release.  The <A HREF="krb5-1.19.4.sig">detached PGP
      signature</A> is available without going through the download
      page, if you wish to verify the authenticity of a distribution
      you have obtained elsewhere.

    <P>Please see the <A HREF="README-1.19.4.txt">README file</A> for a
      more complete list of changes.

    <P>You may also see the current full
      <A HREF="https://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.19/fixed-1.19.4.html">list
	of fixed bugs</A> tracked in our RT bugtracking system.

    <H2>Triple-DES transition</H2>

    <P>Beginning with the krb5-1.19 release, a warning will be issued
      if initial credentials are acquired using the des3-cbc-sha1
      encryption type.  In future releases, this encryption type will
      be disabled by default and eventually removed.

    <P>Beginning with the krb5-1.18 release, single-DES encryption
      types have been removed.

    <H2>Major changes in 1.19 (2021-02-01)</H2>
    <DL>
      <DT>Administrator experience
      <DD>
	<UL>
	  <LI>When a client keytab is present, the GSSAPI krb5 mech
            will refresh credentials even if the current credentials
            were acquired manually.

	  <LI>It is now harder to accidentally delete the K/M entry from a KDB.
	</UL>
      </DD>
      <DT>Developer experience
      <DD>
	<UL>
	  <LI>gss_acquire_cred_from() now supports the "password" and
            "verify" options, allowing credentials to be acquired via
            password and verified using a keytab key.

          <LI>When an application accepts a GSS security context, the
            new GSS_C_CHANNEL_BOUND_FLAG will be set if the initiator
            and acceptor both provided matching channel bindings.

	  <LI>Added the GSS_KRB5_NT_X509_CERT name type, allowing
	    S4U2Self requests to identify the desired client principal
	    by certificate.

	  <LI>PKINIT certauth modules can now cause the hw-authent
	    flag to be set in issued tickets.

	  <LI>The krb5_init_creds_step() API will now issue the same
	    password expiration warnings as
	    krb5_get_init_creds_password().
	</UL>
      </DD>
      <DT>Protocol evolution
      <DD>
	<UL>
	  <LI>Added client and KDC support for Microsoft's
	    Resource-Based Constrained Delegation, which allows
	    cross-realm S4U2Proxy requests.  A third-party database
	    module is required for KDC support.

	  <LI>kadmin/admin is now the preferred server principal name
	    for kadmin connections, and the host-based form is no
	    longer created by default.  The client will still try the
	    host-based form as a fallback.

	  <LI>Added client and server support for Microsoft's
	    KERB_AP_OPTIONS_CBT extension, which causes channel
	    bindings to be required for the initiator if the acceptor
	    provided them.  The client will send this option if the
	    client_aware_gss_bindings profile option is set.
	</UL>
      </DD>
      <DT>User experience
      <DD>
	<UL>
	  <LI>kinit will now issue a warning if the des3-cbc-sha1
	    encryption type is used in the reply.  This encryption
	    type will be deprecated and removed in future releases.

	  <LI>Added kvno flags --out-cache, --no-store, and
	    --cached-only (inspired by Heimdal's kgetcred).
