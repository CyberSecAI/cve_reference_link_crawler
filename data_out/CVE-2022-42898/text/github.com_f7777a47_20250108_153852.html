### @jaltman **[jaltman](/jaltman)** commented [Nov 16, 2022](#issue-1451786369)

On systems where 'unsigned long' is 32-bits and the 'size' parameter is set to 8 and the bytes are:

0x78 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00

When 'i' becomes 4 'v' will be 0 again. As 'unsigned long' is only able to hold 4 bytes.

Change the type of 'v' from 'unsigned long' to 'uint64\_t' which matches the type of the output parameter 'value'.
