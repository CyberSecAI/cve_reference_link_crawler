## Kerberos 5 Release 1.19.4 is now available

The MIT Kerberos Team announces the availability of the
krb5-1.19.4 release. The [detached PGP
signature](krb5-1.19.4.sig) is available without going through the download
page, if you wish to verify the authenticity of a distribution
you have obtained elsewhere.

Please see the [README file](README-1.19.4.txt) for a
more complete list of changes.

You may also see the current full
[list
of fixed bugs](https://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/NoAuth/krb5-1.19/fixed-1.19.4.html) tracked in our RT bugtracking system.
## Triple-DES transition

Beginning with the krb5-1.19 release, a warning will be issued
if initial credentials are acquired using the des3-cbc-sha1
encryption type. In future releases, this encryption type will
be disabled by default and eventually removed.

Beginning with the krb5-1.18 release, single-DES encryption
types have been removed.
## Major changes in 1.19.4 (2022-11-15)

* Fix integer overflows in PAC parsing [CVE-2022-42898].* Fix memory leak in OTP kdcpreauth module.

## Major changes in 1.19.3 (2022-03-11)

* Fix a denial of service attack against the KDC [CVE-2021-37750].

## Major changes in 1.19.2 (2021-07-22)

* Fix a denial of service attack against the KDC encrypted
  challenge code [CVE-2021-36222].* Fix a memory leak when gss\_inquire\_cred() is called without
    a credential handle.

## Major changes in 1.19.1 (2021-02-18)

* Fix a linking issue with Samba.* Better support multiple pkinit\_identities values by checking
    whether certificates can be loaded for each value.

## Major changes in 1.19 (2021-02-01)

Administrator experience

* When a client keytab is present, the GSSAPI krb5 mech
  will refresh credentials even if the current credentials
  were acquired manually.* It is now harder to accidentally delete the K/M entry from a KDB.

Developer experience

* gss\_acquire\_cred\_from() now supports the "password" and
  "verify" options, allowing credentials to be acquired via
  password and verified using a keytab key.* When an application accepts a GSS security context, the
    new GSS\_C\_CHANNEL\_BOUND\_FLAG will be set if the initiator
    and acceptor both provided matching channel bindings.* Added the GSS\_KRB5\_NT\_X509\_CERT name type, allowing
      S4U2Self requests to identify the desired client principal
      by certificate.* PKINIT certauth modules can now cause the hw-authent
        flag to be set in issued tickets.* The krb5\_init\_creds\_step() API will now issue the same
          password expiration warnings as
          krb5\_get\_init\_creds\_password().

Protocol evolution

* Added client and KDC support for Microsoft's
  Resource-Based Constrained Delegation, which allows
  cross-realm S4U2Proxy requests. A third-party database
  module is required for KDC support.* kadmin/admin is now the preferred server principal name
    for kadmin connections, and the host-based form is no
    longer created by default. The client will still try the
    host-based form as a fallback.* Added client and server support for Microsoft's
      KERB\_AP\_OPTIONS\_CBT extension, which causes channel
      bindings to be required for the initiator if the acceptor
      provided them. The client will send this option if the
      client\_aware\_gss\_bindings profile option is set.

User experience

* kinit will now issue a warning if the des3-cbc-sha1
  encryption type is used in the reply. This encryption
  type will be deprecated and removed in future releases.* Added kvno flags --out-cache, --no-store, and
    --cached-only (inspired by Heimdal's kgetcred).
