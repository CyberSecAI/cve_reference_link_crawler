[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2024-041/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2024-041: Endress%2BHauser%3A%20Multiple%20products%20are%20vulnerable%20to%20code%20injection)

#### ID

VDE-2024-041

#### Published

2024-09-10 10:00 (CEST)

#### Last update

#### Vendor(s)

Endress+Hauser AG

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Echo Curve Viewer | <= 5.2.2.6 |
|  | FieldCare SFE500 Package USB | <= V1.40.00.7448 |
|  | FieldCare SFE500 Package Web-Package | <= V1.40.00.7448 |
|  | Field Xpert SMT50 | <= SMT50\_Win10\_LTSC\_21H2\_v1.07.00\_RC02\_03 |
|  | Field Xpert SMT70 | <= SMT70\_Win10\_LTSC\_21H2\_v1.07.00\_RC02\_01 |

|  | Field Xpert SMT79 | <= V1.08.02-1.8.8684.34292 |

#### Summary

Echo Curve Viewer is an utility used for offline visualization of previously recorded envelope curve data. Envelope curve records are exported from other Endress+Hauser software products like FieldCare as .curves files.

Echo Curve Viewer opens .curves files and displays their contents. The .curves files contain device- specific C# calculation scripts as .cs files, that are needed for the interpretation of certain curve record types.

Echo Curve Viewer loads .curves files and executes the contained C# code.

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2024-6596](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2024-6596)

#### Last Update:

Dec. 2, 2024, 11:19 a.m.

#### Severity

9.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') [(CWE-94)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)

#### Summary

An unauthenticated remote attacker can run malicious c# code included in curve files and execute commands in the users context.

#### Details

[cert.vde.com](https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/weakness/CVE-2024-6596)

---

#### Impact

.curves files are not authenticated and universally trusted by the Echo Curve Viewer. Therefore, the contained C# code is executed without further authentication or validation.

Potential attack vector: manipulated .cs files with malicious C# code may be included in .curves file.

#### Solution

**Remediation**

* For standalone Echo Curve Viewer installations, download and install Echo Curve Viewer version >=
  6.00.00 from the [Endress+Hauser Software Portal](https://software-products.endress.com/ui/private/softwaredownload)
* For bundled installations with FieldCare SFE500, download and install FieldCare SFE500 Package version
  >= 1.40.1 from the [Endress+Hauser Software Portal](https://software-products.endress.com/ui/private/softwaredownload)
* For Field Xpert Devices, the required update is installed automatically during startup. This requires a
  working internet connection and (under certain circumstances) a valid maintenance period and/or a
  connection to the E+H Netilion Cloud. Please refer to the Field Xpert documentation for details regarding
  the update mechanism.

#### Reported by

CERT@VDE coordinated with Endress+Hauser.
