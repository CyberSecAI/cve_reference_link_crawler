The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes details for CVE-2024-23947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper array index validation within the `readMSH` functionality of the libigl library when parsing `.msh` files. Specifically, the code reads node or element indices from the file and uses them to write to vectors, but it does not check if the read index is within the bounds of the vector.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The code uses an index read from the input file to write data into a vector without prior validation of the index. This can occur in multiple functions within `MshLoader.cpp` when handling node data and element data in both binary and ASCII formatted `.msh` files.

Specifically for CVE-2024-23947, the vulnerability is located in `igl::MshLoader::parse_nodes` when handling binary `.msh` files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to an out-of-bounds write, which can potentially cause a crash, denial-of-service, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted `.msh` file that contains out-of-bounds node indices. This malicious file needs to be opened by an application using the vulnerable `libigl` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious `.msh` file to a user or application that uses the vulnerable `libigl` library. The user interaction of opening/processing the malicious file is required.
