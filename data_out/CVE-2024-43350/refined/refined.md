- **Interact with the database:** The attacker could potentially interact with the database in unauthorized ways.
- **General impact:** The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable location, but it may lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would exploit the IDOR vulnerability by manipulating direct object references, potentially in URL parameters, form fields, or API calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:**  The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.
