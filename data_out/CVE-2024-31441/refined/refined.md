  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Lack of restrictions on connection parameters for the ClickHouse data source.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of access controls"
     ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file reading on the server where DataEase is running.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting malicious parameters in the connection string of a ClickHouse data source, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to configure or modify the ClickHouse data source connection parameters within DataEase. Specifically, they need to be able to upload a malicious ClickHouse driver and set the `compress=0&localFile=true` connection parameters."

     "affected_versions": "1.18.18",
     "patched_versions": "1.18.19",
     "workarounds": "Upgrade to version 1.18.19.",
     "steps_to_reproduce": "1. Upload a specific version of the ClickHouse driver, 2. Configure a data source with `compress=0&localFile=true`, 3. Create a table to store read file data, 4. Execute an SQL query using `INFILE` to read the desired file.",
     "attacker_setup": "The attacker sets up a ClickHouse database using `docker run -d -p 18124:8123 -p19001:9000 clickhouse/clickhouse-server`."
