- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow during the calculation of the buffer size needed to store the Mini FAT sectors of an OLE file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to heap buffer overflow. Specifically, the multiplication of the "Number of Mini FAT sectors" and "sector size" is done using 32-bit integers, which can overflow if the result exceeds the maximum value, leading to allocating an undersized buffer. Later, when data is copied into this undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted OLE file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide the malicious file to be scanned by the vulnerable software.
