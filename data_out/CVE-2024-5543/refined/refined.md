Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5543

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter within the Slideshow Gallery LITE plugin's shortcode functionality. The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied input within the shortcode's SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is time-based SQL Injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `id` parameter within the shortcode. The lack of proper sanitization and preparation of the SQL query allows for this injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability may allow attackers to cause database errors or slowdowns impacting the performance of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the `id` parameter within the shortcode functionality of the plugin. This is available wherever the shortcode is used in the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level privileges.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to inject the malicious SQL through the shortcode.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `slideshow-gallery.php` file of the plugin.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code is within the `embed` function of the `SlideshowGallery` class, before the sanitization added in version 1.8.2
- The parameter `id` was not sanitized allowing injection of SQL code into the database query.
- The plugin uses shortcodes, so this vulnerability is exploitable on any page/post where a shortcode for the Slideshow Gallery LITE plugin is placed

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c from CERT PL.
- The vulnerability is patched in version 1.8.2 of the Slideshow Gallery LITE plugin. The patch sanitizes the shortcode attributes before using them in the SQL queries.
- The provided diffs in the `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content show the code changes made in version 1.8.2 to fix the vulnerability, specifically the addition of input sanitization using `sanitize_text_field` and `intval`.
