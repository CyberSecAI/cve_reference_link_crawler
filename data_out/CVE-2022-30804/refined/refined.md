Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `delete_image.php` script in Elitecms v1.01 has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary file deletion.
*   The script takes a `file` parameter in the URL, and it directly uses this parameter in a file deletion operation without sufficient validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can control the `file` parameter and specify any file path on the server accessible to the webserver user, leading to the deletion of arbitrary files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not perform any checks to ensure that the provided `file` path is actually an image file or is within an allowed directory. It directly uses the given path in a file system operation.
*   **Path Traversal:** The use of `../` in the provided example indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by using relative paths to traverse outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss:** An attacker can delete critical system files or website files, leading to data loss or complete website unavailability.
*   **System Instability:** Deleting critical system files could cause the server to malfunction.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deletion of website or application files can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** By deleting specific files, an attacker may be able to disrupt the system to gain further access or exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/delete_image.php` script, where the `file` parameter contains the path to the file to be deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable website.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the file system structure of the target system to delete specific files. However, by using techniques like path traversal, they can potentially explore the file system.
*  **No Authentication:** The provided example did not require any authentication

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `/eliteCMS1.01/admin/delete_image.php` script.
*   The attacker can send a GET request like `/eliteCMS1.01/admin/delete_image.php?file=../shell.php` to delete the `shell.php` file located in the parent directory.
*   The provided example successfully demonstrates the deletion of a file outside of the intended directory by exploiting the lack of input sanitization/validation.
