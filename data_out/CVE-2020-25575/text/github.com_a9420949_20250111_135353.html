### **[Qwaz](/Qwaz)** commented [Nov 13, 2019](#issue-522487156)

| I noticed that it is possible to cause type confusion in downcast by manually implementing `__private_get_type_id__`.  <https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=ad66fe439660eb8373996bfd6bd7a835>  Although the name of the function clearly shows that it is a private API, I believe a safe Rust program should not violate the memory safety guaranteed by Rust type system. |

| Actually, the bug here looks very similar to what happened to the standard library: <https://rustsec.org/advisories/CVE-2019-12083.html> |
