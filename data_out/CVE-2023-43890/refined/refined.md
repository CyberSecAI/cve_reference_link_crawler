{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The router's diagnostic tools (ping and traceroute) do not properly sanitize user input, allowing injection of OS commands via HTTP.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the filter only blocks space, |, ;, and &, but not backticks '`' and dollar signs '$'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands as the root user on the router, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP requests to the router's diagnostic tools (ping and traceroute) with malicious payloads in the IP address field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface."
