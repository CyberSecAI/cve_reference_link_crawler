Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7291

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on user meta fields within the JetFormBuilder plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows modification of restricted user meta fields during user registration or update processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The plugin fails to adequately restrict which user meta fields can be modified, allowing modification of sensitive fields.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input when mapping form fields to user meta fields, enabling the injection of arbitrary user metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers with administrator privileges (or higher in a multisite environment) can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to a super-admin level. This could grant them full control over the WordPress website and network.
*   **Complete Site Compromise**: By gaining super-admin access, attackers can modify plugins, themes, and perform any administrative action.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote exploitation.
*   **Form Submission:** An attacker would submit a form with fields that map to sensitive user meta fields. This is possible when the administrator has enabled the "register user" action, but can also be exploited during "update user" action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or higher (e.g., a super-admin in a multisite network)
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Settings**: The attacker needs to know how the form fields are mapped to user meta in the plugin settings.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the `register-user.php` and `user-meta-property.php` files. The `register-user.php` file handles the user registration process, while `user-meta-property.php` manages user meta updates. The code fails to prevent modification of restricted user meta keys, such as `wp_capabilities`, which controls user roles and permissions. This allows an attacker to register or update user meta to change their capabilities to `super-admin`.

**Affected Software:**
*   **Plugin:** JetFormBuilder
*   **Versions:** All versions up to and including 3.3.4.1.
**Patch:** Update to version 3.3.4.2 or later.
