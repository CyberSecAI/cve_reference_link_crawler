| This could be because there are cases where the loop can accidentally skip over the trailing nul in the format string. E.g. line 771 and 778 both increment fmt, but there isn't a nul check in between.  I think this should only happen on non-well-formed format strings (e.g. the string "%0") so I don't know how the problem came up in practice. We should probably add "if (!\*fmt) break" every time fmt is about to be incremented, in cases where it could conceivably have already been incremented without being checked.  From a quick check, I think strings ending with "%0" are the only way to accidentally walk past the trailing nul. |

| I have not succeeded in reproducing the problem with this proof-of-concept. I'm on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Here's a recording: <https://asciinema.org/a/V11UdZqa4GXbbL5eLDFjZYtMn>  It's not made explicit in the recording, but I checked out commit [0a9f07a](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/commit/0a9f07a0fc21d1f989adaa8f35f74b29349307d6).  Changes I made were: 1.) I had to have `-faddress=sanitize` in LDFLAGS as well as in CCFLAGS, otherwise it can't link. 2.) I modified the proof-of-concept to remove the `JSON.parse()` call, just to clarify that the reported syntax error is from `JSON.parse()` rather than from the `poc.js` source.  I don't get any output from AddressSanitizer.  [@hope-fly](https://github.com/hope-fly) can you give more information on how to reproduce? |

### **[gfwilliams](/gfwilliams)** commented [Jan 25, 2022](#issuecomment-1021272325)

| Ok, just got it. It's actually `jswrap_json_stringify` (further up the stack) that sets the `whitespace` string up.  Looks like if you pass an object for the whitespace arg of stringify it's converted to a string, but isn't zero-terminated correctly so then later on `cbprintf` reads past the end of the string.  ``` print(JSON.stringify({a:{b:1}},null,{ thisx: 324325235325 }))  ```  The one this issue this missed which is really scary is what happens if you put in "%d" as the padding string. I'm putting in a fix now.  But I should note I couldn't reproduce either - I just saw the line using `whitespace` and checked back to where it was set. |

| Note the bug with a format string of "%0" is still there, although it's not obvious to me that it's possible to trigger it from JS, every `cbprintf` call I can find has the format string coming from C. |
