The provided content is related to CVE-2022-46289 and provides more details than the official CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an integer wrap-around when calculating the size of a buffer, `confCoords`, in the `OrcaOutputFormat::ReadMolecule` function within Open Babel when parsing an ORCA format file. Specifically, the multiplication of `nAtoms * 3` is done as a 32-bit integer, which can wrap, resulting in a smaller than expected allocation.
- Additionally, a second issue exists within the same function: after allocating the `confCoords` buffer the code enters a loop which writes into this buffer without checking if the index `i` is less than the number of atoms. This leads to a heap-based out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) due to an integer wrap-around during memory allocation.
- Heap-based out-of-bounds write due to missing size check when writing to the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution due to the heap-based out-of-bounds write.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted malformed ORCA file, specifically crafted with a large number of atoms that cause an integer overflow or with less atoms than the number of coordinate lines to trigger the out-of-bounds write.
- The vulnerable code is reached when the application `obabel` is used to convert a crafted ORCA file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious ORCA file to a system using a vulnerable version of Open Babel. This could be achieved through network accessible services that utilize Open Babel to parse and convert chemical file formats.
