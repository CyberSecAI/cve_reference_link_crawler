{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Realtek RTL8111EP-CG/RTL8111FP-CG firmware uses a hard-coded password for its DASH functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can use the hard-coded password to obtain the serial number and some service information of the host when the host is rebooted by another user. This could potentially lead to information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required. The attacker needs to be on the same machine or have physical access to the machine.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be local (physical access) and no special privileges are required."
