- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper user-input sanitization in the `execute` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Attackers can gain full control of the impacted component by executing arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data theft, system modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the vulnerable `execute` function by injecting malicious commands within user-supplied input. The attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to pass input to the `execute` function, does not require any prior authorization, and user interaction is not required.
