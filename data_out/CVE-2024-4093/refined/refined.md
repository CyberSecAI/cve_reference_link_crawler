Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the web application failing to properly validate or filter user input data. Specifically, the `view_application.php` file in the "Simple Subscription Website with Admin System" does not sanitize user-supplied data before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not implement proper input validation or sanitization mechanisms before using user-provided data in SQL queries.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application likely constructs SQL queries by concatenating user inputs directly into the query string, creating an injection point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation/Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database through crafted SQL injection payloads.
*   **Arbitrary Query Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to various malicious activities, including data exfiltration or even denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Input Fields:** The primary attack vector is via user input fields within the `view_application.php` script.
*  **Unspecified Input:** The specific vulnerable input parameters within `view_application.php` are not specified, however any data that makes it into an SQL query without sanitization is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to interact with the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker must have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.
*   **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to identify input fields or parameters used by the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `view_application.php` of the "Simple Subscription Website with Admin System 1.0".
*   The application source code is available at the provided URL: `https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15013/simple-subscription-website-admin-panel-php-and-sqlite-source-code.html`
*   The vulnerability was submitted by a VulDB user.
