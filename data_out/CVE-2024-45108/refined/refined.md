- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) leading to potential memory corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The provided information does not specify the exact attack vector, but it indicates a local attack (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), and user interaction needed (UI:R). This suggests the attack requires a malicious file or other crafted input to be opened by a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce a user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Photoshop, likely via a local file system or file sharing mechanism.
