- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of U3D files within Kofax Power PDF. This leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted U3D file or visits a malicious page containing a malicious U3D file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious U3D file to the victim, which could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting the file on a website the victim visits. The attacker also requires user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
