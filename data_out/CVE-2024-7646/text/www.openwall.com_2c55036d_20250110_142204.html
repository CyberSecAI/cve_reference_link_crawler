Subject: [kubernetes] CVE-2024-7646: Ingress-nginx Annotation Validation Bypass

Hello Kubernetes Community,

A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx where an actor with
permission to create Ingress objects (in the `networking.k8s.io` or
`extensions` API group) can bypass annotation validation to inject
arbitrary commands and obtain the credentials of the ingress-nginx
controller. In the default configuration, that credential has access to all
secrets in the cluster.

This issue has been rated High (8.8)
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
<<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>>
and assigned CVE-2024-7646.

Am I vulnerable?

This bug affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed
on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running
`kubectl get po -A` and looking for `ingress-nginx-controller`.

Multi-tenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create
Ingress objects are most affected by this issue.

Affected Versions

ingress-nginx controller < v1.11.2

How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

This issue can be mitigated by upgrading to the fixed version.

Fixed Versions

ingress-nginx controller v1.11.2

Detection

Review your Kubernetes audit logs for Ingress objects created with
annotations (e.g. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-verify-client`)
that contain carriage returns (`\r`).

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please
contact security@...ernetes.io
