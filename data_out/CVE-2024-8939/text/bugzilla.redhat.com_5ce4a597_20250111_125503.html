The API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts a best\_of parameter to return the best completion from several options. When this parameter is set to a large value, the API does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a DoS by consuming excessive system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2312782#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-17 08:14:17 UTC  ``` An improper timeout handling vulnerability exists in the ilab model serve component, which wraps the vllm JSON web API for interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM). When processing completion requests, the API accepts a parameter best_of that can cause excessive processing time if set to a large value. This improper handling can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS), making the API unresponsive to legitimate users. The issue primarily affects instances where the API is exposed beyond localhost.   ``` |  |
