## A stack-based overflow vulnerability exists in the Microchip Advanced Software Framework (ASF) implementation of the tinydhcp server

#### Vulnerability Note VU#138043

Original Release Date: 2024-09-19 | Last Revised: 2024-09-19

---

### Overview

A stack-based overflow vulnerability exists in the tinydhcp server in the Microchip Advanced Software Framework (ASF) that can lead to remote code execution.

### Description

An implementation of DHCP in ASF fails input validation, thereby creating conditions for a stack-based overflow. The software is no longer supported by the vendor. Because this vulnerability is in IoT-centric code, it is likely to surface in many places in the wild.

**CVE-2024-7490**
There exists a vulnerability in all publicly available examples of the ASF codebase that allows for a specially crafted DHCP request to cause a stack-based overflow that could lead to remote code execution.

### Impact

This vulnerability can be tested by sending a single DHCP Request packet to a multicast address. This vulnerability exists in the current version of ASF 3.52.0.2574 and all previous versions of the software. There are also multiple forks of the tinydhcp software in github that are also potentially susceptible to this vulnerability.

### Solution

The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem other than replacing the tinydhcp service with another one that does not have the same issue.
