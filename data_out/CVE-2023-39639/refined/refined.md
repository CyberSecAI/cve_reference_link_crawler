- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Leo Blog` module for PrestaShop contains SQL injection vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied parameters in several methods. Specifically, the `link_rewrite` and `author_name` parameters are not properly escaped before being used in SQL queries within the `LeoBlogBlog::getListBlogs`, `LeoBlogBlog::countBlogs`, `LeoBlogBlog::findByRewrite` and `Leoblogcat::findByRewrite` methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection (CWE-89): The module fails to sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop.
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front end to expose tokens and unlock admins' AJAX scripts.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
    - Deploy web skimmers to steal credit card information.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attacks via HTTP requests. The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP call, targeting the `link_rewrite` or `author` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - No special privileges are needed, the vulnerability can be exploited by any guest user/unauthenticated attacker.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.
