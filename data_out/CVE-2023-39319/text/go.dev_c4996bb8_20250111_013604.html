| The html/template package did not apply the proper rules for handling occurances of "<script", "<!--", and "</script" within JS literals in <script> contexts. This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.

`[[release-branch.go1.21] html/template: properly handle special tags w…](/golang/go/commit/bbd043ff0d6d59f1a9232d31ecd5eacf6507bf6a "[release-branch.go1.21] html/template: properly handle special tags within the script context

The HTML specification has incredibly complex rules for how to handle
\"<!--\", \"<script\", and \"</script\" when they appear within literals in
the script context. Rather than attempting to apply these restrictions
(which require a significantly more complex state machine) we apply
the workaround suggested in section 4.12.1.3 of the HTML specification [1].

More precisely, when \"<!--\", \"<script\", and \"</script\" appear within
literals (strings and regular expressions, ignoring comments since we
already elide their content) we replace the \"<\" with \"\x3C\". This avoids
the unintuitive behavior that using these tags within literals can cause,
by simply preventing the rendered content from triggering it. This may
break some correct usages of these tags, but on balance is more likely
to prevent XSS attacks where users are unknowingly either closing or not
closing the script blocks where they think they are.

Thanks to Takeshi Kaneko (GMO Cybersecurity by Ierae, Inc.) for
reporting this issue.

# Original Information

The HTML specification has incredibly complex rules for how to handle
\"<!--\", \"<script\", and \"</script\" when they appear within literals in
the script context. Rather than attempting to apply these restrictions
(which require a significantly more complex state machine) we apply
the workaround suggested in section 4.12.1.3 of the HTML specification [1].

More precisely, when \"<!--\", \"<script\", and \"</script\" appear within
literals (strings and regular expressions, ignoring comments since we
already elide their content) we replace the \"<\" with \"\x3C\". This avoids
the unintuitive behavior that using these tags within literals can cause,
by simply preventing the rendered content from triggering it. This may
break some correct usages of these tags, but on balance is more likely
to prevent XSS attacks where users are unknowingly either closing or not
closing the script blocks where they think they are.

Thanks to Takeshi Kaneko (GMO Cybersecurity by Ierae, Inc.) for
reporting this issue.
