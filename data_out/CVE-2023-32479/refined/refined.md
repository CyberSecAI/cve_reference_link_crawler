Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the non-default installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege escalation vulnerability.
- Incorrect permissions on the installation directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local malicious user could replace binaries in the installed directory.
- This could lead to taking a reverse shell of the system.
- Ultimately, this results in privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access. The attacker must have a local user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- They need to be able to write to the installation directory, specifically replacing existing files/binaries.
- User interaction is required (UI:R)

**Affected Products:**
- Dell Encryption (versions prior to 11.9.0)
- Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise (versions prior to 11.9.0)
- Dell Security Management Server (Windows) (versions prior to 11.9.0)

**Remediated Versions:**
- Version 11.9.0 or later for all affected products.

**CVSS Score:**
- 6.7 (Medium)
- CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect directory permissions, allowing a local user to modify executable files.
- The attacker replaces binaries with malicious code, which executes with the privileges of the replaced binary.
- Dell recommends upgrading to version 11.9.0 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
