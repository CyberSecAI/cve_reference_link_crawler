## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# SEOPress < 7.8 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Post settings, which could allow high privilege users such as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, create a new Post, at the bottom of the page put the following payload in the "SEO Title" field and save: ;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&gt;<
The XSS will be triggered upon saving, as well as when any user will edit the post
