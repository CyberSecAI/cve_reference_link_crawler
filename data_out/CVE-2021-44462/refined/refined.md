Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-44462:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when parsing project files. Specifically, the software lacks proper validation of user-supplied data, which leads to reads and writes past the end of allocated data structures.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is improper input validation (CWE-20), which can cause out-of-bounds read/write operations.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves parsing maliciously crafted project files.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a valid user into opening a malicious HMI project file. This requires social engineering tactics, which means the attacker has to rely on user interaction to be successful.

**Additional notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that no known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, requiring local access or tricking the user into opening the malicious file.
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 with the vector string: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which further details that the attack vector is local, attack complexity is low, no privileges required, user interaction is required, scope is unchanged, confidentiality impact is high, integrity impact is high, and availability impact is high.
