##### VTS23-011

## NetBackup Snapshot Manager RabbitMQ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

### Revision History

* 1.0: July 26, 2023: Initial version
* 1.1: July 28, 2023: Updated Issue description
* 1.2: August 25, 2023: Added CVE ID

### Summary

A vulnerability was discovered in Veritas NetBackup Snapshot Manager which allowed untrusted clients to interact with the RabbitMQ service.

### Issue

The vulnerability was caused by improper validation of the client certificate due to misconfiguration of the RabbitMQ service. Exploiting this vulnerability impacts the confidentiality and integrity of messages controlling the backup and restore jobs and could result in the service becoming unavailable. This vulnerability impacts only the jobs controlling the backup and restore activities and does not allow access or deletion of the backup snapshot data itself. This vulnerability is confined to the NetBackup Snapshot Manager feature and does not impact the RabbitMQ instance on the NetBackup primary servers.

* CVE ID: [CVE-2023-40256](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40256)
* Severity: Critical
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))
