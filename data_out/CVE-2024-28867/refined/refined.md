Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of unsanitized string values in metric names or labels within the `swift-prometheus` library. Specifically, if user-controlled input is directly used to create metric names or labels, an attacker can inject malicious characters (like newlines, `}`, etc.) to manipulate the exported Prometheus metrics format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper sanitization of metric names and label keys before they are used by the library. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary characters that are not expected in the Prometheus exposition format.
*   **Unbounded Metric Creation:** By injecting malicious input into metric names or labels, an attacker can cause the creation of a large number of unique metrics. This is due to the way Prometheus stores distinct metrics based on unique names and label sets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The creation of a large number of metrics, especially with unique labels, can cause unbounded growth in the server's memory usage, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Metric Format Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the exported format, potentially injecting incorrect or "bogus" metrics that can mislead monitoring systems, possibly causing operational issues or masking malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is "Network," meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Query Parameter Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious characters through query parameters that are used in the application to construct metric names or labels. For example, `?lang=<malicious input>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without requiring any interaction from the user.
*   **Knowledge of Metric Usage:** The attacker needs to know how the application uses user input in the creation of metrics to craft specific exploits.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Patching:** The vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing the labels within the library. Metric names and label names are now validated against regex requirements: `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*` (metric names) and `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` (label names). However, label *values* are not validated by default, and developers are urged to sanitize them and only use expected values to prevent potential DoS attacks from unbounded metric growth.
*   **Mitigation:** It is strongly recommended that developers validate all user-supplied input before using them as metrics names or labels, even after applying the patch.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 5.9 (Moderate)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
    *   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
    *   **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
    *   **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
    *   **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
    *   **Confidentiality (C):** None (N)
    *   **Integrity (I):** High (H)
    *   **Availability (A):** None (N)
