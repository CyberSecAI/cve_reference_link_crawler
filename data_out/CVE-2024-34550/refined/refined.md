**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the Dynamics 365 Integration WordPress plugin that leads to sensitive data exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The plugin allows unauthorized access to sensitive information. The specific nature of this sensitive data is not detailed, but the impact is that it allows an attacker to potentially view sensitive information not available to regular users.
- **Inadequate Security Logging and Monitoring:** The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 A9, indicating failures in security logging and monitoring. This suggests that the plugin may not adequately log or monitor access to sensitive data, which could make detection of exploitation difficult.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** A malicious actor could view sensitive information that should normally be restricted. This could include configuration settings, user credentials, or other private data.
- **Exploitation of Other Weaknesses:** The exposed information could be used to exploit other weaknesses in the system. This could lead to a wider compromise.
