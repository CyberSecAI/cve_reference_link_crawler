- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `title` parameter for external links is not properly sanitized when saving in `links.php`. This unsanitized input is then stored in the database and reflected back to the user in `index.php`, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of input sanitization for the `title` parameter in external links.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Initially, the impact of the XSS was limited due to the short length allowed for the `title` parameter.
  - However, a crafted payload `<script/src=//â‘®.rs` was found to cause a denial of service (DoS) in the frontend, making the application unavailable. This payload prevents the console menu items from loading, effectively breaking the application's functionality through a stored XSS attack.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, and exploitation occurs through manipulating the `title` parameter when creating external links via an HTTP POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low-level privileges to create external links within the application. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by navigating to the console menu where the injected script executes.
