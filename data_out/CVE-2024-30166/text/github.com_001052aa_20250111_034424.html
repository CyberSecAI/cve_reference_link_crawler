## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides new features, bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.

This release brings in improved multithreaded operations, record-size-limit, and early-data support and other TLS1.3 improvements. TLS1.3 support is now enabled by default.

## Long-term support

Mbed TLS 3.6 is a long-term support (LTS) branch. It will be supported with bug-fixes and security fixes until at least March 2027.

## Security Advisories

For full details, please see the following link:

* [PSA Crypto API with parameters in shared memory](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-docs/blob/main/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2024-03.md)

> ❕ **Release notes are trunctuated in GitHub's releases page**: Please refer to the [3.6.0](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v3.6.0) release page.

## Release Notes

API changes

* Remove `tls13_` in mbedtls\_ssl\_tls13\_conf\_early\_data() and

  mbedtls\_ssl\_tls13\_conf\_max\_early\_data\_size() API names. Early data

  feature may not be TLS 1.3 specific in the future. Fixes [#6909](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6909).

Default behavior changes

* psa\_import\_key() now only accepts RSA keys in the PSA standard formats.

  The undocumented ability to import other formats (PKCS#8, SubjectPublicKey,

  PEM) accepted by the pkparse module has been removed. Applications that

  need these formats can call mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_{public,}key() followed by

  mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa().

Requirement changes

* Drop support for Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, and Arm Compiler 5.

New deprecations

* Rename the MBEDTLS\_SHA256\_USE\_A64\_CRYPTO\_xxx config options to

  MBEDTLS\_SHA256\_USE\_ARMV8\_A\_CRYPTO\_xxx. The old names may still

  be used, but are deprecated.
* In the PSA API, domain parameters are no longer used for anything.

  They are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the

  library.
* mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key() is deprecated in favor of

  mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key\_ext().

Removals

* In the PSA API, the experimental way to encode the public exponent of

  an RSA key as a domain parameter is no longer supported. Use

  psa\_generate\_key\_ext() instead.
* Temporary function mbedtls\_pk\_wrap\_as\_opaque() is removed. To mimic the

  same behavior mbedtls\_pk\_get\_psa\_attributes() and

  mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa() can be used to import a PK key into PSA,

  while mbedtls\_pk\_setup\_opaque() can be used to wrap a PSA key into a opaque

  PK context.

Features

* Added an example program showing how to hash with the PSA API.
* Support Armv8-A Crypto Extension acceleration for SHA-256

  when compiling for Thumb (T32) or 32-bit Arm (A32).
* AES-NI is now supported in Windows builds with clang and clang-cl.

  Resolves [#8372](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8372).
* Add new mbedtls\_x509\_csr\_parse\_der\_with\_ext\_cb() routine which allows

  parsing unsupported certificate extensions via user provided callback.
* Enable the new option MBEDTLS\_BLOCK\_CIPHER\_NO\_DECRYPT to omit

  the decryption direction of block ciphers (AES, ARIA, Camellia).

  This affects both the low-level modules and the high-level APIs

  (the cipher and PSA interfaces). This option is incompatible with modes

  that use the decryption direction (ECB in PSA, CBC, XTS, KW) and with DES.
* Support use of Armv8-A Cryptographic Extensions for hardware acclerated

  AES when compiling for Thumb (T32) or 32-bit Arm (A32).
* If a cipher or AEAD mechanism has a PSA driver, you can now build the

  library without the corresponding built-in implementation. Generally

  speaking that requires both the key type and algorithm to be accelerated

  or they'll both be built in. However, for CCM and GCM the built-in

  implementation is able to take advantage of a driver that only

  accelerates the key type (that is, the block cipher primitive). See

  docs/driver-only-builds.md for full details and current limitations.
* The CTR\_DRBG module will now use AES from a PSA driver if MBEDTLS\_AES\_C is

  disabled. This requires PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_ECB\_NO\_PADDING in addition to

  MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C and PSA\_WANT\_KEY\_TYPE\_AES.
* Fewer modules depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C, making it possible to save code

  size by disabling it in more circumstances. In particular, the CCM and

  GCM modules no longer depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C. Also,

  MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO can now be enabled without MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C if all

  unauthenticated (non-AEAD) ciphers are disabled, or if they're all

  fully provided by drivers. See docs/driver-only-builds.md for full

  details and current limitations; in particular, NIST\_KW and PKCS5/PKCS12

  decryption still unconditionally depend on MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_C.
* Add support for record size limit extension as defined by RFC 8449

  and configured with MBEDTLS\_SSL\_RECORD\_SIZE\_LIMIT.

  Application data sent and received will be fragmented according to

  Record size limits negotiated during handshake.
* Improve performance of AES-GCM, AES-CTR and CTR-DRBG when

  hardware accelerated AES is not present (around 13-23% on 64-bit Arm).
* Add functions mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_to\_psa() and mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_from\_psa()

  to convert between Mbed TLS and PSA curve identifiers.
* Add utility functions to manipulate mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair objects, filling

  gaps made by making its fields private: mbedtls\_ecp\_set\_public\_key(),

  mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_public\_key(), mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair\_calc\_public(),

  mbedtls\_ecp\_keypair\_get\_group\_id(). Fixes [#5017](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5017), [#5441](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/5441), [#8367](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8367), [#8652](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8652).
* Add functions mbedtls\_md\_psa\_alg\_from\_type() and

  mbedtls\_md\_type\_from\_psa\_alg() to convert between mbedtls\_md\_type\_t and

  psa\_algorithm\_t.
* Add partial platform support for z/OS.
* Improve performance for gcc (versions older than 9.3.0) and IAR.
* Add functions mbedtls\_ecdsa\_raw\_to\_der() and mbedtls\_ecdsa\_der\_to\_raw() to

  convert ECDSA signatures between raw and DER (ASN.1) formats.
* Add support for using AES-CBC 128, 192, and 256 bit schemes

  with PKCS#5 PBES2. Keys encrypted this way can now be parsed by PK parse.
* The new function mbedtls\_rsa\_get\_bitlen() returns the length of the modulus

  in bits, i.e. the key size for an RSA key.
* Add pc files for pkg-config, e.g.:

  pkg-config --cflags --libs (mbedtls|mbedcrypto|mbedx509)
* Add getter (mbedtls\_ssl\_session\_get\_ticket\_creation\_time()) to access

  `mbedtls_ssl_session.ticket_creation_time`.
* The new functions mbedtls\_pk\_get\_psa\_attributes() and

  mbedtls\_pk\_import\_into\_psa() provide a uniform way to create a PSA

  key from a PK key.
* The benchmark program now reports times for both ephemeral and static

  ECDH in all ECDH configurations.
* Add support for 8-bit GCM tables for Shoup's algorithm to speedup GCM

  operations when hardware accelerated AES is not present. Improves

  performance by around 30% on 64-bit Intel; 125% on Armv7-M.
* The new function psa\_generate\_key\_ext() allows generating an RSA

  key pair with a custom public exponent.
* The new function mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key\_ext() is similar to

  mbedtls\_ecp\_write\_key(), but can be used without separately calculating

  the output length.
* Add new accessor to expose the private group id member of

  `mbedtls_ecdh_context` structure.
* Add new accessor to expose the `MBEDTLS_PRIVATE(ca_istrue)` member of

  `mbedtls_x509_crt` structure. This requires setting

  the MBEDTLS\_X509\_EXT\_BASIC\_CONSTRAINTS bit in the certificate's

  ext\_types field.
* mbedtls\_psa\_get\_random() is always available as soon as

  MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_CLIENT is enabled at build time and psa\_crypto\_init() is

  called at runtime. This together with MBEDTLS\_PSA\_RANDOM\_STATE can be

  used as random number generator function (f\_rng) and context (p\_rng) in

  legacy functions.
* The new functions mbedtls\_pk\_copy\_from\_psa() and

  mbedtls\_pk\_copy\_public\_from\_psa() provide ways to set up a PK context

  with the same content as a PSA key.
* Add new accessors to expose the private session-id,

  session-id length, and ciphersuite-id members of

  `mbedtls_ssl_session` structure.

  Add new accessor to expose the ciphersuite-id of

  `mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_t` structure.Design ref: [#8529](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8529)
* Mbed TLS now supports the writing and reading of TLS 1.3 early data (see

  docs/tls13-early-data.md). The support enablement is controlled at build

  time by the MBEDTLS\_SSL\_EARLY\_DATA configuration option and at runtime by

  the mbedtls\_ssl\_conf\_early\_data() API (by default disabled in both cases).
* Add protection for multithreaded access to the PSA keystore and protection

  for multithreaded access to the the PSA global state, including

  concurrently calling psa\_crypto\_init() when MBEDTLS\_THREADING\_C and

  MBEDTLS\_THREADING\_PTHREAD are defined. See

  docs/architecture/psa-thread-safety/psa-thread-safety.md for more details.

  Resolves issues [#3263](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3263) and [#7945](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/7945).

Security

* Fix a stack buffer overread (less than 256 bytes) when parsing a TLS 1.3

  ClientHello in a TLS 1.3 server supporting some PSK key exchange mode. A

  malicious client could cause information disclosure or a denial of service.
* Passing buffers that are stored in untrusted memory as arguments

  to PSA functions is now secure by default.

  The PSA core now protects against modification of inputs or exposure

  of intermediate outputs during operations. This is currently implemented

  by copying buffers.

  This feature increases code size and memory usage. If buffers passed to

  PSA functions are owned exclusively by the PSA core for the duration of

  the function call (i.e. no buffer parameters are in shared memory),

  copying may be disabled by setting MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ASSUME\_EXCLUSIVE\_BUFFERS.

  Note that setting this option will cause input-output buffer overlap to

  be only partially supported ([#3266](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3266)).

  Fixes [CVE-2024-28960](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6h48-8w2f-5w94 "CVE-2024-28960").
* Restore the maximum TLS version to be negotiated to the configured one

  when an SSL context is reset with the mbedtls\_ssl\_session\_reset() API.

  An attacker was able to prevent an Mbed TLS server from establishing any

  TLS 1.3 connection potentially resulting in a Denial of Service or forced

  version downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2. Fixes [#8654](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8654) reported by hey3e.

  Fixes [CVE-2024-28755](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9w5c-29mx-552c "CVE-2024-28755").
* When negotiating TLS version on server side, do not fall back to the

  TLS 1.2 implementation of the protocol if it is disabled.
  + If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at build time, a TLS 1.2

    client could put the TLS 1.3-only server in an infinite loop processing

    a TLS 1.2 ClientHello, resulting in a denial of service. Reported by

    Matthias Mucha and Thomas Blattmann, SICK AG.
  + If the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at runtime, a TLS 1.2 client

    was able to successfully establish a TLS 1.2 connection with the server.

    Reported by alluettiv on GitHub.

    Fixes [CVE-2024-28836](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-39fv-p94v-rg6c "CVE-2024-28836").

Bugfix

* Fix the build with CMake when Everest or P256-m is enabled through

  a user configuration file or the compiler command line. Fixes [#8165](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8165).
* Fix compilation error in C++ programs when MBEDTLS\_ASN1\_PARSE\_C is

  disabled.
* Fix possible NULL dereference issue in X509 cert\_req program if an entry

  in the san parameter is not separated by a colon.
* Fix possible NULL dereference issue in X509 cert\_write program if an entry

  in the san parameter is not separated by a colon.
* Fix an inconsistency between implementations and usages of `__cpuid`,

  which mainly causes failures when building Windows target using

  mingw or clang. Fixes [#8334](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8334) & [#8332](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8332).
* Fix build failure in conda-forge. Fixes [#8422](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8422).
* Fix parsing of CSRs with critical extensions.
* Switch to milliseconds as the unit for ticket creation and reception time

  instead of seconds. That avoids rounding errors when computing the age of

  tickets compared to peer using a millisecond clock (observed with GnuTLS).

  Fixes [#6623](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/6623).
* Fix TLS server accepting TLS 1.2 handshake while TLS 1.2

  is disabled at runtime. Fixes [#8593](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8593).
* Remove accidental introduction of RSA signature algorithms

  in TLS Suite B Profile. Fixes [#8221](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8221).
* Fix unsupported PSA asymmetric encryption and decryption

  (psa\_asymmetric\_[en|de]crypt) with opaque keys.

  Resolves [#8461](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8461).
* On Linux on ARMv8, fix a build error with SHA-256 and SHA-512

  acceleration detection when the libc headers do not define the

  corresponding constant. Reported by valord577.
* Correct initial capacities for key derivation algorithms:TLS12\_PRF,

  TLS12\_PSK\_TO\_MS, PBKDF2-HMAC, PBKDF2-CMAC
* Fix mbedtls\_pk\_get\_bitlen() for RSA keys whose size is not a

  multiple of 8. Fixes [#868](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/868).
* Avoid segmentation fault caused by releasing not initialized

  entropy resource in gen\_key example. Fixes [#8809](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8809).
* mbedtls\_pem\_read\_buffer() now performs a check on the padding data of

  decrypted keys and it rejects invalid ones.
* Fix mbedtls\_pk\_sign(), mbedtls\_pk\_verify(), mbedtls\_pk\_decrypt() and

  mbedtls\_pk\_encrypt() on non-opaque RSA keys to honor the padding mode in

  the RSA context. Before, if MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO was enabled and the

  RSA context was configured for PKCS#1 v2.1 (PSS/OAEP), the sign/verify

  functions performed a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature instead and the

  encrypt/decrypt functions returned an error. Fixes [#8824](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8824).
* Fix missing bitflags in SSL session serialization headers. Their absence

  allowed SSL sessions saved in one configuration to be loaded in a

  different, incompatible configuration.
* In TLS 1.3 clients, fix an interoperability problem due to the client

  generating a new random after a HelloRetryRequest. Fixes [#8669](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/8669).
* Fix the restoration of the ALPN when loading serialized connection with

  the mbedtls\_ssl\_context\_load() API.
* Fix NULL pointer dereference in mbedtls\_pk\_verify\_ext() when called using

  an opaque RSA context and specifying MBEDTLS\_PK\_RSASSA\_PSS as key type.
* Fix RSA opaque keys always using PKCS1 v1.5 algorithms instead of the

  primary algorithm of the wrapped PSA key.
* Fully support arbitrary overlap between inputs and outputs of PSA

  functions. Note that overlap is still only partially supported when

  MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ASSUME\_EXCLUSIVE\_BUFFERS is set ([#3266](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3266)).

Changes

* Use heap memory to allocate DER encoded public/private key.

  This reduces stack usage significantly for writing a public/private

  key to a PEM string.
* PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_CCM and PSA\_WANT\_ALG\_CCM\_STAR\_NO\_TAG are no more synonyms and

  they are now treated separately. This means that they should be

  individually enabled in order to enable respective support; also the

  corresponding MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL symbol should be defined in case

  acceleration is required.
* Moved declaration of functions mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_to\_psa and

  mbedtls\_ecc\_group\_of\_psa from psa/crypto\_extra.h to mbedtls/psa\_util.h
* mbedtls\_pk\_sign\_ext() is now always available, not just when

  PSA (MBEDTLS\_PSA\_CRYPTO\_C) is enabled.
* Extended PSA Crypto configurations options for FFDH by making it possible

  to select only some of the parameters / groups, with the macros

  PSA\_WANT\_DH\_RFC7919\_XXXX. You now need to defined the corresponding macro

  for each size you want to support. Also, if you have an FFDH accelerator,

  you'll need to define the appropriate MBEDTLS\_PSA\_ACCEL macros to signal

  support for these domain parameters.
* RSA support in PSA no longer auto-enables the pkparse and pkwrite modules,

  saving code size when those are not otherwise enabled.
* mbedtls\_mpi\_exp\_mod and code that uses it, notably RSA and DHM operations,

  have changed their speed/memory compromise as part of a proactive security

  improvement. The new default value of MBEDTLS\_MPI\_WINDOW\_SIZE roughly

  preserves the current speed, at the expense of increasing memory

  consumption.
* Rename directory containing Visual Studio files from visualc/VS2013 to

  visualc/VS2017.
* The TLS 1.3 protocol is now enabled in the default configuration.
