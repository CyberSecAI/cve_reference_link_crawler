{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-28960",
      "Root cause": "Insecure handling of shared memory in PSA Crypto APIs.",
      "Weaknesses": "Passing buffers that are stored in untrusted memory as arguments to PSA functions without proper protection allows for modification of inputs or exposure of intermediate outputs during operations.",
       "Impact": "Information disclosure or denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can pass buffers stored in untrusted memory to PSA functions.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the contents of buffers passed to PSA functions."
    },
   {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-28755",
      "Root cause": "The maximum TLS version to be negotiated was not properly restored when an SSL context was reset.",
       "Weaknesses": "An SSL context reset with the mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() API did not restore the maximum TLS version to be negotiated, allowing an attacker to force a version downgrade.",
      "Impact": "Denial of Service or forced version downgrade from TLS 1.3 to TLS 1.2.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS handshake.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with an Mbed TLS server during the TLS handshake."
    },
   {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-28836",
      "Root cause": "Incorrect fallback behavior when negotiating TLS versions on the server side.",
      "Weaknesses":"The server would incorrectly fall back to the TLS 1.2 implementation if the TLS 1.2 implementation was disabled at build or runtime which results in denial of service or successful TLS 1.2 connection instead of TLS 1.3.",
       "Impact": "Denial of Service or establishing a connection using a disabled TLS 1.2 protocol version.",
      "Attack vectors": "A TLS 1.2 client can exploit this to cause an infinite loop or downgrade.",
      "Required attacker capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to connect to a server running Mbed TLS with TLS 1.3 enabled and TLS 1.2 disabled."
