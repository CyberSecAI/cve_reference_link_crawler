Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3136

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI)

**Affected Software:** MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 3.3.3

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `template` parameter. The plugin used to directly use the value of the `template` GET parameter to include files using a template loading function. This allowed attackers to specify arbitrary file paths on the server, bypassing intended access controls and potentially executing PHP code if the included file contained it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Direct File Inclusion:** The plugin used the user-supplied `template` parameter directly in file inclusion functions.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to adequately sanitize the input before using it to load a file.
- **Bypass Template System:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the intended template system by providing their own file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** Attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP code present in the specified file by including files with malicious code, leading to complete compromise of the server.
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can include files containing sensitive information leading to data breaches.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** Attackers can access files outside of the intended scope of the application
- **Complete control of the website:** The attacker can perform various malicious activities, like injecting malicious javascript, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The `template` parameter is passed via a GET request. The attacker crafts an HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint with the `template` parameter set to a file path of their choice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **No authentication is needed**

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The fix implemented in version 3.3.4 involves sanitizing the template name by using the `sanitize_template_name` method, which prevents path traversal attacks using the pattern `/(\.\.?\/|\\\+)/`.
- The vulnerable code snippet that was removed used  `stripslashes`, and `sanitize_text_field`, and `addslashes` on the template parameter. This was not sufficient as it did not prevent the access of file paths outside the intended template directory.
- The fix also uses `realpath` when locating files outside the theme to ensure the path is valid.
- The vulnerable code path can be located in `_core/lms/classes/helpers.php`, particularly in the section that handles the `template` parameter from a GET request.
- The `load_lms_template` function in `_core/lms/classes/templates.php` is involved in loading the template based on the provided parameter.

In summary, CVE-2024-3136 is a critical unauthenticated Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the MasterStudy LMS plugin. By sending a crafted request containing a malicious file path, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution or gain access to sensitive data.
