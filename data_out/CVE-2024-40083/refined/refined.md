- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `local_app_set_router_token()` function due to the use of `sscanf()` without proper bounds checking when parsing the "token" and "timezone" parameters from user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Buffer overflow: The `sscanf()` function reads data into fixed-size buffers (`token` and `timezone`) without validating the length of the input string, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): By overflowing the buffer, an attacker may be able to overwrite parts of the stack and potentially achieve remote code execution, leading to root access on the router.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network access: The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with access to the router's LAN (WiFi).
    - Custom protocol: The attacker needs to craft custom messages using the custom protocol on port 5432.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - LAN access: The attacker must be connected to the same network as the router (LAN).
    - Protocol knowledge: The attacker needs to understand and implement the custom protocol used by the local service on port 5432.
    - Unauthenticated access: No authentication is required to interact with the vulnerable service.
