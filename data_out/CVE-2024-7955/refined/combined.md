## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Starbox < 3.5.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=abh\_settings
2. Save the settings and intercept the request
3. Change the `abh\_titlefontsize` and/or `abh\_descfontsize` parameters to `333"test=' onmouseover=alert(779) test=' //`
4. Send the request.
5. When the page reloads, move your mouse over the username to see the XSS
