## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk < 2.51 - Security Nonce Leak leading to Unauthorised AJAX call

### Description

Security nonce leak, allowing any authenticated users (such as subscribers) to make unauthorised AJAX call which could lead to arbitrary file deletion/download and function call.

Note (WPScanTeam): We do not consider the issue fully remediated, as the AJAX calls rely on CSRF check for authorisation, instead of proper authorisation verification with the current\_user\_can() function. However, it would require chaining with other issues to be exploited.
