## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk < 2.51 - Security Nonce Leak leading to Unauthorised AJAX call

### Description

Security nonce leak, allowing any authenticated users (such as subscribers) to make unauthorised AJAX call which could lead to arbitrary file deletion/download and function call.

Note (WPScanTeam): We do not consider the issue fully remediated, as the AJAX calls rely on CSRF check for authorisation, instead of proper authorisation verification with the current\_user\_can() function. However, it would require chaining with other issues to be exploited.

# Multiple vulnerabilities fixed in Security and Malware Scan by CleanTalk plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [July 6, 2020 - 12:45pm [+0700]July 6, 2020 - 12:47pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/multiple-vulnerabilities-fixed-in-security-malware-scan-by-cleantalk-plugin/)

The [Security & Malware Scan by CleanTalk](https://wordpress.org/plugins/security-malware-firewall/) plugin for WordPress (5,000+ active installations) fixed a vulnerability affecting version 2.50 and below that could allow any authenticated user to interact with all its AJAX actions.

### Security Nonce Leak

The plugin registers 40+ AJAX actions in the “security-malware-firewall/inc/spbc-admin.php” script. Most of them do not check the user capability but rely only on a security nonce populated in the `spbc_enqueue_scripts` function:

```
292   function spbc_enqueue_scripts($hook) {
293
294      global $spbc;
295
296      // For ALL admin pages
297      wp_enqueue_style ('spbc_admin_css', SPBC_PATH . '/css/spbc-admin.min.css', array(), SPBC_VERSION, 'all');
298
299      wp_enqueue_script('spbc-common-js', SPBC_PATH . '/js/spbc-common.min.js', array('jquery'), SPBC_VERSION, false);
300      wp_enqueue_script('spbc-admin-js',  SPBC_PATH . '/js/spbc-admin.min.js',  array('jquery'), SPBC_VERSION, false);
301
302      wp_localize_script('jquery', 'spbcSettings', array(
303         'wpms'         => (int)is_multisite(),
304         'is_main_site' => (int)is_main_site(),
305         'tc_enabled'   => $spbc->tc_enabled ? 1 : 0,
306         'img_path'     => SPBC_PATH . '/images',
307         'key_is_ok'    => $spbc->key_is_ok,
308         'ajax_nonce'   => wp_create_nonce("spbc_secret_nonce"),
309         'ajaxurl'      => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
310         'debug'        => !empty($debug) ? 1 : 0,
311      ));

```

The function is loaded by the `admin_enqueue_scripts` hook, i.e., each time someone accesses the backend, in the “security-malware-firewall/security-malware-firewall.php” script:

```
292   add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', 'spbc_enqueue_scripts');

```

The nonce is therefore accessible to any logged-in user, including a subscriber, in the source of the HTML page:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/security-malware-scan-by-cleantalk-vulnerability_01.png)

An attacker could use it to interact with all AJAX actions, which could lead to multiple vulnerabilities from arbitrary file deletion and download to PHP function injection among other issues:

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the authors on June 04th, 2020 and a new version 2.51 was released on June 30, 2020.

### Recommendations

Upgrade immediately if you have version 2.50 or below. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Description

The Security & Malware scan by CleanTalk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user interaction in versions up to, and including, 2.50. This is due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions and nonce disclosure in the source page of the administrative dashboard. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to call functions and delete and/or upload files.
