Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **security nonce leak** and **missing authorization checks** in the "Security & Malware Scan by CleanTalk" WordPress plugin. The plugin exposes a security nonce via the `admin_enqueue_scripts` hook, making it accessible to all logged-in users, including subscribers.
*   Additionally, many of the plugin's AJAX actions lack proper user capability checks, relying only on the leaked nonce for authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Security Nonce Leak:** The nonce, intended for CSRF protection, is exposed in the HTML source, allowing any authenticated user to obtain it.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  AJAX actions fail to properly verify user capabilities (e.g. using `current_user_can()`), depending solely on the leaked nonce.
*   **CSRF reliance:** The AJAX calls rely on CSRF checks for authorization, instead of proper authorization verification with `current_user_can()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can use the leaked nonce to make unauthorized AJAX calls.
*   This could lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Unauthorized users can potentially delete files.
    *   **Arbitrary File Download:** Unauthorized users can potentially download files.
    *   **Arbitrary Function Call:** The attacker can invoke functions on the server.
    *   **PHP Code Injection:** Potential for injecting malicious PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is initiated through HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **AJAX Calls:**  The attacker leverages the plugin's AJAX actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a **logged-in user** on the WordPress site, including those with subscriber-level permissions.
*   The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to extract the leaked nonce from the HTML source.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in plugin versions **2.50 and below**.
*   Version **2.51** and later includes a fix.
*   The plugin authors were notified on June 4, 2020, and the fix was released on June 30, 2020.
*   While the immediate vulnerability is fixed, the use of CSRF check for authorization is not considered a complete fix by the WPScan team, and chaining with other issues could lead to exploitation.
