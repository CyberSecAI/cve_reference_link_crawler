- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ajaxmanager module allows unauthenticated access to a file explorer, shell console, port scanner, and server information. Additionally, a password protection mechanism is present but can be bypassed due to a bug.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unrestricted file upload of dangerous file types (CWE-434).
    - Unauthenticated access to sensitive tools (file explorer, shell console, etc.).
    - Bypass of password protection.
    - Access to database information and potentially administrative access to the website.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Remote attackers can upload malicious files.
    - Attackers can remove and alter files.
    - Attackers can remove and alter data in the database.
    - Attackers can obtain database passwords and cookie keys.
    - Attackers can gain complete admin access to the website.
    - Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server via shell access.
    - The module can be used as a backdoor.

- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction is needed; any remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
