- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the CmpApp component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability arises from crafted network communication requests with inconsistent content, causing the CmpApp component to read from an invalid memory address.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via network communication requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user to send the crafted network requests.
