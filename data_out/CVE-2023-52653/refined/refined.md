The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52653.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `gss_import_v2_context` function within the SUNRPC subsystem of the Linux kernel. The `ctx->mech_used.data` allocated using `kmemdup` is not freed if `gss_krb5_import_ctx_v2` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory is not released, leading to a potential resource exhaustion over time if the vulnerable function is called repeatedly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a memory leak, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and system instability if the vulnerable code path is repeatedly triggered.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path by sending specially crafted RPC requests that involve GSS authentication with Kerberos v5.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to make RPC requests to the affected system that use GSS/Kerberos authentication. This would likely require being on the same network or having access to the targeted service.
