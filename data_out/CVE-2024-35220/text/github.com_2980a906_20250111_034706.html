# Reuse of destroyed session cookie

High

[mcollina](/mcollina)
published
GHSA-pj27-2xvp-4qxg
May 21, 2024

## Package

npm

@fastify/session
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 10.8.0

## Patched versions

> 10.8.0

## Description

### Impact

When restoring the cookie from the session store, the `expires` field is overriden if the `maxAge` field was set.

This means a cookie is never correctly detected as expired and thus expired sessions are not destroyed.

### Patches

Updating to v10.9.0 will solve this.

### Workarounds

None

### References

Publicly reported at: [#251](https://github.com/fastify/session/issues/251)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
