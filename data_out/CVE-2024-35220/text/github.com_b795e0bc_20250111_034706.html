| Prerequisites  * I have written a descriptive issue title * I have searched existing issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported  Fastify version 4.27 Plugin version *10.8.0* Node.js version 20.12.0 Operating system Windows Operating system version (i.e. 20.04, 11.3, 10) 11 Description Fastify version: latest Node.js version: 20.12.0 NPM version: 10.2.0  For other versions please check out the package.json file  I'm using TypeScript and I'm trying to build a session-based-authentication system. I used to use express, but I've found many reasons why fastify is much better. So I'm using fastify/session as a session package. I'm using Prisma to store sessions. I've connected prism as the session store of fastify/session. It works fine.  But the problem is that **fastify/session does not delete expired sessions.** **Neither from memory nor from Prisma.** Only cookies are deleted and that is thanks to fastify/cookies. Instead of deleting the session from the fastify/session store, it gives the user a new session. You can say that there is no problem here, after all, it does not use the old session. But when we replace the cookie with the cookie of the old session and advance the expire time of the cookie (because fastify/cookies removes the cookie if we don't advance it), **it still allows us to access the old session.** (Check the video) This is a security vulnerability. How can I solve this?  And its not about the session storage which **I implement (prisma storage), if you delete this storage (that means you are using memory storage by default) same vulnerability is still valid.** How can I solve this? or any source can you suggest?  Check index.ts file, the related video and package.json file.  If fastify/session automatically destroys expired sessions, there will be no problem, but the destroy method I implemented in the store is never triggered. Can you help me?  Apologies for my english. Thanks.  Video (or you can also watch on youtube: <https://youtu.be/EXB0mhckHoc>):    Accessingoldsession.mp4     index.ts (which also available to inspect in github : [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Prag1974/fastify-ts)):  ``` import Fastify, { FastifyReply, FastifyRequest, Session } from "fastify"; import fastifyCookie from "@fastify/cookie"; import fastifySession from "@fastify/session"; import { db } from "./libs/db";  declare module "fastify" {   interface Session {     gotItFromBaseURL?: boolean; //This is just for test.     gotItFromTestURL?: boolean;   } }  const fastify = Fastify();  const PORT = 3000;  fastify.register(fastifyCookie, {}); fastify.register(fastifySession, {   store: { //If you dont implement your own storage and use default one, same vulnerability is still valid.     async set(       sessionId: string,       session: Session,       callback: (err?: any) => void     ) {       try {         await db.session.upsert({           where: {             id: sessionId,           },           update: {             data: session as any,           },           create: {             id: sessionId,             data: session as any,           },         });         return callback(undefined);       } catch (error) {         return callback(error);       }     },     async get(       sessionId: string,       callbackSession: (err: any, result?: Session) => void     ) {       try {         const storedSession = await db.session.findUnique({           where: { id: sessionId },         });         if (!storedSession) throw Error("Session couldn't found!");                  const session: Session = {           ...(storedSession.data as any),         };          callbackSession(undefined, session);       } catch (error) {         callbackSession(error, undefined);       }     },     async destroy(sessionId: string, callback: (err?: any) => void) {       try {         console.log("Destroy fired");         const deleted = await db.session.delete({ where: { id: sessionId } });         if (!deleted) throw Error("Couldnt found to destroy a session!");          callback(undefined);       } catch (error) {         callback(error);       }     },   },   secret: "supersecretkeysupersecretkeysupersecretkeysupersecretkey",   cookie: {     secure: false,     maxAge: 1000 * 15, // 15 seconds   }, });  fastify.get("/", (req: FastifyRequest, res: FastifyReply) => {   req.session.gotItFromBaseURL = true;   console.log(req.session.sessionId);   return res.send(req.session); });  try {   fastify.listen({ port: PORT });   console.log(`Server is listening port ${PORT}`); } catch (error) {   fastify.log.error(error);   process.exit(1); } ``` Link to code that reproduces the bug *No response* Expected Behavior *No response* |

| Automatic deletion is not provided for `@fastify/session`, just as it is not provided for `express-session`.  The following implementations should therefore be carried out.   * Database records should include an expires at * Check expires in store's get method * Delete expired data periodically  ---   Reference package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quixo3/prisma-session-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40quixo3/prisma-session-store)  Notes: The above package is not likely to be available as is due to peerDependencies. ( Same as [#224](https://github.com/fastify/session/issues/224) )   ---   Depending on the database you use, it can be automatically deleted on the database side, so I think the session library does not take care of database-specific matters. eg) For AWS dynamodb, just set TTL |

And if the fastify/sessions does not destroy them automatically, then what is the purpose of implementing destroy which the mandatory method for implementing your own session store (set, get, destroy), if it doesn't make sense, why fastify/sessions get us to implement it, what is the purpose? And checking if the session is expired in EVERY get request is unnecessary probably for 9 of 10 requests. And this is bad for the system. I guess it would be devouring for the server. |

| The memory store of `express-session@1.18.0` is not deleted unless the `all` method is called. Data that is not sent from the browser will not be deleted.   ---   `destroy` is called in onRequest hook. `destroy` is used when a cookie has an expiration date-time set and expires on the server side after the browser sends the cookie. Not called if you do not set the `maxAge` or `expires` options. <https://github.com/fastify/session/blob/v10.8.0/lib/fastifySession.js> Also, it seems that destroy is required to make store compatible with express-session.   ---   I would like to hear the views of this library's contributors. I feel like the memory store implementation is too simple. However, it is clearly stated that it should not be used in production, so I feel like this is fine. If you think it would be better to include precautions and implementation policies when using a database in the document, please update it. |

| @Prag1974 [@mcollina](https://github.com/mcollina) Sorry, the code reading was not very good.  Apparently there is a bug in the handling of `cookie.maxAge`.  <https://github.com/fastify/session/blob/v10.8.0/lib/fastifySession.js#L85-L105> `expires` is checked in the above code. However, `expires` is updated when restoring. <https://github.com/fastify/session/blob/v10.8.0/lib/session.js#L43> <https://github.com/fastify/session/blob/v10.8.0/lib/cookie.js#L15> <https://github.com/fastify/session/blob/v10.8.0/lib/cookie.js#L42>  Therefore, if the `cookie.maxAge` option is set, the expiration check will not work. The check works if you set the `cookie.expires` option. |

The check works if you set the `cookie.expires` option.  I know. But that is not the case. When the fastify session gives us a new session. That means the old one should be expired. But as in the video. We can access it and this is a vulnerability. Did you watch the video? |
