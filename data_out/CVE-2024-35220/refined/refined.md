Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how `@fastify/session` handles session expiration when using `maxAge` cookie option.  The `expires` field of a session cookie was being overridden during session restoration if the `maxAge` field was set. This caused the session to never be correctly detected as expired.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Expiration Handling:** The primary issue is that the `expires` value of the cookie, used to determine session validity, was being overwritten during the restoration process when `maxAge` was defined. This effectively bypassed the expiration mechanism.
*   **Session Reuse:** As a consequence of the incorrect expiration handling, expired sessions were not being destroyed.  An attacker could reuse an old session cookie, even after its intended expiration, to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by reusing expired session cookies, as the server wouldn't properly invalidate them.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** If session data contains sensitive information, this vulnerability could lead to a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:**  The attack is network-based, exploiting the way session cookies are handled over HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Valid Session Cookie:** An attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the server.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires some level of user interaction initially to generate a valid session cookie but does not require any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability after that.
*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions `<= 10.8.0` of the `@fastify/session` package.
*   The fix is available in version `> 10.8.0`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited even when using custom session stores (like Prisma), since the issue is related to how the core library handles expiration.
*   The vulnerability is described in GitHub Security Advisory [GHSA-pj27-2xvp-4qxg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pj27-2xvp-4qxg)
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration).
*   The CVSS v3 score is 7.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
