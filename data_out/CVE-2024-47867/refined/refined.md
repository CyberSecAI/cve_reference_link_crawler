- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of integrity check on the downloaded FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) client by the Gradio server. The server does not verify the file's checksum or signature after downloading it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing integrity check (checksum/signature verification) on downloaded FRP client, leading to a potential arbitrary code execution vulnerability if a man-in-the-middle attack is successful.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with control over the remote URL from which the FRP client is downloaded could replace the original binary with a malicious one. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when they use the Gradio server's sharing mechanism.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack on the network connection between the Gradio server and the remote URL serving the FRP client, or by compromising the server hosting the FRP client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate the network traffic or have access to the server hosting the FRP client in order to serve a modified version.
