{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of SQFS files, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (SQFS file).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted SQFS file that exploits the vulnerability when parsed by 7-Zip. User interaction is required."
