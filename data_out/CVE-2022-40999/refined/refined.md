The content is related to CVE-2022-40999.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `sprintf` to construct strings based on user-supplied input without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `sprintf` function copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer without validating the length of the input.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflows are present in the `DetranCLI` command parsing functionality.
- Input parameters (`WORD`, `CODE`, IP addresses, numerical ranges, and choices) are used in `sprintf` without checking their length before copying to stack buffers.

**Impact:**
- Exploitation can lead to arbitrary command execution.
- Attackers can send specially crafted network packets to trigger the buffer overflows.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network packets containing specially crafted commands through the `DetranCLI` interface.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device
- The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) in order to send commands to the `DetranCLI` interface.

**Specific Details for CVE-2022-40999:**

- Vulnerable command: `gre index <1-8> tunnel A.B.C.D source (A.B.C.D|null) dest A.B.C.D keepalive (on|off) interval (<0-255>|null) retry (<0-255>|null) description (WORD|null)`
- Vulnerable Code: `sprintf(buff_0x80,"%d<%s<%s<%s<%s<%d<%s<%s<%s>",1,*argv,argv[1],argv[2],argv[3],dependent_on_argv[4],argv[5],argv[6],argv[7]);`
- The `sprintf` copies data into `buff_0x80`, a buffer of size 0x80 bytes. The function does not check if the input parameters (`argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, `argv[3]`, `argv[5]`, `argv[6]`, `argv[7]`) will overflow this buffer.
