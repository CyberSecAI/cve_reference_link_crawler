*   **Product:** tianchoy/blog ([https://github.com/tianchoy/blog](https://github.com/tianchoy/blog))
*   **Version:** v1.8.8
*   **Problem Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `login.php` script.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The `user` parameter in the `login.php` script is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, leading to potential data breaches, modification, or deletion of data, or unauthorized access to the application and underlying database.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `user` parameter in a crafted HTTP request to `login.php`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `login.php` endpoint. No special privileges are required.
