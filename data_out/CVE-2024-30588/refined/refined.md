```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `setSchedWifi` function due to insufficient bounds checking on the `schedStartTime` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint with an overly long `schedStartTime` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. They would likely need to be on the same network or have access to the device's management interface."
