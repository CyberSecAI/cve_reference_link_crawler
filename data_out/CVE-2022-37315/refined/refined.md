Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `graphql-go` library's type definition parser. Specifically, the `parseTypeSystemDefinition` function enters an infinite recursion loop when parsing malformed input, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Infinite Recursion:** The parser fails to handle malformed input gracefully, resulting in a recursive loop that exhausts stack memory.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser doesn't properly validate or sanitize input, which can trigger the infinite recursion with a simple malformed string like `String r`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a stack overflow, causing the application to crash and become unavailable. This constitutes a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network exploitable, implying a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malformed Input:** The attacker can provide crafted, malformed input to the GraphQL parser to initiate the infinite recursion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be triggered without any user interaction, making it more easily exploitable.
*  **Network access** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable service to send malformed input.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   The vulnerability was discovered using a Go 1.18 fuzzer.
*   Multiple projects have patched this vulnerability including,  `Invizory/graphql-go`, `solidwall/graphql-go`, `tailor-inc/graphql`, `kubeops/ui-server`, and `sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot`.
*   The issue was fixed in version 0.8.1 of the `graphql-go` library.
*   The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-674: Improper Handling of Recursion.
