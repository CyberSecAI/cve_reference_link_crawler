### **[Hebing123](/Hebing123)** commented [Mar 11, 2024](#issue-2178252485) • edited Loading

| **Summary** VvvebJs version 1.7.4 exhibits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload malicious files onto the server, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code under the context of the webserver. **Details** The vulnerability arises from the 'save.php' file as it fails to implement adequate checks on the types of files being uploaded. The 'sanitizeFileName' function is designed to remove any unsecured characters and parameters from the filename and restrict the file extension to '.html'. However, the function fails to validate the user input properly, allowing an attacker to bypass these checks. Here is the relevant code snippet:   [VvvebJs/save.php](https://github.com/givanz/VvvebJs/blob/c6422cfd4d835c2fa6d512645e30015f24538ef0/save.php#L87-L89)  Lines 87 to 89 in [c6422cf](/givanz/VvvebJs/commit/c6422cfd4d835c2fa6d512645e30015f24538ef0)   |  | if (isset($\_POST['file'])) { | | --- | --- | |  | $file = sanitizeFileName($\_POST['file']); | |  | } |     In the code, $\_POST['file'] takes user input without proper filtering or verification. The filename provided by user input is assigned to the $file variable, which ultimately gets uploaded to the server without going through sufficient security measures.  **Proof of Concept (POC)** ``` POST /save.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.160.147 Content-Length: 60 Accept: */* X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.5735.289 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Connection: close  file=demo%2Flanding%2Findex.php&html=<?php%20phpinfo();%20?>  ```  After uploading the attacker accesses the URL:<http://192.168.160.147/demo/landing/index.php> [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/66168888/311593508-335a54b6-11a4-4c59-bbc3-be3372d468d5.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.aGEFdU4ojpzNB7VLaBboWo6gyERSuyl5eWNWF_Yt4rM) **Impact** Given that this is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability, an attacker can potentially upload any type of files, including malicious PHP scripts or web shells. After successful exploitation, an attacker may leverage the ability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the webserver, enabling them to carry out further attacks, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or escalating their privileges on the server. It is highly recommended that developers patch this vulnerability promptly. |
