- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected TBox RTUs generate software security tokens using insufficient entropy. The random seed used to generate the software tokens is not initialized correctly, and other parts of the token are generated using predictable time-based values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with knowledge of the token generation process could successfully brute force the token and authenticate themselves, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the affected devices, and the ability to exploit the insufficient entropy in token generation.
