| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-08 13:44:52 UTC  ``` The _XkbSetCompatMap() function attempts to resize the `sym_interpret` buffer. However, it didn't update its size properly. It updated `num_si` only, without `size_si`: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/blob/cdb4d5648a818a8e8ab282341be37109589229ab/xkb/xkb.c#L2998>  The exploit uses bitmap to achieve the arbitrary read and write. It leads to LPE for some distributions (xorg in debian xfce is run as root under specific display driver) and RCE for ssh x11 forwarding environment.  The exploit doesn't work if the OS installed on vmware and default virtualbox. It works on virtualbox with VBoxVGA graphic controller.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-04 08:14:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:8798 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8798](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A8798)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-13 14:32:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:9540 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9540](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9540)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-13 18:17:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9579 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9579](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9579)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-13 19:14:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2024:9601 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9601](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9601)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-14 18:40:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9690 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9690](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9690)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-18 01:20:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9818 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9818](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9818)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-18 01:27:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:9820 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9820](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9820)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-18 01:32:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:9819 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9819](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9819)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-18 01:32:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:9816 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9816](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9816)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-18 19:20:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2024:9901 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9901](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A9901)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2317233#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-20 11:57:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:10090 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10090](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10090)   ``` |  |
