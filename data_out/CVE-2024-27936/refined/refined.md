Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28446. While Deno attempts to strip ANSI escape sequences from permission prompts, it doesn't prevent the underlying permission request from being processed with the original, potentially malicious, input containing the ANSI escape sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** Deno inadequately sanitizes input used for permission requests. While display strings are sanitized, the actual request processing uses the original, unsanitized string.
- **ANSI Escape Sequence Injection:** The vulnerability is based on the ability to inject ANSI escape sequences into permission request strings.
- **Spoofed Permission Prompt:** A malicious program can manipulate the displayed prompt to mislead users about the actual permissions being requested.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Deception:** A malicious Deno program can trick users into granting permissions to sensitive resources by displaying a misleading permission prompt (e.g., a different file path than the actual one being accessed).
- **Access to Unauthorized Resources:** A malicious program can gain access to files, directories, or other resources that a user may not have intended to grant permissions for, due to the discrepancy between what is displayed and what is actually being requested.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Deno Scripts:** The primary attack vector is a malicious Deno script that crafts a permission request containing embedded ANSI escape sequences.
- **User Interaction:** The user is required to interact with the permission prompt, potentially being misled by the spoofed message, and grant the requested permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious Deno script.
- The attacker does not need to be local but can utilize remote code execution to run the malicious Deno script.
- The attacker needs to get the user to execute the malicious Deno script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Deno versions >= 1.32.1 and < 1.41.0, and deno\_runtime versions >= 0.103.0 and < 0.147.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Deno 1.41.0 and deno\_runtime 0.147.0, respectively.
- The fix involves highlighting unprintable characters in permission prompts instead of stripping them, making it clear to the user what is being requested.
