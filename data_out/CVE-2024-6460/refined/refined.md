- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of the `component` parameter in the `admin-ajax.php` request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI). Specifically, the `component` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP files present on the server, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to `admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `tm_load_data` and manipulating the `component` parameter to include a local PHP file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, and the attacker can be remote.
