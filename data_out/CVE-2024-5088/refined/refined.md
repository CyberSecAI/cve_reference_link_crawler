Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and output escaping of the `_id` parameter within the "Happy Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. This parameter is part of the skill bars widget functionality. Specifically, the code directly inserts the value of `skill['_id']` into the HTML without escaping it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `_id` parameter. This malicious code is then stored in the database and executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially perform actions such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, modifying page content, or taking over administrator accounts (if an administrator views the compromised content).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is launched remotely over the network (AV:N).
*   **Low Complexity:** The attack has a low attack complexity (AC:L) meaning it is not difficult to perform.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction in the sense that a user does not need to click a link, but the injected payload is executed when a user (victim) visits the affected page (UI:N).
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access (PR:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker must have a WordPress account with at least contributor-level privileges.
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker must have access to the plugin's settings where they can input data into the skill bars widget, specifically the `_id` parameter.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and how to exploit it.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `happy-elementor-addons/trunk/widgets/skills/widget.php`, specifically around line 363:
    ```php
    <div class="ha-skill ha-skill--<?php echo esc_attr( $settings['view'] ); ?> elementor-repeater-item-<?php echo esc_attr( $skill['\_id'] ); ?>">
    ```
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `_id` is properly escaped before being outputted as part of the HTML attributes. The provided diff shows the vulnerable line and the injected payload:

    +  $skill['\_id'] = $skill['\_id'] . '"onmouseover="alert(`payload1`)"'
     		<div class="ha-skill-level" data-level="<?php echo esc_attr( $skill['level']['size'] ); ?>">
     			<div class="ha-skill-info"><span <?php echo $this->get_render_attribute_string( $name_key ); ?>><?php echo esc_html( $skill['name'] ); ?></span><span class="ha-skill-level-text"></span></div>
    ```
    The `~~` characters indicate that the code was modified. In this instance, the attacker was able to inject arbitrary JavaScript, which is displayed on the onmouseover event within the HTML tag.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 3.10.8 and fixed in version 3.10.9.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-5088 is a stored XSS vulnerability within the "Happy Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin caused by a lack of proper input sanitization on the `_id` parameter. Attackers with Contributor level access or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is executed in the browsers of any user viewing a page containing the compromised widget.
