{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The wpa_supplicant service, when configured to use a shared object for extended functionality via the `opensc_engine_path` or `pkcs11_engine_path` parameters in its configuration file, does not validate the path of the specified shared object. This allows a user with control over the wpa_supplicant configuration file to load arbitrary shared objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of path validation for shared object loading in wpa_supplicant.",
      "Unrestricted access to the wpa_supplicant DBus interface by the `netdev` group.",
       "Insufficient checks on return values after bind() syscall which can be exploited using symlinks.",
      "Insufficient access control on cupsd configuration files",
       "Lack of input sanitization in the cups daemon when handling configuration files"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution as root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Compromise a user session to exploit Polkit rules, granting access to the `org.opensuse.cupspkhelper` DBus interface without needing the user's password.",
      "Manipulate the `cupsd.conf` file to make it world writable to gain full control via DBus.",
      "Use the `cupsd.conf` file to make the `cups-files.conf` world writable, allowing modifications to user and group settings for external programs.",
      "Exploit the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` in the PPD to execute a custom Python script.",
       "Use the python script to call the wpa_supplicant `CreateInterface` method to load a malicious shared object via `opensc_engine_path` or `pkcs11_engine_path` configuration parameters",
      "The shared object contains a payload that sets the Python binary as setuid root allowing for the final privilege escalation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code on the target system as a user in the 'sudo' or 'lpadmin' groups.",
      "Ability to write to the cups configuration files",
      "Ability to create symlinks",
      "Ability to interact with the wpa_supplicant DBus interface (requires netdev group membership)"
    ],
    "additional_information": "This CVE is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that allows for root privilege escalation. The exploitation involves using the cups printing system to modify files and parameters to ultimately gain control over the wpa_supplicant service. The vulnerability was mitigated by restricting the allowed paths for loading shared objects in wpa_supplicant to /usr/lib and by removing the call to chmod in cups"
