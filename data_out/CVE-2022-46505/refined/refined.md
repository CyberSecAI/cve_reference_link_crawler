- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flawed implementation of session resumption in MatrixSSL. The server uses a fixed-size array (`g_sessionTable`) to store session information. The first four bytes of the SessionID are used as a little-endian index into this array. When initializing, the `masterSecret` field in this array is set to all zeros. The server incorrectly handles a one-byte SessionID sent by a client which is then used to index the array where the `masterSecret` might be zero.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Insecure session ID handling**: The server does not properly validate the session ID length which can be a single byte instead of four bytes, leading to a lookup in the session table where the master secret could be all zeros.
    - **Default all-zero master secret**: During initialization, the `masterSecret` is initialized to all zeros, making it vulnerable to misuse if the server selects that specific entry during session resumption.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Decryption of TLS communication**: An attacker can force the server to use an all-zero master secret for a TLS session, allowing the attacker to decrypt the TLS communication data. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A malicious client can initiate a TLS handshake with the server and send a one-byte `SessionID` in a subsequent connection, forcing the server to use an all-zero master secret.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS connection with a vulnerable MatrixSSL server.
    - The attacker needs to control the `SessionID` sent to the server.
