The content is related to CVE-2024-28111.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `User-Agent` header, captured when HTTP-based Canarytokens are triggered, into exported CSV files without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection (CWE-1236) vulnerability.
- Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input (specifically the `User-Agent` header) before including it in a CSV file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution on the machine where the exported CSV file is opened, if opened in a vulnerable application like Microsoft Excel.
- Potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code, including a reverse shell, on the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker triggers an HTTP-based Canarytoken with a specially crafted `User-Agent` header.
- The Canarytoken owner then exports the incident history as a CSV file and opens it in a vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to discover a Canarytoken link.
- The attacker can then send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `User-Agent` header to trigger the token.
- No user interaction is required at the time of the attack but the user must later open the CSV file for the code to be executed.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes the patch details, which involves escaping the CSV field with a single quote to mitigate the injection.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `User-Agent` field and the use case of exporting incident data to CSV.
- The patch includes changes to `canarytokens/canarydrop.py` to address the sanitization issue.
