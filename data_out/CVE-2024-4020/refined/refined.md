  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `fromAddressNat` function in Tenda FH1206 Vx.x.x.x(8155) has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The `entrys` parameter from a POST request is assigned to the `Var` variable. This `Var` variable is then used in a `sprintf` operation to write data into `v6` buffer without proper size checks. The size of the `v6` array is 516 bytes, which can be overflowed by controlling the length of the `entrys` parameter from a POST request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation or size check on user-provided data.",
      "Use of sprintf without proper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE) if carefully crafted overflow data is provided.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/goform/addressNat` with a crafted `entrys` parameter.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a controlled `entrys` parameter. The attacker can achieve this via a network connection."
