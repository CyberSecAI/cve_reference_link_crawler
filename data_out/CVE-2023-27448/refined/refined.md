Root cause of vulnerability: The WordPress MakeStories (for Google Web Stories) Plugin <= 3.0.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSRF vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.

Impact of exploitation: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to perform, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access to resources.

Attack vectors:  A malicious actor can craft a request that, when submitted by a logged-in user, will trigger the vulnerable function. This can be done through social engineering, such as phishing links or embedding the malicious request into a website the victim visits.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker doesn't require any authentication themselves.
