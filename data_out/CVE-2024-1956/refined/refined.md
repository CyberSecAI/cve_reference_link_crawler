- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPB Show Core plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied parameters before outputting them in the response of an unauthenticated request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can then be executed by the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `subscribe.php` file within the plugin, specifically by injecting malicious code into the `countries` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to trick the victim into submitting the crafted form.
