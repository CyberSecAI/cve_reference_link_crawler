Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of resource management within M-Files Server, allowing an anonymous user to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The server doesn't properly limit the resource usage of anonymous user sessions.
*   **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)** (as stated on product.m-files.com):  This means the server allocates resources without proper checks or limitations, making it susceptible to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS against other anonymous users by consuming server resources excessively.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be launched over the network, as indicated by `AV:N` in the CVSS vector.
*   **Anonymous Access:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability; they can do so anonymously, as indicated by `PR:L` (low privileges, which, in the context of the description, translates to anonymous access)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the M-Files Server.
*   No special skills are required beyond the ability to use the normal M-Files Server functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue is described as a resource-based denial of service, specifically affecting other anonymous user sessions, meaning that an anonymous user's malicious behavior will impact other anonymous users.
* The vulnerability is present in M-Files Server versions before 24.2 (excluding 23.2 LTS SR7 and 23.8 LTS SR5).
* The probability of exploitation is considered low, as the issue was discovered internally.

The information provided is more descriptive than the CVE description, providing details about the nature of the DoS and who is affected, which are anonymous user sessions.
