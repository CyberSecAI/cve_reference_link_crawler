- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin uses comparison operators that do not mitigate time-based attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Time-based side-channel attack vulnerability due to insecure comparison operators.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information about the authentication codes can be leaked.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can observe the time it takes to perform the comparison and deduce information about the authentication codes being compared.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server and measure the response time.
