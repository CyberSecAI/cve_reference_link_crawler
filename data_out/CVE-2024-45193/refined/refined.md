Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Ed25519 signature verification implementation in the Olm library does not enforce the requirement that the 'S' component of the signature be less than the order of the curve ('n'). This allows for signature malleability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Ed25519 Signature Malleability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Olm library's Ed25519 implementation doesn't validate if  `S < n`  during signature verification. An attacker can take a valid signature `(R, S)` and create another valid signature `(R, n + S)` for the same message and public key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Signature malleability is generally considered a low-impact issue for most protocols, but its impact depends on how signatures are used in a given system. The specific impact in the context of Olm isn't detailed in the provided content, but the blog post implies that it can lead to issues in certain use cases, especially those involving cryptocurrency. It is described as "annoying".

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can manipulate valid Ed25519 signatures generated by Olm by adding the curve order to the 'S' component, resulting in a different but still valid signature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a valid Ed25519 signature generated by a vulnerable Olm implementation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post highlights that the root cause is a failure to validate  `S < n`  during the Ed25519 signature verification process.
- The blog suggests using the checks from libsodium to fix the issue.
- This vulnerability is one of three found in the Olm library (the others being an AES cache-timing vulnerability and a timing leakage in base64 decoding), but it is considered low impact compared to others.
- This finding is described as "annoying" to see in 2024.
