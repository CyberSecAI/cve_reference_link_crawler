- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings within the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient data protection, specifically for configuration settings which should not be visible to Read-Only administrators.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges to view device credentials that are normally not visible to users with these privileges. This would lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a remote attacker exploiting the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a Read-Only Administrator account and must be able to remotely access the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco ISE device. The attacker also needs to browse to specific page to trigger the vulnerability.
