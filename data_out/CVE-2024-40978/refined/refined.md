Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `qedi_dbg_do_not_recover_cmd_read()` function directly using `sprintf()` to write formatted output to a `__user` pointer. `__user` pointers point to memory in user space, and writing to them directly from the kernel without using proper functions like `copy_to_user` is unsafe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Direct User-Space Write:**  The primary vulnerability is the use of `sprintf()` with a `__user` pointer as the destination. This bypasses the necessary checks and mechanisms for safely transferring data between kernel and user space.
-   **Page Fault:**  When the kernel attempts to write to the user-space address directly, it causes a page fault because the address is not mapped in the kernel's address space. This triggers the kernel's page fault handler, which leads to a crash due to the invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Kernel Crash:** The immediate impact is a kernel crash due to the page fault when writing to an invalid memory address. This results in a denial of service.
-   **System Instability:** A kernel crash can lead to system instability and require a reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Reading debugfs attribute:** The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `do_not_recover` attribute in the qedi driver's debugfs. This means any process with the ability to read from this debugfs entry can trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to access debugfs:** An attacker needs to be able to open and read the debugfs file related to the `qedi_dbg_do_not_recover_cmd_read` function. This usually requires local access to the system or some privilege escalation if debugfs is restricted.

-       return cnt;
 }
```

The fix replaces direct `sprintf` to the user buffer with a local buffer `buf`. The formatted string is written to `buf` and then `simple_read_from_buffer()` function is called, which internally uses `copy_to_user()` to safely transfer the data to user space.

**In summary:** The vulnerability arises from writing directly to a user-space address, leading to a page fault and kernel crash. The fix uses a local buffer and `simple_read_from_buffer()` to safely transfer the data to user space.
