Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9027

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the 'box' shortcode of the WPZOOM Shortcodes plugin. Specifically, the `icon` attribute is not sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper sanitization and escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of attacker-supplied JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they visit a page containing the malicious shortcode.
- **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. They could also manipulate the content of the website or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access to accounts on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the `box` shortcode and injecting malicious code within the `icon` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or modify posts/pages where the shortcode is used.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know how to use the plugin's shortcode and the vulnerable attribute.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located within the `wpz_plugin_shortcode_box` function in `shortcodes/shortcodes.php` file.
- The plugin is closed and no patch is available so users are advised to uninstall the plugin.
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium).
