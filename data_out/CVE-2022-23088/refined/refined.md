- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 802.11 beacon handling routine in FreeBSD's net80211 kernel subsystem fails to validate the length of an IEEE 802.11s Mesh ID before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow due to missing length validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious beacon frame can overwrite kernel memory, potentially leading to remote code execution on a vulnerable FreeBSD Wi-Fi client while in scanning mode.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted 802.11 beacon frames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be in a position to transmit malicious Wi-Fi beacons that can be received by a vulnerable FreeBSD client in scanning mode (i.e., not associated with a SSID).
