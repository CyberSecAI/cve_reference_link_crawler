Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20230:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper encoding of the authority part of a URI before it's displayed in the UI. According to RFC2396, only reserved, unreserved characters, and '@' should appear unescaped. Other characters in the authority part of the URI should be escaped. The `android.net.Uri` class was not consistently enforcing this rule, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper URI encoding. Specifically, the authority portion of a URI was not being escaped according to RFC 2396 standards when displayed in the UI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability is categorized as an Information Disclosure (ID) issue with a High severity. Although the provided document does not explicitly state how the information could be exposed, the improper encoding can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data contained within the URI's authority section or facilitate other attacks (e.g., spoofing).

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious URI that includes unescaped characters in its authority part, which when processed and displayed by a vulnerable application could leak information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply or cause a vulnerable application to process a specially crafted URI. This could involve tricking the user into clicking on a malicious link or, if the vulnerability is exposed in a broader API, through other means of data injection.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this issue involves encoding the authority part of the URI before displaying it in the UI, ensuring that only allowed characters appear unescaped.
- The commit message indicates that this issue was addressed to conform with RFC 2396, which defines the standard syntax for URIs.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 10, 11, 12, and 12L.
