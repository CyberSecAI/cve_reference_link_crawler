- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the Signature Input Field, allowing for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Additionally, the Content Security Policy (CSP) is bypassed by uploading a malicious JavaScript file to the server and then referencing it in the signature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stored XSS vulnerability in the signature input field.
    - Insufficient input sanitization of user-provided data.
    - Bypassed CSP policy by uploading a javascript file to the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Full compromise of the FreeScout application by forcing an administrator to unknowingly execute malicious actions.
    - Privilege escalation by forcing the administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker or elevate the privileges of an attacker-controlled user.
    - Potential for sensitive information theft like login credentials, session tokens, PII, and financial data.
    - Application defacement
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attack through the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker needs to have an account with "Edit Signature" permission (Support Agent role).
    - Ability to upload files to the `/conversation/upload` endpoint.
    - The attacker requires user interaction from an administrator to trigger the XSS payload.
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
    - The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user to escalate privileges to administrator.
