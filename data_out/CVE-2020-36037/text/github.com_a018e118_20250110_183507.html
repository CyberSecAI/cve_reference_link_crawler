| The location where the vulnerability was triggered： `/coreframe/app/attachment/admin/index.php`  Locate the function "ueditor", when the parameter "submit" exists, the value of "setting" will be passed to the function "set\_cache" for execution. When the parameter "submit" does not exist, the content of the cache file will be executed directly;  [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102787198-a9c39c80-43db-11eb-948b-0e3df178bc66.png)  The "set\_cache" function does not filter the variable "data" (the parameter "setting" passed in) and saves it directly in the cache file:  [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102787654-60278180-43dc-11eb-94c0-e8a1354dcbe7.png)  The saved cache file path is: /caches/*cache*/ ueditor.dt72K.php  [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102787738-85b48b00-43dc-11eb-9a11-fc9f34665963.png)  So we can construct the following poc：  `http://192.168.114.150/index.php?m=attachment&f=index&v=ueditor&_su=wuzhicms&submit=1&setting=<?php echo phpinfo();?>` Vulnerability recurrence First：log in system  Second：Execute poc: [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102789084-9cf47800-43de-11eb-822e-ac600f89994f.png)  You can see that the shell file is successfully written:  [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102789104-a382ef80-43de-11eb-9de0-0d7917d31be2.png)  Third：Visit:  `http://192.168.114.150/index.php?m=attachment&f=index&v=ueditor&_su=wuzhicms`  You can see the successful execution of the shell script:  [图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54022042/102789126-aa116700-43de-11eb-943d-f6202fd68108.png) Repair method Strictly filter the parameter setting; |
