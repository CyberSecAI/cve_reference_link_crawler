- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mtrace2 code in Cisco IOS XR Software does not properly handle packet memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of packet memory when processing Mtrace2 packets. Specifically, the code does not properly release memory allocated to incoming UDP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exhaust the incoming UDP packet memory of the affected device, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device will not be able to process higher-level UDP-based protocol packets.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted Mtrace2 packets to the affected device via IPv4 or IPv6.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They must be able to send crafted UDP packets to the device on port 33433.

The advisory also notes:
- The vulnerability is triggered by the multicast RPM being installed and active.
- For IOS XR releases 24.1.1 and later, multicast also needs to be configured.
- The specific vulnerable port for Mtrace2 on Cisco IOS XR is UDP port 33433, instead of the standard 33435.
- The advisory provides methods to check if the multicast RPM is active and if Mtrace2 processing is enabled on the device using CLI commands.
- It provides mitigation strategies including deactivating the multicast RPM, using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to block port 33433, and restarting the IGMP/MLD processes as a temporary measure.
- It provides detailed information on fixed software releases and SMUs.
