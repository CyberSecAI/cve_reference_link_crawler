  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow in the `cmdinput` parameter within the `formexeCommand` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The stack overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through the `cmdinput` parameter of the `formexeCommand` function."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted `cmdinput` parameter to trigger the overflow. The content does not specify how, but this likely requires network access to the vulnerable device or service."
