# Unquoted executable path could lead to hijacked execution flow

Moderate

[ReenigneArcher](/ReenigneArcher)
published
GHSA-r3rw-mx4q-7vfp
May 16, 2024

## Package

sunshine

## Affected versions

>= 0.17.0, < 0.23.0

## Patched versions

v0.23.0

## Description

### Impact

Users who ran Sunshine as a service on Windows may be impacted when terminating the service if an attacker placed a file named `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program.bat`, or `C:\Program.cmd` on the user's computer. This attack vector isn't exploitable unless the user has manually loosened ACLs on the system drive.

The `lpCommandLine` parameter passed to `CreateProcessAsUser()` was initialized using the path returned from `GetModuleFileName()` which is not enclosed in quotes. As a result, the [Microsoft documented executable search logic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw) is used to locate the desired executable, which tries `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program.bat`, or `C:\Program.cmd` before the expected `C:\Program Files\Sunshine\tools\sunshinesvc.exe` file.

If the user's system locale is not English, then the name of the executable will likely vary. The executable name is based on the `Program Files` directory name.

### Patches

v0.23.0

### Workarounds

* Identify and block potentially malicious software executed path interception by using application control tools, like Windows Defender Application Control, AppLocker, or Software Restriction Policies where appropriate.
* Ensure that proper permissions and directory access control are set to deny users the ability to write files to the top-level directory `C:`. Require that all executables be placed in write-protected directories.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @cgutman **[cgutman](/cgutman)** commented [Apr 6, 2024](#issue-2229427146)

## Description

The path to sunshinesvc.exe needs to be quoted because it probably contains spaces, otherwise `CreateProcess()` will run `C:\Program.exe` if it's present. Fortunately, `C:\` prohibits ordinary user writes, so this type of bug isn't exploitable unless the user has manually loosened ACLs on the system drive.

For good measure, let's just pass the path directly to `CreateProcess()` to avoid all the executable searching nonsense.
