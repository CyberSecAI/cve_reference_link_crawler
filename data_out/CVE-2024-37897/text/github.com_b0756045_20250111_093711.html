# Insufficient access control for password reset

Moderate

[drakkan](/drakkan)
published
GHSA-hw5f-6wvv-xcrh
Jun 20, 2024

## Package

gomod

sftpgo
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= v2.2.0, < v2.6.1

## Patched versions

v2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support password reset. This feature is disabled in the default configuration.

In SFTPGo versions prior to v2.6.1, if the feature is enabled, even users with access restrictions (e.g. expired) can reset their password and log in.

### Patches

Fixed in v2.6.1.

### Workarounds

The following workarounds are available:

* keep the password reset feature disabled.
* Set a blank email address for users and admins with access restrictions so they cannot receive the email with the reset code and exploit the vulnerability.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-37897

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
