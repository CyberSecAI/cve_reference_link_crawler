Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `reboot_commit.php` script of the Ruijie RG-UAC product. Specifically, the `servicename` parameter, which is user-controlled, is directly incorporated into an `exec` function without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary OS commands through the `servicename` parameter. The code directly passes this user-supplied input to the `exec` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Ruijie RG-UAC application. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server, allowing for data theft, system manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/view/systemConfig/reboot/reboot_commit.php`.
*   **Malicious `servicename` Parameter:** The attack involves crafting a malicious `servicename` parameter within the POST data that includes commands to be executed on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Ruijie RG-UAC device.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL `/view/systemConfig/reboot/reboot_commit.php` and the vulnerable parameter `servicename`.
*   **Authentication might be required:** The provided exploit uses a `PHPSESSID` cookie, suggesting that authentication may be required.

**Technical Details:**
The provided code snippet shows that if `$rebootmode` is not equal to 1, the `$servicename` variable is passed directly to the `exec` function.

**Example Exploit (PoC):**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability using a `sleep` command, which delays execution, as a method to show successful injection:

```
POST /view/systemConfig/reboot/reboot_commit.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 45

rebootmode=222&servicename==`sleep${IFS}10`;1
```
In this PoC, the `servicename` parameter is crafted to execute the `sleep 10` command.  `IFS` is used to introduce a space, as spaces are normally used as command separators. The semicolon (`;`) allows chaining of the command, allowing a command after the sleep.
