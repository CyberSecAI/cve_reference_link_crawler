# OOB Vulnerability In ESP-NOW Group Type Message

Moderate

[lhespress](/lhespress)
published
GHSA-q6f6-4qc5-vhx5
Sep 12, 2024

## Package

ESP-NOW

## Affected versions

<= 2.5.1

## Patched versions

2.5.2

## Description

### Impact

An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the `ESP-NOW` group type message because there is no check for the **addrs\_num** field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks.

Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked, i.e., the **addrs\_num** field and the **addrs\_list** fileld. Since we only checked the **addrs\_list** field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid **addrs\_num** field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.

### Patches

Patched versions of `ESP-NOW` are listed below:

| Branch | Commit ID |
| --- | --- |
| master | [b03a1b45](https://github.com/espressif/esp-now/commit/b03a1b4593713fa4bf0038a87edca01f10114a7a) |

### Workarounds

The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of `ESP-NOW` component from [ESP Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/).

Please consider updating to `ESP-NOW` release containing the fixes mentioned above. Alternatively, the fixes can also be cherry-picked in your codebase.
