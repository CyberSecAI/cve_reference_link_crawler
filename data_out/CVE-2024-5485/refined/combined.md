### CONNECT YOUR WORDPRESS PLUGINS, APPS & WEBSITES TO CREATE POWERFUL AUTOMATIONS ‚ö°

At SureTriggers, our mission is to empower you to connect your favorite apps, automate repetitive tasks, and unlock new growth opportunities for your business.

Today, running a business means dealing with a lot of different apps, services, and plugins. On average, organizations use 110 different softwares to run their business.

Contact forms, Email marketing tools, Social media sites, Payment gateways, CRMs, Helpdesk, eCommerce plugins, Communication tools, Project management platforms, LMS, and the list goes on.

That‚Äôs a lot of moving pieces!

Now the problem is, these are all independent tools. They usually can not communicate with one another, causing a lot of time and energy wasted on manual data entry and other mundane tasks. It also means opportunities are lost when important apps are not connected.

Just for an example, imagine a small business owner named Jane. She runs an eCommerce website. When someone places an order on her website, this is what she wants to do:

* Add a customer to a CRM
* Add the order details to an accounting system.
* Upload the invoice to a Google Drive folder that is shared with the accountant
* Send a thank-you email to the customer
* Then, send this customer another email after 15 days asking for a review.
* If the customer leaves a five-star review, send a coupon encouraging the next purchase.
* If the customer does not use the coupon, remind them of it 3 days before it expires
* She also wants to get a notification of any order above $500 USD in a Slack channel
* Also for those large orders, send a message on WhatsApp to make the customer feel special and build a better relationship with them.

This is just one simple use case of a small business owner, trying to run and grow her simple eCommerce website. It is just impossible to manually do all of these tasks for each and every order that comes through her website!

That‚Äôs why we created SureTriggers.

SureTriggers is an automation platform that automates processes between different websites, applications, and WordPress plugins. It helps you create powerful workflows to connect your apps and automate repetitive tasks. It can automatically do any number of things in different apps, after something happens.

For example:

* What happens after someone buys a product
* What happens after someone leaves a review
* What happens after someone logs into your website
* What happens after someone fills out a contact form
* What happens when someone takes a quiz in an online course and achieve a certain score

Now there are some tools, like Zapier that might help you do some of this. However, they do not connect well with WordPress and are quite expensive. Furthermore, they were made years ago, and their user experience leaves a lot to be desired.

Furthermore, many WordPress automation tools suffer from limited integrations, are bloated, and can slow down your website. They require a lot of technical knowledge to use and yet are unreliable.

SureTriggers is different.

SureTriggers is the only platform built specifically to seamlessly integrate with WordPress and external applications. We have a modern user interface that is easy to use, and our platform is designed to be lightweight and fast.

And most importantly, it doesn‚Äôt break the bank.

Now Jane can easily connect her website to her CRM, accounting system, email marketing platform, and other apps she wants.

SureTriggers is our way to make sure that businesses, like Jane, can connect their favorite apps, automate mundane tasks, and focus on what truly matters ‚Äî discover new growth opportunities üìàüôÇ

### DISCLAIMER:

SureTriggers is a SaaS platform and requires an account on our website. When you install this plugin, you‚Äôll need to register for a free account. Or, if you already have an account with us, you can simply connect this plugin to it.

This plugin helps you connect your WordPress website to the SureTriggers SaaS platform.

### HOW IT WORKS ‚ùì

From installation to creating your first automation, SureTriggers is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here is how it works:

### Step 1. Install WordPress Plugin üîå

From your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click on the ‚ÄúAdd New‚Äù button. Search for the SureTriggers plugin, then click ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù and ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù.

### Step 2. Connect your WordPress website ‚öôÔ∏è

Once the plugin is installed, you will be redirected to the SureTriggers settings page in your WordPress dashboard. There you will find a button to connect your WordPress website with the SureTriggers platform. If you do not have an account on the platform, you can create it for free in less than 60 seconds. Or if you already have an account, just sign in with your login credentials.

All compatible plugins, such as WooCommerce, Fluent Forms, LearnDash, BuddyBoss, etc., will automatically connect to the SureTriggers platform during this process. Yaay, you‚Äôre almost ready to start automating tasks on this website!

### Step 3. Connect other apps üîó

If you want to connect other apps and websites such as Google sheets, MailChimp, Twitter, Stripe, Trello, etc. you can do that now. Just select the apps you use, and follow the instructions to connect your accounts.

SureTriggers already support hundreds of popular apps, and we‚Äôre adding more each week!

### Step 4. Choose a trigger üí£

After you‚Äôve connected your apps, you can set up triggers that will start a special task. A trigger is something that happens in one of your connected apps, like receiving a new order in your eCommerce platform.

### Step 5. Add actions ‚ö°

Now you can choose what you want SureTriggers to do whenever your chosen trigger is executed. Just pick the app and action you want to use. For example, you might want to pass the details of the customer who placed the order in your email marketing platform like MailChimp.

Now whenever the trigger happens, all the actions will be executed automatically. You can create similar automations to connect your favorite apps, automate mundane tasks, and discover new growth opportunities!

### SOME OF THE POWERFUL FEATURES üí™

SureTriggers is packed with advanced features that will help you streamline your processes and save time. Below are just some of the advanced features it offers:

### Canvas Builder üíô

Our standout feature is our intuitive canvas editor in SureTriggers. It lets you visually construct your automations by dragging triggers and actions onto the canvas. This makes it simple to visualize your workflow and make adjustments or expansions without coding.

### Multi-step automations üéâ

You can make multi-step automations that link actions triggered by events. For instance, you could set up a customer welcome process with emails, course enrollment, and adding to a mailing list. This helps you automate tasks and save time.

### Integrations with WordPress plugins ü§ò

SureTriggers works smoothly with popular WordPress plugins like Gravity Forms, WooCommerce, LearnDash, TutorLMS, FluentCRM, BuddyBoss, CartFlows, SureMembers, Elementor, and more. This allows users to automate actions such as post-purchase processes, website logins, form submissions, course enrollments, quiz completions, and specific score achievements, saving time and effort.

### Integrations with SaaS applications ü™©

SureTriggers connects with lots of apps, so you can link your favorites together. Want your CRM to talk to your email tool? Or your project manager to sync with your invoicing? SureTriggers does it. With a few clicks, set up automations to save time and get more done.

### Automation between multiple WordPress sites üîó

Want to connect one WordPress website to another? For example, if you have WooCommerce installed on one site and LearnDash on another. And whenever someone buys a WooCommerce product, you might want to offer access to a related course which is on another WordPress installation. SureTriggers makes it extremely easy.

### Schedule ‚è±Ô∏è

The Schedule feature lets you choose when your automations happen. You can pick a time and date for a one-time event or set them to repeat regularly. For instance, you could send a Slack reminder every Friday or back up your website every night. This simplifies tasks that need to be done regularly, fitting your business schedule, whether it‚Äôs daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

### Conditions üññ

SureTriggers‚Äô Conditions feature allows you to personalize your automations by setting rules for when actions happen. This helps make your automations more precise, quick, and adaptable. You can use Conditions to do tasks like sending messages, updating lists, emailing again, posting on social media, and assigning jobs to team members.

### Filter üé≤

This feature is handy in automations with many steps. It lets you decide if the automation keeps going or stops based on a condition. For example, if a customer hasn‚Äôt bought anything in 30 days, the automation continues. But if they have, it stops. This control helps you manage your automations better.

### Path üéä

The Path feature lets you make automations that can choose different actions depending on specific conditions. For instance, you can create an automation that sends one email if a customer‚Äôs purchase is big and another if it‚Äôs small. It helps automate decisions by creating different paths based on conditions.

### Delay ‚åõ

SureTriggers‚Äô delay feature is handy for adding timing pauses between actions in automations. For instance, you can send a personalized email to customers 90 minutes after they buy something to make them feel valued. Later, you can send another email asking for a review after 15 days.

### Formatters üòé

SureTriggers Formatter helps you tidy up your data and do calculations easily. It has tools to format, extract, and calculate data the way you want. You can change dates, times, currency, do math, and more. It‚Äôs all done with a simple, visual interface.

### Custom APIs ‚û°Ô∏è

SureTriggers can share information between your automations and other apps online using APIs. This means you can make something happen in another app when a task finishes in SureTriggers. For example, you could make SureTriggers send a message on Slack whenever someone orders from your website. Now, you can link your automations to any app that can get API requests fast and easy.

### Incoming Webhooks ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

SureTriggers uses incoming webhooks to get data from other apps or sites, triggering automations. For example, when someone applies for a job on your site, SureTriggers can send them a WhatsApp message by receiving application data through a webhook.

### Dynamic data mapping üî•

Dynamic Data Mapping in SureTriggers lets you easily share info between apps. Say you run an online store with WooCommerce and want to send SMS with Twilio. It automatically links customer details like name, phone number, and order info from WooCommerce to Twilio.

### Detailed logs and history üìú

SureTriggers‚Äô Detailed Logs and History feature helps you keep tabs on how well your automations are doing and fix any problems. It shows you exactly what happened at each step.

## FAQ

### Do I need coding skills to create automations?

No, you don‚Äôt need any coding skills to create automation with SureTriggers! The platform offers a user-friendly interface and a visual workflow builder, allowing you to create automations by dragging and dropping triggers and actions. This means that you can create automations without having to write any code or have any technical expertise.

Whether you‚Äôre a small business owner, a freelancer, or just someone who wants to save time and streamline their workflows, SureTriggers makes it easy to create automations without any coding skills.

### How does SureTriggers compare to other platforms like Zapier?

SureTriggers is the only automation platform that is built from the ground up to specifically integrate with WordPress and outside applications. This makes it a powerful and versatile tool for automating tasks within WordPress and between WordPress and external apps and services.

One of the key features of SureTriggers is its modern and user-friendly interface, which makes it easy for users to create automations by connecting different apps and services and defining triggers and actions, whereas Zapier feels overwhelming and complicated yet does not offer flexibility that is necessary for creating advanced automations.

In addition to its powerful features and ease of use, SureTriggers offers a sensible pricing, making automations accessible to everyone regardless of their financial status.

### How does SureTriggers compare to WordPress automation plugins?

SureTriggers offers a dedicated plugin to connect your WordPress website with our cloud platform. This allows users to automate tasks both within WordPress and outside of WordPress.

One of the key advantages of using SureTriggers is that all of the heavy lifting, such as managing queues, webhooks, and integration requests, is done on the cloud platform. This means that your WordPress website stays lean, fast and lightweight.

On the other hand, WordPress plugins that offer automation features need a lot of server resources. They make your servers manage queues, save a huge number of log entries in the database, take webhooks, and integration requests. WordPress is not made for such things. It is developed to be a content management system.

### Is SureTriggers a cloud-based platform or is it a WordPress plugin?

SureTriggers is a cloud based automation platform that also offers a WordPress plugin. This plugin serves as a bridge between your WordPress website and the platform. All the heavy lifting necessary for automations is done on the cloud platform, which keeps your website lean, fast and reliable.

### Some of my apps are not yet integrated. Can I submit a request?

Yes, if you have apps that are not yet integrated with SureTriggers, please submit a request for integration. We offer a wide range of integrations with hundreds of popular apps, plugins and services, and we are always looking for adding more.

### Description

The SureTriggers ‚Äì Connect All Your Plugins, Apps, Tools & Automate Everything! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Trigger Link shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.47 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
