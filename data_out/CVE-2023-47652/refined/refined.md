- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Auto Affiliate Links plugin, in versions up to 6.4.2.4, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, leveraging their existing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is achieved by crafting malicious requests and tricking an authenticated user into executing them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious site or click a crafted link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
