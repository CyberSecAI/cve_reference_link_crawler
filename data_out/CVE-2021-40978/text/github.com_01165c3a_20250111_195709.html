| Hey!  We have verified a security flaw in the current version of MKdocs, a path traversal failure affecting the built-in dev-server.  That flaw turns the server susceptible to providing data outside the scope of the application allowing anyone to request sensitive files.  If you need further information, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40978> <https://github.com/nisdn/CVE-2021-40978> |

| It should be mentioned the dev server is known to not be secure and should not be used in a sensitive environment. The security flaw is using the dev-server in an unsafe way, e.g., as a public server and not just as a development server. |

| Hi [@oprypin](https://github.com/oprypin),  Stumbled upon this issue after using pip-audit; seems this vulnerability was fixed in 1.2.3 ([#2604](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/2604)), but unfortunately it is still listed as active in the PyPA vulnerability advisory-database: <https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/mkdocs/PYSEC-2021-878.yaml>. Is there any way to correct that information?  Cheers! |

| [@LFKoning](https://github.com/LFKoning) thanks for bringing this up. I don't know, your guess is as good as mine. Maybe someone would need to suggest an edit in the repository that you linked? Could you try to search around? |
