| Well, it was reported *after* I opened this issue, and upstream doesn't consider this a real security issue in mkdocs. Please don't request CVEs for invalid bugs, and also please don't request CVEs that haven't been reported to upstream. It really should be a requirement that the issue is reported upstream to request a CVE. |

| Hey!  We have verified a security flaw in the current version of MKdocs, a path traversal failure affecting the built-in dev-server.  That flaw turns the server susceptible to providing data outside the scope of the application allowing anyone to request sensitive files.  If you need further information, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40978> <https://github.com/nisdn/CVE-2021-40978> |

| It should be mentioned the dev server is known to not be secure and should not be used in a sensitive environment. The security flaw is using the dev-server in an unsafe way, e.g., as a public server and not just as a development server. |

| Hi [@oprypin](https://github.com/oprypin),  Stumbled upon this issue after using pip-audit; seems this vulnerability was fixed in 1.2.3 ([#2604](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/2604)), but unfortunately it is still listed as active in the PyPA vulnerability advisory-database: <https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/mkdocs/PYSEC-2021-878.yaml>. Is there any way to correct that information?  Cheers! |

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site
generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation
source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML
configuration file. It is designed to be easy to use and can be extended with
third-party themes, plugins, and Markdown extensions.

Please see the [Documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org) for an introductory tutorial and a full
user guide.

## Features

* Build static HTML files from Markdown files.
* Use Plugins and Markdown Extensions to enhance MkDocs.
* Use the built-in themes, third party themes or create your own.
* Publish your documentation anywhere that static files can be served.
* Much more!
