- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Pootle Pagebuilder WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when users visit the affected site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts can be injected through user input, though the exact method of injection is not detailed in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Contributor level privileges or the ability to input data that is not sanitized.
