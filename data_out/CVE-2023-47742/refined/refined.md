Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two issues:
1. Information exposure through password practices.
2. Man-in-the-middle attacks due to certificate validation issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Weak password practices within the software leading to information exposure.
- Inadequate certificate validation, making the software susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information exposure: Sensitive information (potentially including passwords) may be compromised.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers could intercept and potentially manipulate network traffic between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between a client and the affected IBM software.
- Exploitation of weak password practices that may be present within the system

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to intercept communication between the client and server for MITM attacks.
- Knowledge of/access to the system to take advantage of weak password practices

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Cloud Pak for Security versions 1.10.0.0 through 1.10.11.0
- QRadar Suite Software versions 1.10.12.0 through 1.10.18.0

**Remediation:**
- Upgrade to at least version 1.10.19.0 or later.
