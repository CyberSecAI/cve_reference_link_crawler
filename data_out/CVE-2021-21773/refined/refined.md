The provided content is related to CVE-2021-21773.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing null check for a size field when processing the TIFF header count, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The size of the buffer to be allocated is directly read from the file's TIFF tags (ImageWidth or ImageLength), without proper validation. If the `count` value is manipulated, the allocation size can be very small (1 byte). Subsequently, when initializing an `io_buffer` structure, a write operation happens out of the allocated buffer's bounds, resulting in memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write, caused by an incorrect calculation of buffer size and lack of proper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption, leading to potential code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted, malformed TIFF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF file to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need prior authentication or privileges.
