{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how gRPC handles errors related to metadata limits. Instead of just canceling the specific stream that encountered the error, the system would close the entire transport connection, affecting other potentially unrelated streams.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
       "Incorrect connection management when metadata limits are exceeded"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability occurs because a single stream exceeding metadata limits can lead to the termination of the entire connection, affecting all other streams using the same transport.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a request with excessive metadata to a gRPC server.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the gRPC server."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "gRPC C core library"
  ],
 "fix_details": {
    "fix_description": "The fix ensures that when a stream-related error occurs, only that specific stream is canceled. If the error is not associated with a specific stream, the entire transport is closed. This change prevents unrelated streams from being terminated when a single stream exceeds the metadata limit.",
    "fix_commit": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309"
