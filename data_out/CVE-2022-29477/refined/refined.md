- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the Abode Systems iota All-In-One Security Kit uses a hardcoded HTTP header for authentication to specific `/action/factory` endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Authentication Bypass**:  The application uses a hardcoded value for the `X-Climax-Tag` header to authenticate requests to specific endpoints.
    - **Use of Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798)**: The authentication relies on a fixed, predictable value, instead of a dynamically generated or securely managed credential.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can bypass authentication and access sensitive functionality related to factory testing and configuration, including factory reset.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific `X-Climax-Tag` header to the vulnerable `/action/factory` endpoints of the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
    - The attacker does not need to know existing user credentials.
