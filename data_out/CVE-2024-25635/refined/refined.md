The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25635.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue. The application allows organization owners to access the user details of other organizations by directly manipulating the user ID in the request to `/admin/api/users/<user_id>`. There is a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing one org owner to view the API keys of another org owner.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application uses the user ID directly in the API request without proper validation or authorization, allowing unauthorized access to user details.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The system fails to verify if the user making the request is authorized to view the data for the requested user ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers, specifically organization owners, can access the API keys and user information of other organization owners.
- **Data Access/Modification:** The exposed API keys can be used to access and potentially modify data belonging to other organizations.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
- **Direct API manipulation:** By modifying the user ID in the `/admin/api/users/<user_id>` endpoint, an attacker can access data for users they are not authorized to view.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with an "organization owner" role.
- **Basic knowledge of API manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the user ID parameter in the API request.
