Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It stems from the lack of proper sanitization of document text used in tooltips. Specifically, user-controlled content within a document, when referenced by a field that triggers a tooltip, can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Stored XSS (CWE-79/CWE-80):** Malicious JavaScript is stored within document data and executed when a user interacts with it. This falls into the category of CWE-79, specifically the variant CWE-80, where the vulnerability is the generation of improper output.
    *   **Insufficient input sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the document text content, allowing an attacker to insert malicious code into the document. This malicious code is rendered in the tooltip, executing in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a document. When another user hovers their mouse over the field that references the malicious text, the injected script is executed in the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or forcing downloads of malicious software.
    *   **Defacement of the application:** Modifying the appearance or behavior of the application to cause disruption or misinformation.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Document creation:** The attacker creates a document with malicious XSS code included in the document text.
    *   **Field reference:** The attacker includes a field within the document that references the malicious text.
    *   **Tooltip rendering:** When a victim user hovers their cursor over the field, the application renders a tooltip that includes the malicious XSS, triggering its execution.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create documents within the affected application.
    *   They also need the ability to inject content into document text.
    *   The attacker needs to entice a victim user to open or interact with the malicious document for exploitation.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected versions:** Collabora Online versions prior to 23.05.10.1 are affected.
*   **Patched versions:** The vulnerability is patched in version 23.05.10.1 and later.
*   **Unaffected series:** Older versions like 22.04 and 21.11 are not affected.
