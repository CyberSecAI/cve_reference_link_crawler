- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, the lack of proper checks allows unauthorized access to certain functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could execute higher-privileged actions, leading to potential data breaches, manipulation, or other malicious activities, although the specific impact is case-by-case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the missing authorization or authentication checks, without specific technical details on how the actions are triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user. They do not need any prior access or privileges.
