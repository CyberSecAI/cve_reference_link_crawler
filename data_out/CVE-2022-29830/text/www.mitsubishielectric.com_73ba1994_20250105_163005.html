■Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in multiple Mitsubishi Electric FA engineering software. If these vulnerabilities are exploited by
malicious attackers, disclosure or tampering of the product's information could allow unauthorized users to gain access to the
MELSEC iQ-R/F/L series CPU modules, and MELSEC iQ-R series OPC UA server module, to view and execute programs, or
to view project file illegally. (CVE-2022-25164, CVE-2022-29825, CVE-2022-29826, CVE-2022-29827, CVE-2022-29828,

Mitigations or Workarounds
- Make sure that malicious attackers cannot access project files or security keys that
are stored in your computer/server and configuration files that are stored in your
personal computer running the software, via untrusted network or host

- Install an antivirus software in your personal computer running the software.
-  Encrypt  project  files  and  security  keys  when  sending  or  receiving  them  over  the

Internet.

- Use the "authentication with a certificate" function instead of "username / password
authentication" for user authentication for access from OPC UA clients to MELSEC
iQ-R series OPC UA server modules. (MX OPC UA Module Configurator-R only)
- Make sure that malicious attackers cannot access project files or security keys that
are stored in your computer/server and configuration files that are stored in your
personal computer running the software, via untrusted network or host

- Install an antivirus software in your personal computer running the software.
