The content is related to CVE-2024-41348. It describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities in the openflights project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied data in the `alsearch.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS1 (No permissions required):**  Unsanitized `$_POST["offset"]` and `$_POST["action"]` parameters are used in a database query and later printed in an error message, allowing for reflected XSS.
- **XSS2 (User permissions required):** Unsanitized `$_POST["name"]` parameter is used in a database query and later printed in an error message, allowing for reflected XSS.
- **XSS3 (User permissions required):** Unsanitized `$_POST["alias"]` parameter is used in a database query and later printed in an error message, allowing for reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to:
- Stealing session cookies
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Modifying the content of the web page
- Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious POST request to `alsearch.php` with crafted `offset`, `action`, `name`, and/or `alias` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For XSS1, no login is required, an attacker can directly send a crafted POST request.
- For XSS2 and XSS3, an attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the web application.
