### @skitt **[skitt](/skitt)** commented [Nov 28, 2022](#issue-1467025130)

The udev rules currently make supported device nodes world-readable and writable, which means that any process on the system can read traffic from keyboards including passwords etc. To avoid this, while still allowing the "controlling" user to run g810-led without being root, this patch adds a uaccess tag; this ensures that the user at the console has write access to the devices. The mode is also changed to 660 to ensure that existing device nodes are fixed on upgrade.

Thanks to Xavi Drudis Ferran for bringing this to my attention.

Fixes: [#293](https://github.com/MatMoul/g810-led/issues/293)
