The provided content is related to CVE-2023-32604.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by user input validation and sanitization issues within Trend Micro Apex Central (on-premise). This lack of proper sanitization allows for reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Authenticated Reflected XSS Vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or information disclosure. However, the impact is limited to Confidentiality(low), Integrity(low) and No availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to inject malicious code into an input field, which is then reflected back to the user's browser, where it executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must first obtain valid credentials to authenticate to the Trend Micro Apex Central system to exploit the vulnerability.
