- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `decodePwd` function copies data from the `adslPwd` parameter without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `decodePwd` function. The size of the buffer `v15` is not checked against the length of the `adslPwd` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WanParameterSetting` endpoint with a large `adslPwd` parameter when `wanType` is 2 and `connect` is set to 1.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
