# Management endpoints vulnerable to drive-by localhost attack

Moderate

[mattmoss](/mattmoss)
published
GHSA-583g-g682-crxf
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

management
(Micronaut)

## Affected versions

< 3.8.3

## Patched versions

3.8.3

## Description

### Summary

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought.

### Details

A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are ["simple"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered.

### Impact

Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
