The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Membership Management System (MMS) in PHP, specifically within the `add_members.php` file.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user input in the `fullname` field within the `add_members.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored on the server. When other users view the affected member's details, this code will execute in their browser's context. This allows the attacker to potentially steal session cookies or perform other malicious actions. The specific example shows an attacker able to execute Javascript to read user cookies.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a POST request to the `add_members.php` page. The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript payload in the `fullname` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests to the `add_members.php` endpoint, which suggests that they must be logged in or have access to the system's functionality.
