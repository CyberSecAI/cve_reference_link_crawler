Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `index.php` file of the "Simple Online Hotel Reservation System in PHP Project With Source Code".
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `username` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability
- Insufficient user input validation
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering and modification.
- Potential for system control and service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `username` parameter of a POST request to the `index.php` file.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `username` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any login or authorization to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable application with crafted username parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) payloads demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by N3xu5Cr4ck37.
- The vulnerable software is version 1.0 of "Simple Online Hotel Reservation System in PHP Project With Source Code".
- The provided SQLMap command demonstrates how to use SQLMap to exploit the SQL injection.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by using the following parameter `username` in the POST request:
    ```
    username=Admin' AND 8568=8568-- pQTp&password=admin&login=
    username=Admin' AND (SELECT 1873 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))PTDi)-- qlML&password=admin&login=
    ```
- The application is vulnerable even if the attacker does not have credentials because the vulnerable parameter is used in the login query which is not sanitized.
