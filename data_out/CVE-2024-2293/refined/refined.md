{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the user display name.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when other users access pages containing the injected content. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of a user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The user display name field, which is used in the Site Reviews plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions in WordPress. They do not need any special administrative privileges."
