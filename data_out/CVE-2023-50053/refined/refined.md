The provided content relates to CVE-2023-50053.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of a nonce in the signed message used for Web3 authentication on the Foundation.app platform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of a nonce in the message signed by the user's crypto wallet during authentication. This makes the system vulnerable to replay attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** By replaying a previously obtained valid signature, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's account on the Foundation.app platform.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a replay attack, where an attacker intercepts or obtains a valid signature from a legitimate user and reuses it to authenticate as that user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or otherwise obtain a valid signature from a legitimate user. They do not need to be on the same network, as the signature can be replayed remotely.
