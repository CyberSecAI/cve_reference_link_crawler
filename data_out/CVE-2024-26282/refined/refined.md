Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for iOS handles the `<link rel="canonical">` tag within AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) URLs. When a URL starts with `/amp`, the browser incorrectly uses the URL specified in the `<link rel="canonical">` tag as the current page's URL. Additionally, when bookmarking the page, the canonical URL is used instead of the actual URL. Crucially, the browser doesn't validate the scheme of the canonical URL, allowing for `javascript:` URLs to be used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect URL Handling:** Firefox for iOS incorrectly prioritizes the canonical URL over the actual URL when the page is an AMP page.
*   **Lack of Scheme Validation:** The browser does not validate the scheme of the provided canonical URL, allowing for execution of Javascript code through the `javascript:` scheme.
*   **Bookmark Manipulation:** The bookmark feature uses the potentially malicious canonical URL instead of the actual URL, which can lead to code execution upon bookmark retrieval.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UXSS (Universal Cross-Site Scripting):** By crafting a malicious AMP page with a `javascript:` URL in the `<link rel="canonical">` tag, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of any site the victim visits after opening the malicious bookmark.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious AMP Page:** The attacker creates a malicious AMP page that includes a `<link rel="canonical">` tag with a `javascript:` URL.
2.  **Victim Browses to Malicious Page:** The victim visits the attacker's crafted AMP page in Firefox for iOS.
3.  **Victim Bookmarks Page:**  The victim bookmarks the page. Due to the vulnerability, the bookmark saves the `javascript:` URL.
4.  **Victim Opens Bookmark:** The victim opens the bookmark, causing the stored `javascript:` URL to be executed within the context of the currently opened site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker needs to host a malicious AMP page on a server they control.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to visit the malicious AMP page and bookmark it.
*   **No specific network position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially classified as a privilege escalation but was later downgraded to a same-origin policy (SOP) violation due to the need for user interaction (bookmarking and opening the bookmark).
*   The fix involved validating the scheme of the canonical URL to only allow `http` and `https` URLs.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox for iOS version 123.
* The bug report also includes a video demonstration of the exploit, a github pull request and a security advisory.
