Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `nestjs-proxy` library, in versions prior to the patched versions, lacked a mechanism to prevent sensitive cookies from being forwarded to backend services. This was due to a design flaw where all cookies were forwarded by default, leading to potential unintended disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive cookies (like session cookies) to backend services that should not have access to them. This could allow an attacker to gain access to a user's session, impersonating the user.
- **Lack of Default Security:** The library's default behavior of forwarding all cookies made it inherently insecure, as it required explicit action from the application developer to prevent sensitive cookie exposure, rather than being secure by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of session cookies would allow an attacker to impersonate a user, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or actions available to that user.
- **Integrity Breach:** With access to a user's session, an attacker might be able to modify data, which would be treated as if the actual user made those modifications.
- **Potential Data Loss:** Depending on the application's functionality, an attacker may delete data with the compromised session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Level:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the network traffic where the cookies are being forwarded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires a local attack vector, according to the CVSS score. While it doesn't necessarily mean physical access, the attacker would need to be positioned to intercept or control requests within the application environment (e.g. server or container).
- **Application Configuration:** The vulnerability is exploitable if the application using the vulnerable library is configured to forward requests to backend services.
- **High Privileges Required:** The CVSS score specifies that the attack requires high privileges. This suggests that the attacker must have control over the environment where the vulnerable application runs.
- **User Interaction Required:** The CVSS score indicates that user interaction is required. This implies the attacker needs the application user to initiate the request.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is addressed by:
- The library now blocks all cookies from being forwarded by default.
- Developers can configure an allow-list of specific cookies to be forwarded using the `allowedCookies` configuration setting.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `@ffdc/nestjs-proxy` package is deprecated. Users are advised to migrate to `@finastra/nestjs-proxy` version 0.7.0 or later.
- The fix was introduced in pull request #232.
- The severity is rated as moderate with a CVSS score of 5.8.

**Summary of Changes made in PR #232:**
- Added an option to opt out from token forwarding per service.
- Added unit tests for the changes.
- Implemented the feature to allow specific cookies via `allowedCookies` configuration.
- Fixed a typo in the documentation.
