- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `formWsc` function of the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK's `boa` web server due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `targetAPMac` parameter from an HTTP request.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to lack of input sanitization. The `targetAPMac` parameter is copied into the `targetAPMacFilter` buffer without checking the size of the input.

- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can achieve remote code execution by overflowing the `targetAPMacFilter` buffer on the stack with malicious code. This allows the attacker to take control of the vulnerable device.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a series of specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/boafrm/formWsc` API.  The attacker must first access the `/wlwps.htm` page. The crafted POST request includes the parameters `triggerPIN` (set to 1) and `targetAPMac`, where the latter contains a string of hexadecimal characters longer than the `targetAPMacFilter` buffer can hold.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.  Additionally, the attacker needs valid credentials (default is `admin:admin`) to access the web interface, or bypass the CSRF protection by first loading the `/wlwps.htm` page. The WPS functionality must be enabled on the target device for the vulnerable code to be reached.
