The provided content is related to CVE-2021-46519.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `mjs_array_length` function within the `src/mjs_array.c` file. The overflow happens when the program attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer for the array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a crash due to an attempt to read from an invalid memory address.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted JavaScript program (poc.js) which exploits a specific behavior of the mjs engine when handling arrays and object creation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted JavaScript file using the mjs engine. This would mean they need to have the ability to provide an input file to the mjs binary.
