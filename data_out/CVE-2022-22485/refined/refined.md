- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Protect Server, in certain instances, may not increment the number of invalid sign-on attempts from Operations Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of failed login attempts, specifically the failure to increment the counter for invalid sign-on attempts from the Operations Center.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could use brute force techniques to gain access to the IBM Spectrum Protect Server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the Operations Center interface by repeatedly attempting to log in with invalid credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the IBM Spectrum Protect Server and must be able to target the Operations Center login interface.
