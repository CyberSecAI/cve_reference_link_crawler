The provided content is related to CVE-2024-26064.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L) and low privileges (PR:L). User interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges on the system and needs to convince a user to interact with the crafted malicious code. The scope is changed (S:C) in the CVSS vector, meaning the vulnerability will cause the attacker to gain access to resources outside of their own control.
