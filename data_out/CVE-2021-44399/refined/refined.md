- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` application incorrectly handles non-object JSON values passed to the `param` field, leading to an assertion failure due to an incorrect type check in the JSON parsing library when attempting to use the subscription operator on a non-object type, which then results in the process crashing.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. Specifically, the code assumes the "param" field will always contain a JSON object, but it doesn't validate this assumption, leading to a type error.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit results in the `cgiserver.cgi` process crashing which will cause the device to reboot, resulting in denial of service.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST request containing a JSON body where the `param` field is not a JSON object, but a string or other non-object type.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send HTTP requests. While most of these vulnerabilities require an authenticated user, itâ€™s noted that TALOS-2021-1420 can be used to perform these API calls without authentication.
