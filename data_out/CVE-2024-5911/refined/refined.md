- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An arbitrary file upload vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Panorama software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload (CWE-434) that allows uploading files with dangerous types.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated read-write administrator can upload arbitrary files, leading to disruption of system processes, crashing the Panorama system, and eventually causing it to enter maintenance mode. This requires manual intervention to restore the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the Panorama web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated read-write administrator with access to the web interface.
