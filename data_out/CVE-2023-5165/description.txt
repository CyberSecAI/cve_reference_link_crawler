Docker Desktop before 4.23.0 allows an unprivileged user to bypass Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) restrictions via the debug shell which remains accessible for a short time window after launching Docker Desktop. The affected functionality is available for Docker Business customers only and assumes an environment where users are not granted local root or Administrator privileges. 

This issue has been fixed in Docker Desktop 4.23.0. 

Affected Docker Desktop versions: from 4.13.0 before 4.23.0.
