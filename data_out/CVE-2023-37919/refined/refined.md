- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate existing sessions upon enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Inadequate session management when 2FA is enabled. Specifically, the application does not terminate active sessions on other devices when 2FA is activated on one device.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker with an active session on a separate device can maintain access even after the legitimate user enables 2FA, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the account and its data.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through maintaining an active session on a different device while the legitimate user enables 2FA on another device.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have an active session on a separate device for the same account.
