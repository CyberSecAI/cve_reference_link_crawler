Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6526

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when displaying custom post meta values through the plugin's shortcode `[rwmb_meta]`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input (custom post meta values) before displaying it on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed in the victim's browser when the affected page is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user inserts a shortcode `[rwmb_meta]` and the meta value is displayed without proper escaping
- An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts through custom post meta values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to create or edit posts:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts and add custom meta values.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Meta Box plugin up to and including 5.9.2.
- The fix was released in version 5.9.3, which includes output escaping for the `[rwmb_meta]` shortcode.
- Users who wish to revert to the previous behaviour (no escaping) can use the `rwmb_meta_shortcode_secure` or `rwmb_meta_shortcode_secure_{$field_id}` filters, setting them to return `false`.

This vulnerability allows for Stored XSS, meaning the malicious code is stored in the database and executed every time a user visits the page containing the shortcode with the malicious meta value. The provided information gives more context than the placeholder CVE description.
