- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of attributes in the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) and G-IKEv2 protocols of the GET VPN feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution or device crash leading to a denial of service (DoS)
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Compromising an existing key server and modifying GDOI or G-IKEv2 packets sent to group members.
    - Building a new malicious key server and reconfiguring a group member to communicate with it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated administrative access to a group member to reconfigure the key server
    - Control of a compromised or malicious key server that can communicate with the group member, including possessing the correct PSK and policies, and the ability to modify GDOI or G-IKEv2 packets.
