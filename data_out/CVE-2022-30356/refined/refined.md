Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30356

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation in the `/user/assignuserrole` endpoint, which allows an attacker with `OE_ADMIN` privileges to arbitrarily assign any role to any user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Role Assignment:** The application fails to properly validate the requested role assignment, allowing an `OE_ADMIN` user to elevate the privileges of any other user by assigning them any defined role, such as `OE_SENSITIVE_ADMIN`.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The `assignuserrole` endpoint lacks proper access controls, allowing the `OE_ADMIN` role to perform unrestricted privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with `OE_ADMIN` privileges can escalate the privileges of any user within the system, potentially granting them access to sensitive data or administrative functionalities they were not intended to have. This can lead to complete control of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a POST request to the `/user/assignuserrole` endpoint.
*   **Form-encoded Data:** The request parameters (`userid`, `role`, and `action`) are sent as form-encoded data in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication as OE_ADMIN:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user with the `OE_ADMIN` role.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `/user/assignuserrole`
*   **HTTP Method:** POST
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:**  `role` parameter in the request body
*   **Request Body Example:** `userid=admin&role=OE_SENSITIVE_ADMIN&action=ADD`
*   **Affected Versions:** OvalEdge 5.2.8.0 and earlier
