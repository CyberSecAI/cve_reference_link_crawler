Package        : libapache-mod-jk
Version        : 1:1.2.46-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-41081
Debian Bug     : 1051956

The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors, an Apache 2 module to
forward requests from Apache to Tomcat, in some circumstances, such as when
a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the
configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied
requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to the
first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the
unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints
configured in httpd. As of this security update, the implicit mapping
functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit
configuration. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only).

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.2.46-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.
