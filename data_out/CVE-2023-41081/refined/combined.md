Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk)
 Information Disclosure

CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat Connectors mod_jk Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.48

Description:
In some circumstances, such as when a configuration included
"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the configuration did not provide
explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would use an
implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such
an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the
status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As
of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and
all mappings must now be via explicit configuration.
Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat Connector (mod_jk) 1.2.49 or later.
- Ensure explicit mounts are configured for all possible proxied
   requests

Credit:
This vulnerability was reported responsibly to the Tomcat security team
by Karl von Randow.

Package        : libapache-mod-jk
Version        : 1:1.2.46-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-41081
Debian Bug     : 1051956

The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors, an Apache 2 module to
forward requests from Apache to Tomcat, in some circumstances, such as when
a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the
configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied
requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to the
first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the
unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints
configured in httpd. As of this security update, the implicit mapping
functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit
configuration. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only).

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.2.46-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.

For the detailed security status of libapache-mod-jk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache-mod-jk>

Subject: CVE-2023-41081: Apache Tomcat Connectors: Unexpected use of first
 declared worker in mod_jk for unmapped request [CORRECTION]

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.0 through 1.2.48

Description:

Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081

The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances,
such as when a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories"
but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all
possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping
and map the request to the first defined worker. Such an implicit
mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker
and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49,
the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings
must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this
issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0
through 1.2.48.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.
