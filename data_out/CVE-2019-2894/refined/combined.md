Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in denial of
service, sandbox bypass, information disclosure or the execution
of arbitrary code.

Updates for the amd64 architecture are already available, new packages
for i386, armel and armhf will be available within the next 24 hours.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
7u241-2.6.20-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.

## Details

Jan Jancar, Petr Svenda, and Vladimir Sedlacek discovered that a side-

channel vulnerability existed in the ECDSA implementation in OpenJDK. An

Attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-2894](/security/CVE-2019-2894))

It was discovered that the Socket implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly restrict the creation of subclasses with a custom Socket

implementation. An attacker could use this to specially create a Java class

that could possibly bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2019-2945](/security/CVE-2019-2945))

Rob Hamm discovered that the Kerberos implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly handle proxy credentials. An attacker could possibly use this to

impersonate another user. ([CVE-2019-2949](/security/CVE-2019-2949))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the font

handling implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2962](/security/CVE-2019-2962))

It was discovered that the Concurrency subsystem in OpenJDK did not

properly bound stack consumption when compiling regular expressions. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2964](/security/CVE-2019-2964))

It was discovered that the JAXP subsystem in OpenJDK did not properly

handle XPath expressions in some situations. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2973](/security/CVE-2019-2973),

[CVE-2019-2981](/security/CVE-2019-2981))

It was discovered that the Nashorn JavaScript subcomponent in OpenJDK did

not properly handle regular expressions in some situations. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2975](/security/CVE-2019-2975))

It was discovered that the String class in OpenJDK contained an out-of-

bounds access vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.

This issue only affected OpenJDK 11 in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 19.04,

and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-2977](/security/CVE-2019-2977))

It was discovered that the Jar URL handler in OpenJDK did not properly

handled nested Jar URLs in some situations. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2978](/security/CVE-2019-2978))

It was discovered that the Serialization component of OpenJDK did not

properly handle deserialization of certain object attributes. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash).

([CVE-2019-2983](/security/CVE-2019-2983))

It was discovered that the FreetypeFontScaler class in OpenJDK did not

properly validate dimensions of glyph bitmap images read from font files.

An attacker could specially craft a font file that could cause a denial of

service (application crash). ([CVE-2019-2987](/security/CVE-2019-2987))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the SunGraphics2D class

in OpenJDK. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (excessive memory consumption or application crash).

([CVE-2019-2988](/security/CVE-2019-2988))

It was discovered that the Networking component in OpenJDK did not properly

handle certain responses from HTTP proxies. An attacker controlling a

malicious HTTP proxy could possibly use this to inject content into a

proxied HTTP connection. ([CVE-2019-2989](/security/CVE-2019-2989))

It was discovered that the font handling implementation in OpenJDK did not

properly validate TrueType font files in some situations. An attacker could

specially craft a font file that could cause a denial of service (excessive

memory consumption). ([CVE-2019-2992](/security/CVE-2019-2992))

It was discovered that the JavaDoc generator in OpenJDK did not properly

filter out some HTML elements properly, including documentation comments in

Java source code. An attacker could possibly use this to craft a Cross-Site

Scripting attack. ([CVE-2019-2999](/security/CVE-2019-2999))

Subject: Minerva: ECDSA key recovery from bit-length leakage

*Webpage*
=========

<https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/>

*Vulnerability*
===============

Minerva is a group of vulnerabilities in ECDSA/EdDSA implementations that allows
for practical recovery of the long-term private key.

We have found implementations which leak the bit-length of the scalar during
scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve. This leakage might seem minuscule as
the bit-length presents a very small amount of information present in the
scalar. However, in the case of ECDSA/EdDSA signature generation, the leaked
bit-length of the random nonce is enough for full recovery of the private key
used after observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures on known
messages, due to the application of lattice techniques.

<https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/>

 * Cards
   - Athena IDProtect
 * Libraries
   - libgcrypt upto 1.8.4, fixed in 1.8.5

[![CRoCS logo](assets/img/crocs.svg)](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz "Visit the CRoCS website")

This page describes our discovery of a group of side-channel vulnerabilities in implementations of
ECDSA
in programmable smart cards and cryptographic software libraries. Our attack allows for practical
recovery of the long-term private key. We have found implementations which leak
the bit-length of the scalar during scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve. This leakage might seem minuscule
as the bit-length presents a very small amount of information present in the scalar. However, in the case of
ECDSA signature generation, the leaked bit-length of the random
nonce is enough for full recovery of the private key used after observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures
on known messages, due to the application of lattice techniques.

We have verified our attack against
an Athena IDProtect card, running on an Inside Secure AT90SC chip,
for more affected devices see the [next section](#affected). The attack required 2100
signatures to recover the private key on the standard secp256r1 curve, using an off-the-shelf
smart card reader, running on an ordinary Linux laptop with a runtime of a few minutes after the collection of
signatures. The total time for the attack, including the collection of signatures was around 30 minutes.

We propose two new methods to recover the full private key
requiring just 500 signatures for simulated leakage data, 1200 for real cryptographic
library data, and 2100 for smartcard data. Our attack and proof-of-concept code is inspired by the method of [Brumley & Tuveri [3]](#remote),
for more details, see the [section](#details) on the attack.

The paper, containing our improvements and systematic analysis of lattice attacks on ECDSA appeared at CHES 2020.
The paper also received the Best Paper Award at CHES 2020! ![](assets/img/tada.png)

**Primary contact:** Jan Jancar ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT

**Update** Added a [list](#secure-impl) of libraries and cards tested and deemed not vulnerable.

**Update** This page originally claimed an attack also applicable to EdDSA, due to the leakage
also being present in the EdDSA implementation in libgcrypt. However, an attack path for
EdDSA is not clear, as the leakage does not represent the bit-length of the random nonce modulo the curve order,
but a full SHA-512 bit hash. Without the implementation reducing this modulo the curve order (which is not required by the protocol),
the leakage does not seem to be exploitable. We have thus removed EdDSA mentions from this page.

### Affected devices and libraries

We have tested our attack on an Athena IDProtect card with CPLC data `010b.0352.0005`.
We further believe the following devices and cryptographic libraries to be affected:

    **Update**: The EdDSA scalar multiplication code in libgcrypt was leaking, however due to the way it was used, it was likely not exploitable.
    It did not reduce the scalar which was a SHA512 digest by the curve order, but used the digest directly, thus the leakage did not represent the bit-length of the reduced scalar.
    Thanks to Daniel J. Bernstein for the note.

We believe all of the cards above are affected because they share a common ECDSA component (FIPS
module
[214](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/details?source=ECDSA&number=214))
, which is described as Athena OS755 ECDSA2 Component on
Inside Secure AT90SC A1.0 (Firmware). We have tested the vulnerability only on the Athena IDProtect card with CPLC data
`010b.0352.0005` and ATR
`3bd518ff8191fe1fc38073c8211309`.

We believe that the source of the vulnerability of the aforementioned cards utilizing the Athena ECDSA component is
the Atmel Toolbox 00.03.11.05 with the Common Criteria certificate DCSSI-CC-2009/11
([security target](https://commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/dcssi-cible2009_11en.pdf),
[certification report](https://commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/dcssi-2009_11fr.pdf), [info page](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/certification_cc/bibliotheque-cryptographique-atmel-toolbox-00-03-11-05/)).
The security target states the following under security functions (on pages 48 and 49):

```

- M10.6 the TSF shall provide digital signature confirming to EC-DSA standard.
    - Secure digital signature generate
    - Secure digital signature verify
    - Fast digital signature generate (see note*)
    - Fast digital signature verify (see note*)

- M10.7 the TSF shall provide point multiplication on an elliptical curve, conforming to EC-DSA standard.
    - Secure multiply
    - Fast multiply (see note*)

    * The Fast functions of M10.3, M10.4, M10.5, M10.7, M10.8, M10.9, do not
    offer any DPA/SPA protection and must not be used for secure data.
```

We assume that the vulnerable Athena cards used the fast and insecure functions. Our hypothesis was confirmed to us after discussions
with the vendor, see more in the [responsible disclosure](#disclosure) section.

### Tested implementations deemed secure

Most implementations we analyzed during this research did not show any leakage and are thus likely secure.
We cannot be sure of this, as our tests might not be exhaustive due to the complexity of the implementations.

The libraries usually have multiple scalar multiplication algorithms and choose from them based on build options, runtime configuration,
curve used, cryptosystem used and operation being performed. Thus, our testing might just not have caught a particular configuration that could still
be vulnerable. Below, we list libraries we tested and found not vulnerable:

#### Libraries

* OpenSSL 1.1.1d
* BouncyCastle 1.58
* BoringSSL 974f4dddf
* libtomcrypt 1.18.2
* Botan 2.11.0
* Microsoft CNG
* mbedTLS 2.16.0
* Intel IPP-Crypto
* IAIK ECCelerate 6.0.1

#### Cards

* ACS ACOSJ 40K
* Feitian A22CR
* G&D SmartCafe 6.0
* G&D SmartCafe 7.0
* Infineon CJTOP 80K INF SLJ 52GLA080AL M8.4
* Infineon SLE78 Universal JCard

### Questions & Answers

* **Is my device affected?**

  See the section on [affected devices](#affected),
  also if you have access to an unlocked JavaCard, you can test its
  vulnerability using our [proof-of-concept](#poc) and other testing tools.
  If you found a device or a library that is affected but is not present in the list above,
  please contact us.
* **Is my library affected?**

  See the section on [affected devices](#affected),
  if it is not there and it is supported by the
  [ECTester](https://crocs-muni.github.io/ECTester/) tool
  then it is probably not affected, as we tested it ([list
  of supported libraries](https://github.com/crocs-muni/ECTester/blob/master/docs/LIBS.md)). If it is not supported, we did not check.
  Furthermore, even if it is listed and we have tested it, it still may be vulnerable as
  cryptographic libraries often
  contain more than one scalar multiplication algorithm implementation, which can be enabled
  either by build options or
  sometimes even at runtime, where different algorithms are used for different classes of curves.
  We have usually tested the libraries
  in only one configuration and on a few curves (secp256r1, sect233r1...).
* **Are other devices running on the AT90SC chip affected?**

  The AT90SC chip was sold along with the Atmel Toolbox, a cryptographic toolbox
  utilizing the functionality of the Ad-X cryptographic coprocessor to provide some higher/level cryptographic
  functionality, such as ECDSA or RSA. This toolbox evolved, as the underlying intellectual property was
  sold from Atmel to Inside Secure (now called Verimatrix) and finally to WiseKey. The vulnerability is
  known to be present in one concrete version of the toolbox, the
  Atmel Toolbox 00.03.11.05 on the AT90SC Family of Devices, as specified in the
  Common Criteria [security target](https://commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/dcssi-cible2009_11en.pdf) of the toolbox.
  This version of the toolbox contains two versions of ECDSA functionality, secure and fast, the device
  using the toolbox is affected if it uses the fast version of the primitive, as the above-specified cards do.
  We do not know if other versions of this toolbox, and the renamed INSIDE Toolbox or
  WiseKey Toolbox contain the insecure functionality or if they are vulnerable.
* **Why did the Atmel Toolbox contain explicitly insecure functionality?**

  We have no idea. Having functions that perform signing or encryption, but are explicitly marked as insecure is possibly faster but also pointless and dangerous as can be seen from the resulting vulnerabilities.
* **Is there a proof of concept?**

  Yes, see the [next section](#poc).
* **Are there any CVEs for Minerva?**

  Yes, the following:
  + [CVE-2019-15809](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15809):
    Vulnerability in Athena-based cards.
  + [CVE-2019-13627](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13627):
    Vulnerability in libgcrypt.
  + [CVE-2019-13628](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13628):
    Vulnerability in wolfSSL/wolfCrypt.
  + [CVE-2019-13629](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13629):
    Vulnerability in MatrixSSL.
  + [CVE-2019-2894](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-2894):
    Vulnerability in SunEC/OpenJDK/Oracle JDK.
  + [CVE-2019-14318](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14318):
    Vulnerability in Crypto++.
* **What is required to perform the attack?**

  The attacker needs to be able to measure the duration of hundreds to thousands of signing operations
  of known messages. The less noise in the measurement is present, the less signatures the attacker needs.
  The computation of the private key is then a matter of seconds or minutes.
* **Is this exploitable locally?**

  Definitely, if the runtime of signing operations performed by an affected device or library is measurable,
  locally the amount of noise is not enough to stop the attack. We have verified this against the affected libraries,
  and the code to do so is present in the [PoC](#poc).
* **Is this exploitable remotely?**

  Maybe, [Brumley & Tuveri [3]](#remote) demonstrate the attack using the loopback interface of the same machine
  and even between two machines sharing the same network switch. We think this could be extended by collection of a larger amount
  of signatures and an increase in computation time.

  Furthermore, the [TPM-Fail [14]](#tpm-fail) paper demonstrates the attack using two machines sharing the same network switch.
  We do not consider this really remote though, as the noise introduced by such a switch can be even smaller than noise naturally present in
  a leaking but noisy implementation, such as a smartcard.
* **I own a vulnerable device, can I fix it?**

  Probably not, the vulnerability is present in the underlying firmware, which is
  inaccessible to the user/administrator of the device. However, the firmware might be updateable by the
  manufacturer. In the case of a vulnerable library, updating it to the newest version should fix it, as most libraries we notified
  fixed the issue and released a new version.
* **How did this happen? The devices are certified.**

  The FIPS 140-2 certification scheme specifically does not require side-channel resistance to be tested by
  the lab performing the assessment (see [[12]](#fips) page 12 on *Mitigation of other attacks*). So even though the FIPS security targets of the aforementioned cards specify
  resistance against side-channel attacks, no such testing had to be performed. The case of Common Criteria certificate
  [ANSSI-CC-2012/23](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/certification_cc/athena-os755idprotect-v6-sscd/) can be answered
  easily as well, the ECDSA functionality of the card is explicitly mentioned to be out of the security requirements.
  The original Common Criteria certificate DCSSI-CC-2009/11 that introduced the vulnerable functionality did so by
  stating the functionality is explicitly not protected against SPA/DPA attacks and should not be used on secure data.

  As for the libraries, preventing leakage of the bit-length is surprisingly hard as we analyzed in the section on [root causes](#details-reasons).
* **Why is it called Minerva?**

  We discovered this vulnerability on cards from the Athena SCS manufacturer,
  which was named after the greek goddess
  [Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena "Wikipedia:Athena").
  [Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva "Wikipedia:Minerva")
  is the Roman equivalent.
* **Why the logo?**

  Why not? An owl was one of the main symbols of the Roman goddess Minerva. You can download it
  [here](assets/img/logo.svg) in svg (or [here](assets/img/logo.png) in png), it is [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licensed.

#### Proof-of-Concept

The Minerva proof-of-concept contains code that exploits the vulnerability against a JavaCard with a target applet,
or against targets using several vulnerable libraries.

##### Contents

`applet/` contains code of the two target JavaCard applets, the `CollectApplet` and the `POCApplet`.
The applets are very similar, the only difference is that the `POCApplet` will never export its private key, so it can
be used for full verification of the attack (if the private key is recovered and the device never exported it). It generates an ECC keypair on the
`secp256r1` curve in the `PREPARE` command and exports the public key in the response as well as the data
that will be signed. Then, in the `SIGN` command it signs the data using ECDSA with SHA256 and responds
with the signature. See `build.xml` for the ant build script.

`attack/` contains two attack scripts. An online one against a JavaCard target in `poc.py` and
an offline one in `attack.py`. Both are written in Python 3 and use the
`pyscard` library for communication and `fpylll` library for lattice reduction
and CVP solving required for the attack. Both take parameters in the form of a JSON
file, which specified what kind of attack is to be performed, see the description in `attack.py`.
The offline attack takes as input a csv file produced by one of the targets or the collection
script in `collect/` for the target JavaCard applet. The `params.json` file can
be used as a template to change some parameters internal to the attack or the PoC.

`build/` is a directory created by the ant build which contains the CAP file with the
built JavaCard applet.

`collect/` contains a Python script which collects signatures from the target JavaCard applet
and outputs it in a format ready for the offline attack script `attack/attack.py`.

`ext/` contains some third party content, such as the ant-javacard extension
(`ant-javacard.jar`) for the ant build system, which is used to build the
applet as well as a version of the JavaCard SDK 2.2.2 (`jckit_222`).

`target/` contains target apps which perform ECDSA signatures using the vulnerable libraries
and export the signatures with timing information in format ready for the offline attack script
`attack/attack.py`. See the Makefile for information on building.

##### Usage with JavaCard (PoC)

1. Build the applet via `ant build`.
2. Install the applet (`build/poc_applet.cap`) on the card. For example
   using [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro), so
   doing `gp --install build/poc_applet.cap`.
3. Install Python packages from `requirements.txt` (into a virtualenv).
   Starting with `pip install Cython` first, as it is a build dependency of
   `fpylll`. `fpylll` has a somewhat more involved install process, see
   <https://github.com/fplll/fpylll>,
   you will need the current master version of `fpylll`.
4. Run `./attack/poc.py`. If a USB reader is used, not using other
   USB devices during the attack makes it more reliable. Also, not using the machine
   for other computations during the attack limits the noise and makes it more reliable.
5. Observe a new keypair being generated (the public key is exported from
   the card and printed) and the attack starting. Observe the reconstructed
   private key after around 10k-25k signatures. If the attack did not succeed
   after this time, it is likely that that particular run of the attack will
   not succeed at all, likely due to noise during the timing measurement.

##### Usage with JavaCard (Collect)

1. Build the applet via `ant build`.
2. Install the applet (`build/collect_applet.cap`) on the card. For example
   using [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro), so
   doing `gp --install build/collect_applet.cap`.
3. Install Python packages from `requirements.txt` (into a virtualenv).
   Starting with `pip install Cython` first, as it is a build dependency of
   `fpylll`. `fpylll` has a somewhat more involved install process, see
   <https://github.com/fplll/fpylll>,
   you will need the current master version of `fpylll`.
4. Run `./attack/collect.py`. If a USB reader is used, not using other
   USB devices during the attack makes it more reliable. Also, not using the machine
   for other computations during the attack limits the noise and makes it more reliable.
5. Observe a new keypair being generated and signatures being performed
   (the public key is exported from the card and printed, the private key is also exported in this mode).
   Save the output of the `collect.py` script somewhere, it is in csv.
6. Run `./attack/attack.py` passing the arguments `secp256r1 sha256` and a path to the collected file.
   Observe the reconstructed private key.

##### Usage with libraries

1. Build the particular target app using the Makefile in the `target/` directory.
2. Run the target, possibly with [frequency scaling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling "CPU frequency scaling") off,
   passing the arguments: the chosen curve, hash algorithm and amount of signatures requested. Save the
   output to a file.
3. Install Python packages from `requirements.txt` (into a virtualenv).
   Starting with `pip install Cython` first, as it is a build dependency of
   `fpylll`. `fpylll` has a somewhat more involved install process, see
   <https://github.com/fplll/fpylll>,
   you will need the current master version of `fpylll`.
4. Run `./attack/attack.py`, again passing the arguments: chosen curve, hash algorithm and filename
   containing the signatures from the target. Observe the reconstructed private key.

##### Usage with simulated data

1. Run `./attack/simulate.py <curve> <hash> <count>` with optional parameters specifying the
   leakage properties of the simulated target (`base`, `iter-time` and `sdev`) as modelled in the paper.
2. Run `./attack/attack.py`, again passing the arguments: chosen curve, hash algorithm and filename containing the signatures from the target.
   Observe the reconstructed private key.

#### CPLC checker

The Minerva CPLC checker uses the Card Production Life Cycle (CPLC) data present on
cards under the GlobalPlatform standard to identify vulnerable cards based on a list of
known or suspected vulnerable devices.

To run this tool, install the Python requirements from the `requirements.txt` file,
then simply insert the tested card into your reader and run the `./check.py` script.

#### ECDH tester

The Minerva tester is a testing tool for JavaCards which uses ECDH to assess the presence
of timing leakage of bit-length in scalar-multiplication. Since it has to use ECDH to control
the scalar (the ECDSA API in JavaCard does not allow to choose the random nonce = the scalar) the presence
of leakage in ECDH cannot be used to prove the presence of leakage in ECDSA, as the two might
be implemented differently and have different side-channel protections. We have observed both
cards which leaked in ECDH but not in ECDSA and those that leaked in ECDH and ECDSA.

##### Contents

`applet/` contains code of a target applet. The applet creates an ECC keypair and sets the `secp256r1`
curve parameters. In the `PREPARE` command, the applet prepares a private key for ECDH, with bit-length
set in the command, the private key simply has the form `1 << (bit_length - 1)`. In the `KEX` command
the applet performs ECDH with the prepared private key. See `build.xml` for the ant build script.

`build/` is a directory created by the ant build which contains the CAP file with the
built JavaCard applet.

`reader/` contains code of the tester. It is written in Python 3 and uses the
`pyscard` library for communication.

`ext/` contains some third party content, such as the ant-javacard extension
(`ant-javacard.jar`) for the ant build system, which is used to build the
applet as well as a version of the JavaCard SDK 2.2.2 (`jckit_222`).

##### Usage

1. Build the applet via `ant build`.
2. Install the applet (`build/applet.cap`) on the card. For example
   using [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro), so
   doing `gp --install build/applet.cap`.
3. Install Python packages from `requirements.txt` (into a virtualenv).
4. Run `./reader/test.py`.
5. Observe ECDH being performed, with private keys of varying bit-length, after
   all of the measurements are done a plot will display, showing the dependency
   of ECDH duration on bit-length (if any), and the correlation of the two. This
   dependency cannot be directly connected to ECDSA, since a different algorithm
   might be used for scalar multiplication there (as we observed with one card), but
   can be taken as guidance that if ECDH leaks, ECDSA might as well (as is the case with
   another card).

#### Datasets

The datasets collected and used in the paper are available. They contain timing data collected from leaking implementations.
The files `data_*.csv` contain data in a CSV-like format (only the first line is not CSV):

```

<public key> <data> <private key>
<r1>,<s1>,<time1>
<r2>,<s2>,<time2>
...
<r>,<s>,<time>

```

Time is in nanoseconds. All of the datasets contain at least 50 000 signatures.

The `time_*.csv` files contain the processed data in a CSV format:

```

<time>,<lzb>

```

In it, each line represents a signature which has `lzb` leading-zero bits and took `time` nanoseconds.

### Technical details

Our attack is a lattice attack on the timing leakage of the bit-length of nonces used in ECDSA and other
similar signature algorithms, as presented in [[3]](#remote), with minor adaptations. The vulnerable devices and libraries trivially leak the bit-length of the
scalar used in scalar multiplication in ECDH, ECDSA and key generation (see the [next subsection](#details-leakage)).
The leakage is insignificant for ECDH and key generation as only the bit-length of the private key
is leaked, which represents a small amount of always the same information about the private key.

However, in the case of ECDSA or other signature schemes with random nonces, the bit-length of the random nonces is leaked. This is
much more significant as each signature then presents new usable information on the private key. The way this information
is used to recover the private key is via first converting the problem to an instance of the Hidden Number Problem, which we describe in [a section](#details-hnp) and
solving it via lattice reduction techniques.

#### Leakage

The following images were generated using our tool [ECTester](https://crocs-muni.github.io/ECTester/).

The images contain heatmaps demonstrating the dependency of signing duration and nonce bit-length, or in general, the dependency of
the duration of scalar multiplication on certain bits of the scalar. The example group of images shown first shows a well-behaving implementation
with no leakage.

For three out of five affected libraries (libgcrypt, MatrixSSL, SunEC) and
the affected smartcard (Athena IDProtect), the signing runtime directly depends on the bit-length
of the nonce linearly: each additional bit represents one more iteration of a loop in
scalar multiplication, which increases the runtime. The leakage can be clearly seen from
powertraces of the card performing ECDSA signing in Figure [a6](#athena-fig6).

For implementations leaking just the noisy bit-length (libgcrypt, SunEC, Athena IDProtect) the
leakage can be modeled using three parameters: duration of constant time processing in
signing (e.g., hashing) (\(base\)), duration of one iteration of the scalar multiplication loop
(\(iter\\_time\)) and the standard deviation of the noise (\(sdev\)). For the secp256r1 curve, the
leakage \(\mathbf{L}\) can be modelled as a random variable:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{L} &= base + iter\\_time \cdot \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{N} \\
\mathbf{B} &\sim \textbf{Geom}(p=1/2, (256, 255, \ldots, 0)) \\
\mathbf{N} &\sim \textbf{Norm}(0, sdev^2)
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\mathbf{B}\) represents the bit-length with a truncated geometric distribution and \(\mathbf{N}\) the noise.
Only two of the above parameters, \(iter\\_time\) and \(sdev\), affect how much the implementation leaks;
we will use them to assess how easy it is to mount an attack.

##### Example (no leakage)

Data collected from 500k signatures on secp256r1.

These images come from OpenSSL, contain no leakage and show how a well-behaving implementation
looks like in these types of heatmaps.

#### Hidden Number Problem

[Boneh & Venkatesan [1]](#hardness) introduced the *Hidden Number Problem* (HNP),
for proving the hardness of computing the most significant bits of keys in the Diffie-Hellman
scheme. They also showed a way to solve it by transforming it into a lattice *Closest Vector Problem* (CVP) solvable via lattice reduction and Babai's nearest plane algorithm. This is useful to us, because in the cases
of DSA/ECDSA/EdDSA and even attestation systems such as
EPID [[8]](#cachequote) or ECDAA [[9]](#fido-ecdaa), knowledge of the most significant bits of nonces with the goal of computing the private key can be turned into a Hidden Number Problem
instance, which can be turned into an instance of the Closest Vector Problem and solved using the methods of
lattice reduction. Next we will introduce the HNP and show how knowledge of most significant bits of nonces can be
turned into one for ECDSA.

**Notation:** In the following text:

* \( \lfloor x \rfloor\_n \) denotes the reduction to \( x \gmod{n} \).
* \( \lvert x \rvert\_n = \min\_{aÂ \in \mathbb{Z}} \lvert x - an \rvert\) denotes the distance to the nearest integer multiple of \( n \).
* \( pÂ \) denotes a prime number, \( g \) is a generator of \( \mathbb{Z}\_n \).
* \( G \) denotes a point of order \( n \) on an elliptic curve, usually the generator.
* \( d \) denotes the private key, and \( eÂ \)the amount of signatures.
* \( H(m) \) denotes the leftmost \( \log\_2(n)Â \) bits of the hash of the message \( m \), interpreted as an integer \( \gmod{n} \).
* \( k \) denotes the nonce used in signing.

**Definition 1 (Approximations):** By \(\mathrm{APP}\_{l,n}(y)\), we will denote any \(u\in\mathbb{Q}\) satisfying
\[\lvert y - u\rvert\_n \leq n/2^{l}.\]
Note that generally there are many such \(u\).

**Definition 2 (Most Significant Modular Bits):** The \(l>0\) most significant modular bits of an element \(y\in\mathbb{Z}\_n\) (regarded as an integer in \([0, n-1]\)) are the unique integer \(\mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y)\) such that
\[0 \leq y - \mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y)\cdot n/2^l < n/2^l.\]

It is worth observing that the most significant modular bits give rise to a specific approximation of \(y\). We can see directly from [definition 2](#def-msmb) that

\[\lvert y - \mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y)\cdot n/2^l \rvert < n/2^{l},\]
and since the absolute value argument already lies in \([-n/2, n/2]\), it is equivalent to
\[\lvert y - \mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y)\cdot n/2^l \rvert\_n < n/2^{l}.\]
Thus \(\mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y)\cdot n/2^l\) may be taken as \(\mathrm{APP}\_{l,n}(y)\). Also, after recentering the bits, \(\mathrm{MSMB}\_{l,n}(y) \cdot n/2^l - n/2^{l + 1}\) may be taken as \(\mathrm{APP}\_{l+1,n}(y)\).
**Definition 3 (Hidden Number Problem):** Given \( e \) approximations \(a\_i = \mathrm{APP}\_{l\_i,n}(k\_i)\), where \(k\_i = \lfloor \alpha t\_i - u\_i \rfloor\_n\),
for many known \(t\_i\) that are uniformly and independently distributed in \(\mathbb{Z}\_n^\*\), known \(u\_i\) and a fixed secret \(\alpha\in \mathbb{Z}\_n\), find \(\alpha\).

This general problem can be equivalently stated as, given \( e \) inequalities as below, with known \( a\_i \) and \( l\_i \) and with unknown \( \alpha \), find it:
\[
\lvert k\_i - a\_i\rvert\_n < n/2^{l\_i}
\]
##### ECDSA

In case of ECDSA, given the signature \( (r, s) \in \mathbb{Z}\_n \times \mathbb{Z}\_n \) on message
\( m \):
\[
\begin{aligned}
r &= ([k]G)\_x \pmod{n} \\
s &= k^{-1} (H(m) + r d) \pmod{n}
\end{aligned}
\]
Rewriting we have:
\[
\begin{aligned}
k &= s^{-1} (H(m) + r d) \pmod{n} \\
k &= s^{-1} H(m) + s^{-1} r d \pmod{n}
\end{aligned}
\]
Information about the most significant bits of \( k \), the nonce, can be used to construct an instance of the HNP.
**Definition 4 (ECDSA Hidden Number Problem):** Given \( e \) approximations \(a\_i = \mathrm{APP}\_{l\_i,n}(k\_i)\) of the nonces \( k\_i \) of known messages \( m\_i \),
find \( d \) (private key).

This gives us \( e \) inequalitites of the form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\lfloor k\_i - a\_i \rfloor\_n &< n/2^{l\_i} \\
%\lvert \lfloor k\_i \rfloor\_n - n/2^{l\_i + 1} - a\_i \rvert &< n/2^{l\_i + 1} \\
%\lvert \lfloor k\_i \rfloor\_n - n/2^{l\_i + 1} - a\_i \rvert\_n &< n/2^{l\_i + 1}
\lvert s\_i^{-1} \left(d r\_i + H(m\_i)\right) - a\_i \rvert\_n &< n/2^{l\_i}\\
\lvert d\lfloor s\_i^{-1}r\_i \rfloor\_n + \lfloor s\_i^{-1} H(m\_i)\rfloor\_n - a\_i\rvert\_n &< n/2^{l\_i}
\end{aligned}
\]
The above gives the HNP inequality with \(t\_i = s\_i^{-1} r\_i\) and \(u\_i = - s\_i^{-1} H(m\_i)\) as per [definition 3](#def-hnp). However, in this
case \(t\) is not completely uniform in \( \mathbb{Z}\_n^{\star} \), its distribution is just close enough that we do not have
to care about it [[2]](#insecurity). In our case of bit-length leakage, we will only ever create HNP inequalities with \( a\_i = MSMB\_{l\_i,n}(k\_i) = 0 \),
which simplifies the above equation to:
\[
\lvert t\_i d - u\_i \rvert\_n \lt n/2^{l\_i}
\]
##### Solving

Given \( e \) HNP inequalities of the form \( \lvert t\_i d - u\_i \rvert\_n \lt n/2^{l\_i} \), we can construct a lattice given by the rows of the matrix \( \mathbf{M} \)
[[7]](#rohnp):
\[
\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
2^{l\_1 + 1}n & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2^{l\_2 +1}n & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\
& \vdots & & & \vdots & \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 2^{l\_e +1}n & 0 \\
2^{l\_1 + 1}t\_1 & 2^{l\_2 +1}t\_2 & 2^{l\_3 +1}t\_3 & \ldots & 2^{l\_e +1}t\_e & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Where \( l\_i \) is the amount of known most significant bits of \( k\_i \) from the i-th signature.
Then, by our construction from the HNP inequalities above, the vector \(\mathbf{u} = ( 2^{l\_1 + 1}u\_1, \ldots, 2^{l\_e + 1}u\_e, 0) \) is a vector unusually close to a
lattice point. The closest lattice point often has a form \( \mathbf{v} = ( 2^{l\_1 + 1} t\_1 d, \ldots, 2^{l\_e + 1} t\_e d, d )
\), finding this lattice point then reveals the private key \( d \). To do so, one needs to solve the Closest Vector Problem.
There are several algorithms for solving the CVP, the original paper used Babai's nearest plane algorithm with LLL for lattice reduction.
One could also use BKZ for lattice reduction and then solve CVP by enumeration. There is also a technique of transforming an instance of CVP to a Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) by embedding the matrix and the target vector:
\[
C = \begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{M} & 0 \\
\mathbf{u} & n
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Then, one can solve SVP by lattice reduction and either looking directly at basis vectors or by further enumeration to find the shortest vector.
Our construction contained a number of heuristic arguments, such as "often has a form", or "is unusually close to a lattice point", this shows that
the technique is not exact. We also never stated how many HNP inequalities with what \(l\_i\) need to be included in the lattice to find the correct private key.

Generally, each inequality adds \( l\_i \) bits of information and the problem starts to be solvable (theoretically) as soon as the lattice contains more information
than the unknown information in the private key. The number of leading zero bits, which is equal to the used information in a signature in our attack, follows a truncated geometric
distribution with \(p = \frac{1}{2}\). Due to this, the expected amount of information in \(N\) signatures can be computed as
\(N \cdot \sum\_{i=2}^{\lceil \log\_2(n) \rceil} 2^{-l\_i-1} \cdot l\_i \approx \frac{3}{4}N\) assuming only signatures with \( l\_i \geq 2 \) are used.
Adding inequalities with \(l\_i < 2\) generally does not help, as those will not lead to the desired vector being unusually close to a lattice point.

Using the above formula, we obtain the expected minimum of around \(N = 342\) signatures for a 256-bit private key.
Since the amount of information is linear in \(N\) it can be computed as \(N \approx \frac{4}{3} \cdot |K|\) for size \(|K|\) of the private key.
Adding dimensions is also not for free, as the runtime of lattice algorithms grows significantly with an increase in the number of dimensions.
However, adding some overhead of information, such that the lattice contains around \( 1.3 \) times the information of the private key, was shown to improve the success rate [[7]](#rohnp).

#### Attack improvements

The nonces \(k\_i\) are generated uniformly at random; we can thus expect that the number of most significant zero bits follows
a truncated geometric distribution when \(n\) is close to a power of two. Thus roughly for one-half of the nonces \(l\_i=0\),
for one-quarter of nonces \(l\_i=1\), and so on. Assuming a one-to-one linear dependency between the bit-length of \(k\_i\) and
the duration of signing, we would obtain a clear method of assigning bounds to the signatures, sort them by duration and
apply the above distribution. However, the real timing leakage is noisy and the distributions of duration for signatures
with different bit-lengths overlap (see Figures [a4](#athena-fig4),[g3](#gcrypt-fig3),[m3](#matrixssl-fig3) and [s3](#sunec-fig3)).

Our main improvement to the attack calculates bounds according to the above truncated geometric distribution based on \(N\),
the number of signatures collected. One half of signatures has \(l\_i=0\), one quarter has \(l\_i=1\), etc.
Then simply the fastest \(e\) signatures are taken with their calculated bounds.

boxplots of the distribution of the difference of the simulated data and the
bounds (**sim - geom**). Negative values imply an error; positive implies some
available information is unused.
##### Evaluation

We evaluated our improvements using four separate data sets (denoted as sim, sw, card,
tpm) with varying levels of noise. All the datasets used consist of at least 50 000 ECDSA
signatures over the secp256r1 curve from which we randomly sample \(N\) signatures for the
evaluation of our attacks.

| Dataset | \(base (\mu s)\) | \(iter\\_time (\mu s)\) | \(sdev (\mu s)\) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sim | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| sw | 453.4 | 12.7 | 17.2 |
| tpm | 27047.3 | 236.1 | 211.3 |
| card | 43578.4 | 371.5 | 451.3 |

* The sim dataset contains simulated data for which there is an exact one-to-one
  correspondence between the signing duration and the bit-length of the random nonce
  with no systematic noise. However, these simulated signatures were still generated
  by uniformly randomly selecting the random nonce and computing the number of
  most-signifcant zero bits. A given sample is thus a result of a random process and
  varies naturally.
* The sw dataset contains data from a vulnerable version of the software cryptographic
  library libgcrypt collected from a simple C program on an ordinary Linux laptop.
* The tpm dataset contains data from the recent work of Moghimi et al. [[14]](#tpm-fail)
  collected from a vulnerable STMicroelectronics TPM (Trusted Platform Module).
  The data was collected via a custom Linux kernel module and contained a relatively
  small amount of noise.
* The card dataset contains data from the vulnerable Athena IDProtect smartcard,
  collected by a Python script running on an ordinary Linux laptop with a standard
  standalone smartcard reader connected. Such measurements are particularly noisy
  due to the complex software stack and hardware components between the script and
  a card.

#### Root causes of the vulnerability

We consider there to be several root causes for this group of vulnerabilities. One of them is that knowledge of the
fragility of DSA nonces to lattice attacks does not seem to be widespread amongst developers of
cryptographic software. There are four issues regarding nonce use in DSA:
nonce reuse, bias in nonce randomness, nonce bit-length leaks and other leaks of partial information about nonces. Due
to the aforementioned lattice attacks and their variants, all of these issues might lead to a private key recovery attack.

Deterministic generation of nonces, as done in EdDSA or RFC6979 mitigates
the issues of nonce reuse and nonce bias. However, it does not address the latter two in any significant way.
Deterministic generation of nonces might actually help the attacker in case the attacker has a noisy side-channel
leaking nonce bit-length or other information about the nonce. If the attacker can observe the signing of the same
message multiple times, they might use the fact that the same nonce was used to significantly reduce the noise in the side-channel.

Another cause for this group of vulnerabilities is that not leaking the bit-length of the scalar used in scalar
multiplication is surprisingly hard. Take almost any algorithm that processes the scalar in a left to right fashion, the
Montgomery ladder for example, and instantiate it with addition formulas that are incomplete (cannot correctly compute
\( \mathcal{O} + P \) or \( 2\mathcal{O} \) in a side-channel indistinguishable way from \( P + Q \) and \( 2P \)), then
a side-channel leaking the bit-length will be present.

At the start of the ladder for computing a multiple of point
\( G\), the two ladder variables are initialized either as \( R\_0 = \mathcal{O} \) and \( R\_1 = G \) or as
\( R\_0 = G \) and \( R\_1 = 2G \). In the first case, the computation might start at any bit larger that the most
significant set bit in the scalar, i.e. it can be a fixed loop bound, for example on the bit-length of the order of the
generator, as seen in [algorithm 1](#montgomery-complete). However, until the first set bit is encountered,
all of the additions and doublings will involve the point at
infinity and because of our assumption that the formulas used are incomplete, they will leak this through some side-channel.
This leak might have the form of short-circuiting addition formulas, which check whether the point at infinity was input and short circuit accordingly to satisfy
\( \mathcal{O} + P = P \) and \( 2\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O} \). This is the case in libgcrypt
for example, and was the reason why simply fixing a loop bound in scalar multiplication was not enough to fix the issue.
The formulas might leak the fact that the point at infinity is present through different channels than timing: power or
EM side-channels come to mind, as the point at infinity is often represented using only \( 0 \) or \( 1 \) values, which
can often be distinguishable in multiplication and addition on a power trace.

```

                \begin{algorithm}
                \caption{Montgomery ladder (complete)}
                \begin{algorithmic}
                \PROCEDURE{Ladder}{$G, k = (k_{l}, \ldots, k_0)_2$}
                    \STATE $R_0 = \mathcal{O}$; $R_1 = G$
                    \FOR{$i = l$ \DOWNTO 0}
                        \STATE $R_{\neg k_i} = R_0 + R_1$; $R_{k_i} = 2R_{k_i}$
                    \ENDFOR
                    \RETURN $R_0$
                \ENDPROCEDURE
                \end{algorithmic}
                \end{algorithm}

```

In the second case, the most significant bit of the scalar must be explicitly found, as seen in
[algorithm 2](#montgomery-incomplete) and the ladder must start at that bit, because the variables were
initialized into a state such that the point at infinity will not appear so that incomplete formulas could be used and no
infinity ever handled. If the loop started at some fixed bit past the most significant bit set, this algorithm would compute an incorrect result.
However, this clearly leaks the bit-length through timing alone, because of the loop bound on the bit-length of the
scalar.

```

                \begin{algorithm}
                \caption{Montgomery ladder (incomplete)}
                \begin{algorithmic}
                \PROCEDURE{Ladder}{$G, k = (k_{l}, \ldots, k_0)_2$}
                    \STATE $R_0 = G$; $R_1 = 2G$
                    \FOR{$i = \vert k \vert - 1$ \DOWNTO 0}
                        \STATE $R_{\neg k_i} = R_0 + R_1$; $R_{k_i} = 2R_{k_i}$
                    \ENDFOR
                    \RETURN $R_0$
                \ENDPROCEDURE
                \end{algorithmic}
                \end{algorithm}

```

Furthermore, in the name of performance, cryptographic libraries often include multiple optimized scalar
multiplication algorithms that are either chosen at compile time or even at runtime, for specific classes
of curves, or for use by a specific cryptosystem. This increases the effort necessary to test and verify that all of
the possible configurations are constant time and not vulnerable. As mentioned before, there are interactions
between the individual components such as addition formulas, coordinate systems and the scalar multiplication algorithm,
a change in one of those can make an implementation vulnerable, like using incomplete formulas that short circuit
the special cases. The configurations in libraries are often behind many define guards that enable parts of
functions, such that even figuring out which scalar multiplication function using which coordinate model and
addition formulas gets executed by a library for a particular operation on a particular curve is non-trivial.

Taking the example of the ECC implementation in SunEC/OpenJDK, in the
latest version, it contains both a Java implementation of ECC and a native one. The Java one is chosen if one of the
secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1 curves is
detected. The native implementation contains arithmetic for affine, Jacobian and Modified Jacobian coordinates. It
contains 4 scalar multiplication algorithms for prime field curves and three wrapper functions which dispatch to
appropriate functions. For some reason, the simple
scalar multiplication in ECDSA is performed through a call to a multi-scalar multiplication
wrapper, which dispatches it to a multi-scalar multiplication function which short circuits to a single-scalar
multiplication wrapper, because some of the arguments are null, this wrapper then finally dispatches to the appropriate
scalar multiplication function.

The cause of the vulnerability in cards using the Atmel Toolbox 00.03.11.05 is obvious, the toolbox
included functionality explicitly marked as not protected against SPA/DPA and timing attacks, which the vulnerable cards decided to use.

### Responsible disclosure

##### Athena IDProtect

We have discovered the vulnerability on 18.03.2019 in the Athena IDProtect card. To confirm its
exploitablity we have investigated it in more
detail in the following days and constructed a proof-of-concept which can be downloaded [above](#poc).
Following this, we have contacted the responsible party: NXP Semiconductors,
on 15.04.2019 at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT`. We
chose to contact NXP because the Athena Smart Card Solutions company, which produced the Athena
IDProtect cards, no longer exists, as it was bought by NXP in 2015 [[11]](#athena).

NXP Semiconductors confirmed the existence of the vulnerability on 19.04.2019 and stated that they
had migrated the former Athena IDProtect product line to
their hardware shortly after the acquisition, which effectively mitigated the vulnerability in newer products
based on the IDProtect line, long before our discovery, as it was present in the underlying cryptographic
library which was replaced along with the hardware. Furthermore, NXP discontinued the former Athena IDProtect line of
products a few years after the acquisition.

NXP Semiconductors was able to confirm that the Athena IDProtect card on the AT90SC chip indeed did use
the fast and insecure version of the ECDSA functionality from the Atmel Toolbox. Quoting the reply from
NXP Semiconductors:

> The vulnerability you found is in the Atmel crypto library that implements the ECC cryptography on the affected product.
> The Athena SCS product affected here is a legacy product which is no longer promoted by NXP.

##### WiseKey

After communicating with NXP Semiconductors, we contacted WiseKey, the current holder of the intellectual property of
the AT90 chip, cryptographic toolbox and associated items, and notified them of the vulnerability in the past versions of the Atmel toolbox.
We then explained details of the vulnerability during a call with the WiseKey cryptography team. We have no information on
whether current versions of the chip and toolbox are vulnerable.

##### Libgcrypt

After discovering the vulnerability on a smart-card, we analyzed many open-source cryptographic
libraries, we discovered the vulnerability in libgcrypt
on 09.07.2019, and notified the libgcrypt security team at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT`
on 12.07.2019. We coordinated on mitigating the issue and arrived at a final working patch on 18.07.2019, which was
merged on 07.08.2019.

##### wolfSSL

We discovered the leakage in wolfSSL on 09.07.2019 and notified wolfSSL at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT` on 11.07.2019. We received a patch
for testing on 12.07.2019, which fixed the issue. The fix for the issue was merged to the master branch on 17.07.2019.

##### MatrixSSL

We discovered the vulnerability in MatrixSSL on 11.07.2019, we notified MatrixSSL support at
`ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT` on 11.07.2019 and
at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT` (which looked like the maintainer's address from github commits) on
12.07.2019. We have not heard back from any of the addresses. MatrixSSL had a release in the meantime, which fixed some issues
but this vulnerability remains unpatched as of 02.10.2019.

##### Crypto++

We discovered the leakage in Crypto++ on 22.07.2019 and notified the Crypto++ team
on 25.07.2019. The main parts of the fix for the issue were merged to the master branch on 29.07.2019 and 05.08.2019.

##### SunEC

We discovered the leakage in SunEC on 22.07.2019 and notified Oracle at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT` on 26.07.2019. We provided Oracle with a patch
mitigating the issue on 14.08.2019. Furthermore, we notified the OpenJDK vulnerability group on 15.09.2019 at `ENABLE@JAVASCRIPT`. The vulnerability remains unpatched in the
public [jdk](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk) repository as of 02.10.2019.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 219 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2566015.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
