{
  "CVE-2019-2894": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is related to a side-channel leakage in the ECDSA implementation within OpenJDK. Specifically, the bit-length of the scalar used during scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve is leaked. This information can be exploited using lattice techniques to recover the private key after observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures on known messages.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is a side-channel leakage in the ECDSA implementation's scalar multiplication process, where the bit-length of the scalar is exposed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability",
      "Timing leak",
       "Insufficient protection against side-channel attacks during ECDSA operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact of exploitation is the recovery of the long-term private key. This allows an attacker to impersonate the victim, sign arbitrary data, or decrypt data encrypted using the compromised key.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Timing analysis of ECDSA signing operations",
      "Side-channel analysis via timing"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to measure the duration of ECDSA signing operations. This could involve local or remote access, depending on the specific circumstances. The attacker needs to observe hundreds to thousands of signatures on known messages."
