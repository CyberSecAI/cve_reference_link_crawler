The provided content is related to CVE-2023-39827.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `formAddMacfilterRule` function of the Tenda A18 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The `formAddMacfilterRule` function doesn't validate the length of the `deviceList` parameter received from user input.
- Unsafe function usage: The `parse_macfilter_rule` function uses `strcpy` to copy user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer (`rule_info`), without any length checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack overflow leading to a crash: By providing an overly long `deviceList` parameter, the attacker can overflow the stack buffer, causing the router to crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: With a carefully constructed payload (beyond the provided crash PoC) within the overflow, an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution and obtain a root shell on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setBlackRule` endpoint with a crafted `deviceList` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. This could be a user on the local network or an attacker with access to the router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to know the correct URL endpoint, the format of the required POST parameters, and potentially valid authentication cookies to access the vulnerable function.
