- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-uploaded files on Gradio servers. Specifically, the lack of proper handling allows users to upload HTML, JavaScript, or SVG files containing malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute malicious scripts within other users' browsers when they download or view the uploaded files. This can lead to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, and theft of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is file uploads. An attacker uploads a malicious HTML, JavaScript, or SVG file to the Gradio server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to upload files to the Gradio server.
