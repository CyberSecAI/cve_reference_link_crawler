Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8546:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-8546. It specifically highlights a stored XSS vulnerability in the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin's Video widget.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the plugin's Video widget. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is stored XSS. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored and later executed within the user's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-provided data, specifically within the video URL field, is not sanitized before being saved to the database.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The stored malicious script is not properly escaped when rendered on a web page, allowing it to be executed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, leading to potentially harmful actions, including:
    - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites or other malicious resources.
    - Defacing the website by modifying page content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Other attacks that JavaScript can execute.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the Video widget of the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin.
- An attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress website to create or modify content. They then use the plugin's video widget to insert the malicious script via the `ekit_video_self_external_url` field.
- Any user who visits a page containing the injected video widget will be affected, as the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress website with "Contributor" or higher access.
- **Access to Elementor Editor:** Ability to create or edit pages/posts using the Elementor page builder.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability in the video widget of the ElementsKit plugin.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerable file is `elementskit-lite/trunk/widgets/video/parts/video-button.php` and `elementskit-lite/trunk/widgets/video/video.php`
- The fix was implemented in version 3.2.8.
- The vulnerability was reported by "zer0gh0st".
- The fix included changes such as:
  - Adding dynamic tag support to video URL field.
  - Sanitizing and escaping the output `ekit_video_self_external_url` with `esc_url` before rendering.
  - Adding a validation check to ensure the URL is valid.

In summary, CVE-2024-8546 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the ElementsKit Elementor addons plugin that allows authenticated users with contributor-level access to inject malicious scripts. This can lead to serious security issues for any user who views a page containing the injected video widget, but was patched in version 3.2.8.
