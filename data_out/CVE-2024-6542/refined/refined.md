- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A lack of proper input sanitization within the `mknotifyd` component allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary livestatus commands by crafting a malicious notification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Livestatus command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary livestatus commands. The specific impact would depend on the context of the commands executed, but it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of monitoring data, denial of service or other malicious activity. The CVE description notes a CVSS score of 6.5 with a medium severity. Impact is rated as low for confidentiality, low for integrity, low for availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. It exploits the `mknotifyd`'s processing of notifications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send notifications to `mknotifyd`. No specific privileges are explicitly mentioned in the provided text but the CVSS vector suggests that no privileges are required (PR:N).
