- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the inability of the Cisco AppDynamics Network Visibility Agent to handle unexpected input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to a denial of service. Specifically, the agent does not handle unexpected HTTP requests correctly.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by stopping the Network Agent Service on the local device.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with local device access can exploit the vulnerability by sending an HTTP request to the targeted service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the device running the vulnerable Cisco AppDynamics Network Visibility Agent. No authentication is required. The user interface interaction is required (UI:R).
