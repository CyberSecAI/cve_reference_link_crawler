- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of an SQL parameter in the `send.php` file of the "Orders (CSV, Excel) Export PRO" module for PrestaShop. The module was not sanitizing user-provided input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `key` and `save_setting` variables were not properly escaped before being used in a DELETE query on the `exported_order` table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-controlled input in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Steal or remove data from the associated PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data from the database.
    - Rewrite SMTP settings, potentially leading to hijacking emails.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through network attacks by sending HTTP POST or GET requests with malicious values for the `key` or `save_setting` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They can be anonymous.
