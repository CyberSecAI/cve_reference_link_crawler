| Thanks for flagging this, and apologies for the delay in following up.  The affected code has been removed from `langchain` as of version `v0.0.247`.  Unfortunately, Python sandboxing from inside the process itself is an extremely difficult problem, and impossible to get right in practice ‚Äî so much so that many security CTF competitions feature a "break this Python sandbox" problem. The best practice for running untrusted code like that is running the code inside an externally-created sandbox, which cannot be created from inside the `langchain-experimental` package itself and must be arranged by the user of the code instead.  We therefore felt it was best to move the affected code to the experimental package, and add prominent security notices reminding the user of the code of the need for additional security considerations before the code may be safely used.  Here is the full list of corrective action we've taken:   * Since `CPAL` chains require unique security considerations, we decided to move that code to our `langchain-experimental` package. It was added there in [remove CVEs¬†#8092](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/8092) and it was removed from `langchain` itself in [remove code¬†#8425](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/8425). Releases starting with `langchain v0.0.247` and onward no longer include this code ‚Äî it must be used from the `langchain-experimental` package instead. * We are adding prominent security notices on the affected class and the usual ways of constructing it. These notices remind the user of the need for security sandboxing external to the running process. PR for that here: [Add security notices on PAL and CPAL experimental chains.¬†#9938](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/9938) * We are also adding a prominent security notice to the `langchain-experimental` package itself, to document its experimental and security-sensitive nature and encourage users to take appropriate security precautions to protect their systems and their data: [Add notice about security-sensitive experimental code to experimental README.¬†#9936](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/9936) |
