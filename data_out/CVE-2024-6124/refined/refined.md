The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation which leads to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It stems from the fact that certain input values are not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability (CWE-79) is present.
- Input validation and sanitization are lacking.
- Open redirect vulnerability is mentioned in the title, which may be linked to the XSS although the description doesn't clarify that point explicitly

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.
- The impact of the vulnerability depends on the user's access level.
- Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or stealing of sensitive user data

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L) .
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:A). The attacker must trick the user into clicking a specially crafted link.
- There are no special privileges required (PR:N) for the attacker to execute the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link or visiting the malicious page.
