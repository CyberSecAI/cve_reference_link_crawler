Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-29736

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Apache CXF handles WADL (Web Application Description Language) service descriptions. Specifically, it's triggered when a custom stylesheet parameter is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The core vulnerability is an SSRF. This means an attacker can potentially cause the server to make requests to other internal or external resources that the server has access to, but the attacker doesn't.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Data Modification:** Exploitation could enable attackers to add or modify data.
- The NetApp advisory states "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data". This confirms the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed through a vulnerable WADL service description.
- Specifically, it requires a custom stylesheet parameter to be configured in Apache CXF

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with a web service that utilizes Apache CXF with a vulnerable configuration (custom stylesheet parameter).
- No specific details on attacker network position is given.

**Affected Software:**
- Apache CXF versions prior to 4.0.5, 3.6.4, and 3.5.9 are vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**
- NetApp products incorporating affected Apache CXF versions are also vulnerable. The NetApp advisory lists specific affected products like:
    - Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
    - Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    - Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
    - ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 9

- NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
- No workarounds are available.
- Patches will be available through the NetApp Support website.
