Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `/sys/duplicate/check` API endpoint of the jeecg-boot framework. The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `tableName` and `fieldName` parameters, which are directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject SQL code that uses time-delaying functions (like `sleep()`) to infer information about the database structure and data by observing the response time.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, particularly within the `tableName` and `fieldName` parameters allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL code
- **Bypass of SQL Injection Checks:** The provided code snippets reveal attempts to mitigate SQL injection. However, the vulnerability demonstrates these checks can be bypassed.
- **Use of Unsafe Character Encoding:** The exploit leverages the `%09` encoding to bypass input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting SQL queries that reveal data through time-based responses.
- **Database Compromise:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to the complete compromise of the database, allowing attackers to modify or delete data.
- **Application Availability Impact:** Malicious actors could potentially leverage the sleep function to slow down application performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint.
- **Manipulated URL Parameters:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `tableName` and `fieldName` parameters in the URL query string.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** The vulnerability uses time delays introduced by SQL functions such as `sleep()` to extract information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application and specifically the `/sys/duplicate/check` API endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know the structure and parameters of the `/sys/duplicate/check` endpoint
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must understand SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in jeecg-boot versions prior to 3.5.0, which was released on 2023-03-08.
- A PoC is provided which uses the `sleep()` function to demonstrate the time-based injection.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using `%09` encoded characters to bypass existing SQL injection filters.
- The fix appears to involve specific validation for functions that can be used to induce time delays like `sleep()`.
- The vulnerability exists in the duplicate check functionality, which is intended to ensure uniqueness.

**Mitigation:**
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection
- Use of parameterized queries
- Blacklisting of time-based injection functions, such as `sleep`, `BENCHMARK`, etc.
- Proper input escaping of characters such as quotes, backslashes, etc.
