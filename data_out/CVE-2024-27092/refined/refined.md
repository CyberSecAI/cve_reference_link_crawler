Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2024-27092**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation for fields like the "Team Name" within the Hoppscotch application. This allows malicious users to inject arbitrary content into these fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the "Team Name" field.
- **Content Spoofing:** Due to the lack of validation, attackers can craft team names containing malicious content that will be included in invitation emails, making it appear as if the emails are genuine communications from Hoppscotch.
- **Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79):** Although not explicitly stated, the potential for XSS exists, given that arbitrary content can be injected and rendered. The report focuses on content spoofing via email but mentions CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Spoofed Email Content:** Attackers can send emails that appear to be from Hoppscotch, but contain malicious or misleading content. This content could include links to phishing sites or other malicious URLs.
- **Disinformation and Reputation Damage:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to inject vulgar, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate content, damaging the reputation of Hoppscotch.
- **Increased Risk of Phishing:** By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can make their phishing attempts more convincing because the spoofed content is sent in legitimate Hoppscotch emails.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of Hoppscotch.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to open and read the spoofed email.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists in the `team-invitation.service.ts` file within the Hoppscotch backend. Specifically, it's related to how the application uses user input in the team invitation emails. The attacker manipulates the "Team Name" field and includes potentially malicious content such as links.

**Patch Information:**
The vulnerability was patched in version `2023.12.6` of Hoppscotch. The fix likely involves sanitizing or validating the "Team Name" field to prevent the injection of malicious content. The commit `6827e97ec583b2534cdc1c2f33fa44973a0c2bf5` contains changes to address how links are handled in the email templates, specifically in `team-invitation.hbs` and `user-invitation.hbs`. This commit introduces the `nohighlight` class to avoid highlighting certain links in the email, which may be part of the mitigation strategy.

**CVSS Score:**
The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4, with the following vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`

This indicates a moderate severity level, based on the following:

-   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
-   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
-   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
-   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
-   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
-   **C:L** (Confidentiality: Low)
-   **I:L** (Integrity: Low)
-   **A:N** (Availability: None)
