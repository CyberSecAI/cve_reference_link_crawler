{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `addWifiMacFilter` function in Tenda FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408) firmware is vulnerable to a stack overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack buffer overflow exists because the `deviceId` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function to copy data into a local stack variable without proper bounds checking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The stack overflow can overwrite the function's return address, leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/addWifiMacFilter` endpoint with a long value in the `deviceId` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device, implying network access to the device's web interface."
