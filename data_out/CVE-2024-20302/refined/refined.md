- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access controls within the tenant security implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access controls that allow authenticated users with specific privileges to modify or delete tenant templates they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify or delete tenant templates under non-associated tenants, potentially disrupting network traffic.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attack via a valid user account with *write* privileges and either a Site Manager or Tenant Manager role.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a valid user account with *write* privileges and either a Site Manager or Tenant Manager role on the affected Cisco NDO system. They must also have network access to the system.
