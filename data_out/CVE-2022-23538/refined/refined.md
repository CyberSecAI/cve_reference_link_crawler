Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23538:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `scs-library-client` incorrectly including the HTTP `Authorization` header when following redirects to a third-party S3 storage server during a multi-part concurrent download. This behavior leaks user credentials to the S3 service if it is hosted by a different domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Leakage:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of the `Authorization` header in a request to a different domain.
- **Lack of Domain Checking:** The code did not properly verify that the redirect target belonged to the same domain before including credentials.
- **CWE-522:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Impersonation:** An attacker with access to the third-party S3 service could extract user credentials from the leaked `Authorization` header, allowing them to impersonate the user.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to resources associated with the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **HTTP Redirect:** The vulnerability is triggered when the library service redirects the client to an S3 backing storage server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to S3 Service:** The attacker needs to have access to the third-party S3 service that is the target of the redirect.
- **Man-in-the-Middle is NOT required:** The attacker does not need to intercept the traffic. They receive the leaked credentials directly via the S3 service.
- **Singularity Enterprise 1.x or Similar Server:** The vulnerable flow is specific to interactions with Singularity Enterprise 1.x (or similar servers) that use a multi-part download flow with a redirect to S3.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is triggered in a specific download flow, used with Singularity Enterprise 1.x or third-party servers that implement the described flow.
- This issue does not affect Singularity Enterprise 2.x, or Singularity Container Services.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the `Authorization` header is only included when the redirect URL is to the same host.
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in `scs-library-client` versions 1.3.4 (commit [68ac4ca](https://github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client/commit/68ac4cab5cda0afd8758ff5b5e2e57be6a22fcfa) in the 1.3 series) and 1.4.2 (commit [eebd7ca](https://github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client/commit/eebd7caaab310b1fa803e55b8fc1acd9dcd2d00c) in the 1.4 series).
- The fix ensures that credentials are only passed when redirected to the same host by using the `samehost()` function to check the redirect domain.

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v3: 5.2 Moderate
- AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
