Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1950

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data within the "Product Carousel Slider & Grid Ultimate for WooCommerce" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses `unserialize()` on base64 decoded data retrieved from post meta, and this data is not validated or sanitized before being unserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core weakness is the use of `unserialize()` on untrusted data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP objects into the application's memory.
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The plugin doesn't properly validate or sanitize the data before deserializing, making it vulnerable to object injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Conditional):** If a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain exists in another plugin or the theme used on the WordPress site, an attacker can leverage the object injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. This could lead to:
    - **Arbitrary file deletion.**
    - **Retrieval of sensitive data.**
    - **Complete system compromise**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned, it's possible that a carefully crafted serialized object could also cause a denial-of-service condition by exhausting resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered by the use of the plugin's shortcodes, which retrieve post meta data that's unserialized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor access or higher to create or edit posts and insert the malicious shortcode.
- **POP Chain (Conditional):** Successful exploitation leading to RCE (Remote Code Execution) is conditional on the existence of a POP chain in other installed plugins or the theme. Without a POP chain present, the object injection vulnerability by itself cannot be exploited to achieve RCE, but may still be used to cause DoS or other unforeseen issues.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in `includes/classes/class-shortcode.php`, where the plugin uses `Woocmmerce_Product_carousel_slider_ultimate::unserialize_and_decode24()` to process post meta data.
- The `class-meta-box.php` file is also relevant as it contains the code that serializes and encodes the data before storing it in the database which can then be later unserialized and exploited
- The `unserialize_and_decode24` function performs a base64 decode followed by unserialization.
- The fix in version 1.9.8 replaces the base64 encoded serialized data with json encoded data, and uses `json_decode()` to process it, mitigating the PHP Object Injection vulnerability.
- Additionally, a migration function was introduced in `main.php` to convert existing serialized data to JSON.

In summary, the plugin's flawed handling of serialized data allows authenticated users to inject PHP objects, which can potentially lead to severe security breaches if a POP chain exists on the system. The patch addresses the vulnerability by switching to JSON encoding and decoding, thus preventing the direct injection of malicious objects.
