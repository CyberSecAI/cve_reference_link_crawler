The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45622.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user input within the login mechanism. Specifically, the `username` parameter in the login form is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the login functionality.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass authentication.
- Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application's admin panel.
- Attackers could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- In some cases, attackers might execute arbitrary administration operations on the database or operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted login request containing a SQL injection payload within the `username` field.
- This is achieved through a web interface via an HTTP POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the login page of the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are needed prior to exploitation.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web server.

**Additional details:**
- The specific vulnerable parameter is the `username` field in the login form.
- Several example payloads are provided to demonstrate the SQL injection vulnerability, including `'#`, `--`, `||1#`,  `||1--`, `'=' 'or'`, `' OR '1'='1`, `' or 0=0 ##`.
- A sample Burp request is provided, illustrating the vulnerability using the payload `' or 0=0 ##`.
- The vulnerability is located in the `index.php` file related to the authentication mechanism.
- The affected software is "ASIS | Aplikasi Sistem Sekolah using CodeIgniter 3" with version 3.0.0 < 3.2.0.
- The recommended fix is updating the application code to properly sanitize user inputs and restrict special characters.
