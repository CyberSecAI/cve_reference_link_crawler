Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `edit_room.php` file of the "Simple Online Hotel Reservation System in PHP Project With Source Code 1.0".
- Specifically, line 9 of `edit_room.php` directly uses the input obtained through the `$_FILES` variable without any sanitization or validation. This input is used to determine the file storage location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The lack of input validation on the filename from `$_FILES` allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary extensions and potentially overwrite existing files.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input for file uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files.
- **File Injection:** Malicious files can be injected into the system.
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to perform directory traversal attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could upload large files to consume server resources, leading to denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker could achieve remote code execution, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP POST request to `edit_room.php`
- Attackers can use a multipart/form-data request to upload a malicious file with a crafted filename via the `photo` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `edit_room.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request, including a malicious file to be uploaded via the `photo` parameter.
