| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c0)  Marian Rehak    2021-11-30 13:05:20 UTC  ``` The vulnerability can lead to heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted sound file, and potentially control heap data by forge buffer content to perform heap exploitation.  Upstream Reference:  <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/issues/731>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c1)  Marian Rehak    2021-11-30 13:05:33 UTC  ``` Created libsndfile tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2027692](show_bug.cgi?id=2027692 "CLOSED ERRATA - libsndfile: heap-buffer-overflow in src/flac.c in flac_buffer_copy [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-12-09 00:54:00 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  There's an out-of-bounds READ possible in libsndfile's flac_buffer_copy() routine in flac.c. This could be triggered by a specially crafted file that is processed by a program linked with libsndfile.  Technical detail:  In the following for loop:                                  for (i = 0 ; i < len && pflac->remain > 0 ; i++)                                 {       offset = pflac->pos + i * channels ;                                          if (pflac->bufferpos >= frame->header.blocksize)                                                 break ;                                          if (offset + channels > pflac->len)                                                 break ;                                          for (j = 0 ; j < channels ; j++)                                                 retpcm [offset + j] = ((uint32_t) buffer [j][pflac->bufferpos]) << shift ;                                         pflac->remain -= channels ;                                         pflac->bufferpos++ ;                                         } ;                                 } ;   We see that there's an if check to ensure the loop terminates if pflac->bufferpos >= frame->header.blocksize.  In this case, frame->header.blocksize can be set to a value greater than the size of `buffer`, and since `buffer` is indexed by `pflac->bufferpos`, the loop will not terminate before causing an out-of-bounds read when reading `buffer`.  The upstream patch[1] introduces a check to prevent the above, and errors out upon failure.  1. <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/pull/732/commits/4c30646abf7834e406f7e2429c70bc254e18beab>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 14:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:1968 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1968](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1968)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-10 19:45:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
