{
  "CVE-2021-4156": {
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality. An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user to open or otherwise) to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory information that could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the `flac_buffer_copy` function within `src/flac.c`. The code does not properly validate the `frame->header.blocksize` against the allocated size of the `buffer`, leading to an out-of-bounds read when `frame->header.blocksize` is larger than the buffer's allocated size.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "Impact": "An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash due to memory access violations. It can potentially leak sensitive memory information, which could be used in further exploitation of other vulnerabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted FLAC file to an application using the vulnerable `libsndfile` library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted FLAC file to a user, who then must open this file using an application that uses the vulnerable libsndfile library."
