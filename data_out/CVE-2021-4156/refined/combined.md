| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c0)  Marian Rehak    2021-11-30 13:05:20 UTC  ``` The vulnerability can lead to heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted sound file, and potentially control heap data by forge buffer content to perform heap exploitation.  Upstream Reference:  <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/issues/731>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c1)  Marian Rehak    2021-11-30 13:05:33 UTC  ``` Created libsndfile tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2027692](show_bug.cgi?id=2027692 "CLOSED ERRATA - libsndfile: heap-buffer-overflow in src/flac.c in flac_buffer_copy [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c2)  Todd Cullum    2021-12-09 00:54:00 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  There's an out-of-bounds READ possible in libsndfile's flac_buffer_copy() routine in flac.c. This could be triggered by a specially crafted file that is processed by a program linked with libsndfile.  Technical detail:  In the following for loop:                                  for (i = 0 ; i < len && pflac->remain > 0 ; i++)                                 {       offset = pflac->pos + i * channels ;                                          if (pflac->bufferpos >= frame->header.blocksize)                                                 break ;                                          if (offset + channels > pflac->len)                                                 break ;                                          for (j = 0 ; j < channels ; j++)                                                 retpcm [offset + j] = ((uint32_t) buffer [j][pflac->bufferpos]) << shift ;                                         pflac->remain -= channels ;                                         pflac->bufferpos++ ;                                         } ;                                 } ;   We see that there's an if check to ensure the loop terminates if pflac->bufferpos >= frame->header.blocksize.  In this case, frame->header.blocksize can be set to a value greater than the size of `buffer`, and since `buffer` is indexed by `pflac->bufferpos`, the loop will not terminate before causing an out-of-bounds read when reading `buffer`.  The upstream patch[1] introduces a check to prevent the above, and errors out upon failure.  1. <https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/pull/732/commits/4c30646abf7834e406f7e2429c70bc254e18beab>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-05-10 14:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2022:1968 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1968](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1968)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2027690#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-05-10 19:45:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| Hi, I found a vulnerability in current master [34bd39b](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/commit/34bd39b9b513ce6267d7b1b7cd2af56697eb2f24).  There is a heap-buffer-overflow in src/flac.c:274:41 in flac\_buffer\_copy.  The vulnerability can lead to heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted sound file, and potentially control heap data by forge `buffer` content to perform heap exploitation.

| [@evpobr](https://github.com/evpobr) When `i=0, j=0, channels=1, offset=0, pflac->bufferpos=1152, frame->header.blocksize=32768` at  ``` retpcm [offset + j] = ((uint32_t) buffer [j][pflac->bufferpos]) << shift ; ```  ASAN triggered  The `frame->header.blocksize / 4` is larger than the `(uint32_t*)buffer` size, because it reuse the `buffer` for `header.blocksize=1152`.  What do you think about it need to request larger size or it is not make a sense that `frame->header.blocksize` become larger. |

| Hi [@evpobr](https://github.com/evpobr) [@arthurt](https://github.com/arthurt),  I reproduced the vulnerability on the old released version 1.0.28, the older version is too old that I can't compile it with ASAN. At least this bug affects >= 1.0.28 to the latest released version 1.0.31, and even affects current master.  This vulnerability exists in the shared library, not binary, and it is easy to be exploited because the overflow length and content of the buffer can be easily controlled by the crafted sound file.  It should be fixed as soon as possible, Thanks! |

| [@yuawn](https://github.com/yuawn) could you please elaborate on:  The vulnerability can lead to heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted sound file, and potentially control heap data by forge buffer content to perform heap exploitation.   1. When you use the term "heap-based buffer overflow" are you referring to a buffer overREAD or a WRITE? 2. ASAN shows this as an out-of-bounds READ of 4 bytes 3. What type of heap exploitation are you referring to? I am not intimately familiar with libsndfile, but this seems to be a case where data is overread from `buffer` (`pflac->wbuffer`), bitshifted left, and then stored in `retpcm` (which essentially points to `psf->codec_data->ptr`). I'm not sure all of what data pointed to by that pointer is used for, but at this point it seems it's just an out-of-bounds read storing data in the flac blob.   Am I missing something? |

| Hi [@tcullum-rh](https://github.com/tcullum-rh),   1. buffer over-read 2. It can be more since the vulnerable code is in the loop and the number of iteration is attacker-controlled 3. I want to summarize that the bug can be used to leak information and defeat ASLR by reading out-of-bounds on heap segment, and then could be combined with heap exploitation techniques (e.g., Forging chunks, T-cache dup, fastbin attack ...).   I hope I answered your question, thank you! |

## Description

An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality. An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user to open or otherwise) to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory information that could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
