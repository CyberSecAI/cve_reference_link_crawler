- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formWriteFacMac` function in the `httpd` binary of the Tenda AC9 router takes the "mac" parameter from a POST request and passes it to the `doSystemCmd` function without any validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection. The lack of input sanitization on the "mac" parameter allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute OS commands with root privileges on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/WriteFacMac` endpoint via the web interface. The malicious payload is placed inside the "mac" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the web interface.
