For long I have been wondering how to get such a professional look timer for our landing pages. Thank you guys for this great work. My search for wordPress countdown timers ends here.

After opening a ticket reg. a bug and some quite fast conversation and additional testing now it is calculating in the correct way.
My own investigations showed that it is more a weird implementation in php itself which makes it quite challenging to calculate the correct time based on timezones, DST and so on.
However, it is doing what it is supposed to do and it is not common that a free version has so many many designs without any ads.
Only the documentation should be reworked and finetuned. (Give me a hint if i could help)

I will keep using the older, no longer supported version. Since it works better than this version!

I downloaded this plugin, ticked the options in the settings to hide years, months and weeks, but these still appear on any timer I create. Absolutely useless

Works great on my climate-change doomsday countdown page – “The world will end in 12 years” (Presumably on April 1, 2031). Save us AOC! Seriously, this plugin is easy breezy and does just what it says. Bonus – shortcode works just like the legacy version. Delete the old, install the new – that’s all there was to it for me. Favorited.
