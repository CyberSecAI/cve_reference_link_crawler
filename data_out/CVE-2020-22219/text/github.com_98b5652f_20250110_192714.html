Yeah, you can run `fuzzer_encoder crash-fuzzer_encoder` to reproduce(source code is oss-fuzz/fuzz-encoder.cc), as i have already mentioned before. |

| [@ltx2018](https://github.com/ltx2018) I've tried to reproduce this, but I seem to be bumping into [this problem with clang/LLVM](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=945073), which prevents me from building fuzzer\_encoder on a 32-bit system.  Anyway, I have a hunch about what might be triggering the problem. Would you mind checking whether PR [#252](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/252) solves this problem? I know [#214](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/214) should already fix the problem, but I think [#252](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/252) might be fixing the root cause. Please let me know. |

| I think the analysis of [CVE-2020-22219](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hvp4-qmrj-gvhf "CVE-2020-22219") is wrong. The vulnerability described in [CVE-2020-22219](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hvp4-qmrj-gvhf "CVE-2020-22219") is in libFLAC. However, this vulnerability is only exploitable when the program calling the library does not fulfill a key requirement of the library API: the calling program has to supply values that are out-of-bounds. This requirement is mentioned [here](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__stream__encoder.html#ga7453fc29d7e86b499f23b1adfba98da1), [here](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__stream__encoder.html#ga87b9c361292da5c5928a8fb5fda7c423) and [here](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__stream__encoder.html#ga6e31c221f7e23345267c52f53c046c24).  This means that there is no way to exploit the vulnerability through the flac command line tool that is provided by the project: it does not violate this requirement, it only supplies values that are within bounds.  So, the vulnerability is only exploitable with a program calling libFLAC that is does not properly check whether inputs are bounded or not. That seems a pretty important omission in the current analysis. |

| On second thought, there is another way to exploit this, but that is very unreliable: when running out of memory. As FLAC uses only a tiny amount of memory and the failing realloc only allocates a small amount of memory, this is probably hard to turn into an exploit.  In short, this buffer overflow only happens after an unhandled memory allocation failure. |

| Doesn't the attacker control how much memory will the encoder need? With flac it causes a double free, but I guess other applications might do something with the encoder after the reallocation failed. |

| No, the encoding parameters bound how much memory is used, so an attacker cannot let libFLAC use an arbitrary amount of memory, except when the program allows for supplying invalid data. The problem here was that invalid input made the encoder go beyond those bounds. That is why [#273](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/273) adds an explicit check that input is valid, [#252](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/252) added a limit to the bitwriter size (which was increased in [#378](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/378)) and [#419](https://github.com/xiph/flac/pull/419) fixed handling of the allocation failure. |
