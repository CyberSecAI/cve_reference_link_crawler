The content relates to CVE-2024-33124.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wang.miansen.roothub.modules.node.controller.admin.NodeAdminController: java.lang.String parentNode()` function in Roothub does not properly filter the `nodeTitle` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists because the `nodeTitle` parameter flows into `nodeService.pageForAdmin()` and `listForAdmin` function in `nodeDao.xml` without sufficient sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `parentNode()` function in the `NodeAdminController`, by manipulating the `nodeTitle` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected endpoint, specifically the `parentNode()` function within the `NodeAdminController` and have the ability to inject SQL statements through the `nodeTitle` parameter.
