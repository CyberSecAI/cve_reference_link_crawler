The provided content describes a vulnerability in inxedu v2.0.6 that allows for arbitrary file upload.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `com.inxedu.os.common.controller.ImageUploadController#gok4` function where the file extension check is insufficient. Although the code restricts uploading files with a `jsp` extension, the `fileType` parameter can be manipulated to include `jspx`, thereby bypassing this restriction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure file extension validation: The code checks for `jsp` extensions but can be bypassed by using `jspx`.
    - Parameter manipulation: The `fileType` parameter, which dictates allowed extensions, can be modified by the attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload a malicious `jspx` file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can result in complete server compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `/image/gok4` endpoint.
    - The request includes a multipart/form-data payload with the malicious `jspx` file.
    - The `fileType` parameter in the request is manipulated to include `jspx`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    - The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the correct URL of the file upload function.
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP request parameters.
    - The attacker must be able to authenticate into the admin panel (admin/111111).
