The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Intel IGB Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root Cause:** The igb driver incorrectly calculates buffer sizes when handling large `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` values. Specifically, it does not properly account for the size of shared information when selecting the ring layout. This causes the driver to attempt to fit two packets within a single 4KB page, leading to the first fragment list overwriting the second packet's head.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect buffer size calculation in the `igb_set_rx_buffer_len` function.
- Failure to consider shared info size when selecting ring layouts.
- Vulnerability to memory corruption when `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` is set to a high value, leading to packets overlapping in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Payload corruption on Transmission (TX).
- Data corruption, potentially leading to system instability or unexpected behavior.
- In the reported case, SSH connections failed due to the data corruption

**Attack Vectors:**
- Setting the `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` kernel parameter to a large value (e.g., 45).
- Triggering network traffic through the IGB interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control kernel parameters (requires root or `CAP_SYS_MODULE` capability).
- Ability to generate network traffic through the affected interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` is set to 45, while it works correctly when set to 17.
- The fix involves checking if 2KB buffers are insufficient. This is achieved by adding the `IGB_2K_TOO_SMALL_WITH_PADDING` check within the `igb_set_rx_buffer_len` function and setting the `set_ring_uses_large_buffer` flag which utilizes larger buffers.
- The issue was reported in Red Hat Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320).
- The fix is associated with the commit `8aba27c4a5020abdf60149239198297f88338a8d`.
- The fix was backported to stable kernels via commits `b52bd8bcb9e8ff250c79b44f9af8b15cae8911ab` and `8ea80ff5d8298356d28077bc30913ed37df65109`.
- The fix targets the function `igb_set_rx_buffer_len` in `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c`.
