The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins, including CVE-2022-28141.

**CVE-2022-28141**

*   **Root cause:** The Proxmox plugin stores the Proxmox Datacenter password in plain text in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Password stored in plain text.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted Proxmox Datacenter password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Proxmox environment.
*   **Attack vectors:** Requires access to the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have access to the Jenkins controller file system to read the `config.xml` file.

This vulnerability is fixed in Proxmox Plugin version 0.6.0, where the password is stored encrypted once the plugin's configuration is saved.
