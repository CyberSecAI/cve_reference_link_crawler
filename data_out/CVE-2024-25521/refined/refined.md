    "CVE-2024-25521": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "SQL Injection",
        "details": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present due to direct concatenation of user-supplied input from `Request.QueryString` into SQL queries. This occurs in various .aspx files throughout the application, including but not limited to `plan_template_preview.aspx`, `bulletin_template_show.aspx`, `wf_file_download.aspx`, `address_public_show.aspx`, `address_public_new.aspx`, `kaizen_download.aspx`, `AttachDownLoad.aspx`, `AttachDown.aspx`, `wf_work_finish_file_down.aspx`, `wf_template_child_field_list.aspx`, `sys_blogtemplate_new.aspx`, `MF.aspx`, `wf_work_print.aspx`, `wf_get_fields_approve.aspx`, `wf_work_form_save.aspx`, `WorkPlanAttachDownLoad.aspx`, `file_memo.aspx`, `get_company.aspx`, `worklog_template_show.aspx`, `pm_gatt_inc.aspx`, `OfficeFileDownload.aspx`, `wf_work_stat_setting.aspx`, `wf_office_file_history_show.aspx`, `SearchCondiction.aspx`, `get_find_condiction.aspx`, and `get_dict.aspx`.",
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. An attacker might also be able to use SQL injection to bypass authentication or gain access to sensitive information.",
         "attack_vector": "HTTP GET/POST requests to vulnerable .aspx pages with malicious SQL code in parameters such as `template_id`, `id`, `sys_file_storage_id`, `attach_id`, `email_attach_id`, `contentid`, `file_id`, `table`, `idlist`, `filename`, `project_id`, `PageID`, `bt_id`, `txt_keyword` and other affected parameters.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is needed for most of the reported SQL injection vulnerabilities (unauthorized access in frontend)."
      },
        {
          "vulnerability": "Information Disclosure",
          "details": "Error messages reveal physical paths of the website. This can be used as a secondary attack vector if there are other vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection.",
          "impact": "This can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain shell access to the underlying OS, allowing for further exploitation and system compromise.",
           "attack_vector": "By sending requests to certain pages that result in error messages, an attacker could see the full physical path of the website. Specific vulnerable pages are `OfficeFileUpdate.aspx` and `asset_file_search_left.aspx`.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
        },
        {
          "vulnerability": "Unauthorized Access",
           "details": "The `AttachDown.aspx` page and its ability to download different file types through iterating over the contentid or email_attach_id parameter presents an unauthorized access issue.",
          "impact": "An attacker could download arbitrary files from the system without proper authorization.",
           "attack_vector": "By sending HTTP GET requests to the `AttachDown.aspx` page, an attacker could access files by providing an arbitrary `contentid` or `email_attach_id`.",
           "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
        },
        {
          "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "details": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present due to improper handling of user input in parameters such as `PageTitle` and `template_name` and `AutoPrint` where these parameters are reflected back into the page without proper encoding or sanitization. Specific vulnerable pages are `emailset_outside.aspx`, `common_new_top.aspx`, `common_show.aspx`, `common_show_top.aspx`, `common_deal.aspx`, `common_deal_top.aspx`, and `wf_work_print.aspx`.",
          "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable pages, allowing them to execute arbitrary code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
           "attack_vector": "An attacker would craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads in the `PageTitle`, `template_name`, or `AutoPrint` parameters.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, and any user who access the malicious URL would become a victim."
        },
         {
          "vulnerability": "System Design Flaw",
          "details": "The `dSql.aspx` page allows for generation of sql backup scripts and access to log files by date.",
          "impact": "An attacker could gain information about the database by generating and accessing these files. The system might also expose internal file structure.",
           "attack_vector": "An attacker would send an HTTP GET request to the `dSql.aspx` page to generate the backup scripts, or by directly accessing log files such as `/logfiles/20240112.txt`.",
          "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
