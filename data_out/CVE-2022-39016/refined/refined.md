Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39016:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Javascript injection vulnerability within the PDFtron component used in M-Files Hubshare. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when processing PDF files, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Javascript Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into PDF files which is then executed when the PDF is viewed using the vulnerable PDFtron component within M-Files Hubshare.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the form of PDF files, which enables the injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** A successful exploit can lead to account takeover, meaning the attacker gains control of the victim's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PDF Upload:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction**: When a user views the malicious PDF using the vulnerable PDFtron component within M-Files Hubshare, the injected Javascript code is executed within the user's browser context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of M-Files Hubshare. This means they need to have a valid account to be able to upload files.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by Michael Newton on behalf of The Missing Link Security
- The vulnerability was found in M-Files Hubshare version 3.3.1.6
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.10.9
