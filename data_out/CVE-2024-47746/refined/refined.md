Based on the provided information, this commit fixes a bug in the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation. Specifically, it addresses an issue related to locking when the `FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE` flag is set.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The code incorrectly used shared locks instead of exclusive locks when `FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE` was enabled.
- According to the comment, shared locks are not allowed when parallel page cache I/O is enabled.
- This incorrect usage of shared lock would cause the wait in `fuse_file_cached_io_open` to go on forever, leading to a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Locking:** The primary weakness was using a shared lock in a situation where an exclusive lock was required, leading to a potential deadlock.
- **Potential Deadlock:** The incorrect locking could lead to a deadlock condition if multiple operations try to acquire the shared lock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  A deadlock in the FUSE filesystem can effectively make the affected filesystem unresponsive, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user-space FUSE filesystem implementation could trigger this condition by enabling `FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE` and performing operations that would acquire the lock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to mount a FUSE filesystem and control its behavior, specifically setting the `FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE` flag and triggering the vulnerable code path in the kernel.

**Technical Details:**
- The patch modifies `fs/fuse/file.c` to return `true` in the `fuse_dio_wr_exclusive_lock` function when `FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE` is set, which causes it to acquire an exclusive lock.
- The commit message references the commit that introduced the issue: `205c1d802683 ("fuse: allow parallel dio writes with FUSE_DIRECT_IO_ALLOW_MMAP")`
- The commit message clearly states that the previous implementation may have been a typo, and that shared locks are not allowed with this bit set.
