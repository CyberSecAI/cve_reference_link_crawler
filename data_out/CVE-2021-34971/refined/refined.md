  "CVE-2021-34971": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CNA": "Foxit",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during parsing of PDF files.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Opening a malicious PDF file",
        "Visiting a malicious web page"
     ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or a malicious website with a specific JPEG2000 image, and the victim needs to interact with this crafted document or website, for example, by opening the malicious PDF document or browsing the malicious webpage."
