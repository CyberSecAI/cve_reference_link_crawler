Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL Injection vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or filtering in the "Parâmetros" field of the "Consulta/Executa" functionality within the MHA Systems application. User-supplied input is directly included in the SQL query without validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **System Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the "Consulta/Executa" functionality of the web application. Specifically, the "Parâmetros" fields, which are not properly sanitized.
*   **Direct SQL Query Modification:** By injecting SQL code into the parameters, attackers can modify the intended SQL query to perform unauthorized actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the web application and the "Consulta/Executa" interface.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Error-Based SQLi:** The initial exploitation is error-based; the application returns errors revealing database details and allowing for further injection.
*   **Blind SQLi:** Time-based blind SQLi was also identified using SQLMAP, indicating that even without direct error feedback, the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   **Automated Exploitation:** The content details the use of SQLMAP for automation of the exploitation process which included dumping of the database tables.
*   **Real-World Example:** The content gives a specific example of a SQLi attack in a "Consulta/Executa" function with multiple "Parametros" fields. It starts with basic single quote injection testing, then moves to UNION based injections and then exploitation with SQLMAP.
