- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the Spectra Pro plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs by injecting malicious scripts via block IDs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject the malicious scripts.
