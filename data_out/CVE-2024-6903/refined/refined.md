Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `sort1_user.php` file within the Record Management System. Specifically, the `position` parameter received via a POST request is directly used in an SQL query without any form of escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the user-supplied `position` parameter in the SQL query:
  ```php
  $position=$_POST['position'];
  $name_query=mysqli_query($conn,"select * from position where position='$position'")or die(mysqli_error());
  ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can potentially bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive data from the database (customer information, personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property, etc.) by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can also modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `sort1_user.php` file. The `position` parameter is used to inject SQL payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application to send malicious requests.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP POST requests and manipulate parameters.
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft payloads that can extract or manipulate data.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was tested using the sqlmap tool, which confirmed the presence of boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerable parameter is `position`.
- The vulnerable page is `sort1_user.php`.
- The product affected is SourceCodester Record Management System V1.0.
