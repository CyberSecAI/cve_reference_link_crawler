- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Resilient platform supports TLS 1.2 ciphers that are not enabled for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of TLS 1.2 ciphers without Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). This allows for decryption of recorded traffic if the server's private key is compromised.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who has recorded encrypted traffic and later obtains the server's key could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to eavesdrop on the encrypted network traffic and later obtain the server's private key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to record network traffic and later gain access to the server's private key.
