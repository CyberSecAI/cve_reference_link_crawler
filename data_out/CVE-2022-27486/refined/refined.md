Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `execute` CLI commands of FortiDDoS and FortiDDoS-F. This leads to an OS Command Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-78 (OS Command Injection):** The core vulnerability is that the system allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
- **CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements):** The input sanitization or validation is inadequate, failing to prevent the injection of special characters or commands into the OS command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands as `root`.
- This allows the attacker full control over the system, potentially leading to complete compromise.
- The attacker could perform actions such as data theft, denial of service, and installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the CLI interface.
- An authenticated user with the necessary privileges to access the `execute` command can inject malicious OS commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log in to the FortiDDoS or FortiDDoS-F device via the CLI.
- **Privilege:** The authenticated user needs sufficient privileges to use the `execute` command.
- **Local access:** Although not explicitly stated, given the CVSS vector, this seems to imply local access.

**Affected Products/Versions:**

The vulnerability affects a wide range of FortiDDoS and FortiDDoS-F versions:
- FortiDDoS 5.7 (5.7.0)
- FortiDDoS 5.6 (5.6.0 through 5.6.1)
- FortiDDoS 5.5 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 5.4 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 5.3 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 5.2 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 5.1 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 5.0 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 4.7 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 4.6 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS 4.5 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS-F 6.5 (6.5.0)
- FortiDDoS-F 6.4 (6.4.0 through 6.4.1)
- FortiDDoS-F 6.3 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS-F 6.2 (all versions)
- FortiDDoS-F 6.1 (all versions)

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the specified fixed versions.
- For versions without a fix, migrate to a supported, patched release.

**CVSS Score:**
- The CVSSv3 score is 6.0, which is rated as a medium severity.
- The CVSS vector is `AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C`.
