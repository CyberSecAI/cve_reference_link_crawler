## Description

MSI Afterburner v4.6.6.16381 Beta 3 is vulnerable to
an ACL Bypass vulnerability in the `RTCore64.sys` driver,
which leads to triggering vulnerabilities like
[CVE-2024-1443](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1443)
and
[CVE-2024-1460](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1460)
from a low privileged user.

## Vulnerability

The `RTCore64.sys` driver allows to perform any IOCTL
operation from a low privileged user.

The creation of the `DeviceObject` is done using the
following code:

```
RtlInitUnicodeString(&DefaultSDDLString, L"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)");
  result = WdmlibIoCreateDeviceSecure(
             DriverObject,
             0,
             &DestinationString,
             0x22u,
             0,
             0,
             &DefaultSDDLString,
             0i64,
             &DeviceObject);

```

According to [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdmsec/nf-wdmsec-wdmlibiocreatedevicesecure),
the function signature is:

```
NTSTATUS WdmlibIoCreateDeviceSecure(
  [in]           PDRIVER_OBJECT   DriverObject,
  [in]           ULONG            DeviceExtensionSize,
  [in, optional] PUNICODE_STRING  DeviceName,
  [in]           DEVICE_TYPE      DeviceType,
  [in]           ULONG            DeviceCharacteristics,
  [in]           BOOLEAN          Exclusive,
  [in]           PCUNICODE_STRING DefaultSDDLString,
  [in, optional] LPCGUID          DeviceClassGuid,
                 PDEVICE_OBJECT   *DeviceObject
);

```

The defined SDDL string limits the access for the
`DeviceObject` to Administrators only:

```
PS C:\Users\aroldan> ConvertFrom-SddlString "D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)" | select -ExpandProperty DiscretionaryAcl
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM: AccessAllowed (GenericAll)
BUILTIN\Administrators: AccessAllowed (GenericAll)
PS C:\Users\aroldan>

```

Every `DeviceObject` has an associated name space, which
means that paths like `\Device\DeviceName` and
`\Device\DeviceName\Anything` would be valid targets for
a IOCTL request. However, as the `DeviceCharacteristics`
option is set to `NULL` when creating the `DeviceObject`,
the defined ACL does not propagate to every possible file
under the `DeviceObject` namespace, making it trivial to
bypass the ACL by simply adding a `\` in the end of the
`DeviceName` definition in the IOCTL request:

```
PS C:\Users\admin\Desktop> whoami
desktop-fm7vnok\admin
PS C:\Users\admin\Desktop> whoami /priv

   > I've been contacted by Andres Roldan @ fluidattacks, the same researcher who posted CVE quoted above. He discovered one more issue inside the driver, and this time it is not an intended functionality, so I'd definitively like to patch it. He found the way to bypass MSI AB driver's ACL and access driver's functionality from non-admin processes. I've already patched it a few weeks ago, but it took some time to get driver signed on MSI side. So new beta with it will be available shortly.

   > Then those guys from EA anticheat team whitelisted old 7.3.5 digital signature only (which is no longer valid to sign anything) and forgot to whitelist a signature used to sign 7.3.6 and newer builds. Typical EA, why I'm not surprized.

   > Rolling back to 7.3.5 because of that like linked twitter post is suggesting is just plain stupid. 7.3.6 fixes important things.

   > > [CVE - CVE-2024-1460 (mitre.org)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1460) associated with MSI Afterburner's driver has been published. It is [described as](https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/mingus/):

   > > "The 0x80002040 IOCTL code of the RTCore64.sys driver allows map up to 0x20000 of a physical address from range 0xC0000 to 0xE0000 on a non-paged virtual kernel memory range whose address can be leaked. That physical range is commonly used to store BIOS information of the device's motherboard. The handle to the driver can only be obtained from a high integrity process."

   >
   >
   > I've been contacted by Andres Roldan @ fluidattacks, the same researcher who posted CVE quoted above. He discovered one more issue inside the driver, and this time it is not an intended functionality, so I'd definitively like to patch it. He found the way to bypass MSI AB driver's ACL and access driver's functionality from non-admin processes. I've already patched it a few weeks ago, but it took some time to get driver signed on MSI side. So new beta with it will be available shortly.

   > We're uploading RTSS 7.3.7 beta 3 Build 28022 and MSI AB 4.6.6 Beta 4 Build 16449 (includes RTSS 7.3.7 beta 3) with a fix for ACL bypass vulnerability mentioned in the previous post. Both MSI AB and RTSS got new [Bulgarian localization](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/msi-afterburner-translation-and-skins-for-brazilian-portuguese-pt-br.404087/page-2#post-6226921) by [@didopioneer](https://forums.guru3d.com/members/305258/). Also MSI AB got a few changes mentioned in the previous posts ([#1](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/msi-ab-rtss-development-news-thread.412822/page-223#post-6219983) [#2](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/msi-ab-rtss-development-news-thread.412822/page-223#post-6220109)), I'll summarize them a bit later.

   > As I promised before, here is full changes list for recently released betas:
   >
   >  **RTSS 7.3.7 beta 3 Build 28022:**
   >
   >
   >
   > - Added Bulgarian localization
   >
   > - Fixed ACL bypass vulnerability in OverlayEditor's RTCoreMini driver
   >
   >
   >
   > **MSI Afterburner 4.6.6 Beta 4 Build 16449:**
   >
   >
   >
   > - Added [alternate V/F point locking mode](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/msi-ab-rtss-development-news-thread.412822/page-223#post-6219983). Now you may consequently press <L> key inside V/F curve editor to switch between voltage locking and max frequency locking modes
   >
   > - Optimized GPU context switching implementation in HAL. This provides slightly faster GPU selection in GUI and slightly reduced CPU polling time for the systems with multiple GPUs
   >
   > - Now MSI Afterburner uses extended 32KB RTSS text slot instead of previously used 4KB slot to display OSD, so legacy MSI Afterburner OSD can fit 8x more text items without hitting the limit
   >
   > - Added Bulgarian localization
   >
   > - Fixed ACL bypass vulnerability and [NULL ptr dereference](https://fluidattacks.com/advisories/coltrane/) in RTCore driver (reported by Andres Roldan)
   >
   > - Bundled RTSS version has been upgraded to 7.3.7 beta 3
