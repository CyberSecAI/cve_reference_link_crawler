Specifically, the applications use user-controlled input to specify the file path that the `send_file` function reads, leading to path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is an **absolute path traversal** (CWE-22) vulnerability. The `flask.send_file` function is intended to serve files from a designated directory. However, by providing crafted input (absolute paths or relative paths that navigate outside the intended directory), an attacker can access and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read any file on the server filesystem that the application user has access to. This includes application source code, configuration files, credentials, and other sensitive data. This can lead to full information disclosure and potentially further exploitation if sensitive keys or passwords are accessed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through network requests to the vulnerable application's endpoints, where an attacker can inject a malicious file path into the request parameters. This can be done using a web browser, command-line tools like `curl`, or any other method to craft HTTP requests.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. They do not require any authentication or special privileges. They are able to exploit the vulnerability by crafting the request that will be sent to the server.

**Key Observations**
*   All of these vulnerabilities stem from a common mistake: not properly sanitizing user input before using it in file path operations, particularly with Flask's `send_file` function.
*   The CVSS scores are consistent across most, indicating a high severity (9.3 or 8.6) due to potential for full information disclosure and low complexity of exploitation.
*   The EPSS scores are relatively low, which may reflect the fact that these are specific vulnerabilities in individual github repos that may not be widely deployed. The highest EPSS score was `0.295` (69th percentile) and the lowest was `0.144` (51st percentile).
