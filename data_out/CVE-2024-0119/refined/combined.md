# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-2015

## NVIDIA D3D10 Driver Shader Functionality MOV instruction out-of-bounds read vulnerability

##### October 23, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-0119

##### SUMMARY

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Shader Functionality functionality of NVIDIA D3D10 Driver 555.99, 32.0.15.5599. A specially crafted executable / shader file can lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

NVIDIA D3D10 Driver 555.99, 32.0.15.5599

##### PRODUCT URLS

NVIDIA D3D10 Driver - <https://nvidia.com>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-125 - Out-of-bounds Read

##### DETAILS

This vulnerability potentially could be triggered from guest machines running virtualization environments (ie. VMware, qemu, VirtualBox etc.) in order to perform guest-to-host escape - as it was demonstrated before (TALOS-2018-0533, TALOS-2018-0568, etc.). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly). We were able to trigger this vulnerability from HYPER-V guest using RemoteFX feature leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). While the RemoteFX was recently depracated by Microsoft some older machines may still use this software.

To trigger the bug we have modified and corrupted the shaderbyte code coresponding to the “MOV” instruction
This leads to out-of-bounds memory read situation:

```
00007FF9EDACC63E | 4D:8B46 20               | mov r8,qword ptr ds:[r14+20]            |
00007FF9EDACC642 | 41:8BC1                  | mov eax,r9d                             |
00007FF9EDACC645 | 41:0FB78C40 14120000     | movzx ecx,word ptr ds:[r8+rax*2+1214]   |

```

The source memory address is computed from the shader bytecode (the RAX register contains the value taken directly from the shader bytecode). Attacker can modify the shaderbyte code in order to force the nvwgf2umx.dll to read arbitrary memory region.

```
    First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
    This exception may be expected and handled.
