- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially execute actions that are intended for users with higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is in the WordPress plugin "Happy Addons for Elementor". It can be exploited by sending a request to a function lacking proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with 'Contributor' role (or potentially lower) on the WordPress site.
