- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `urvpn_client` binary in Milesight UR32L routers does not properly validate the server's SSL certificate when establishing a VPN connection to the Milesight VPN software. Specifically, the `init_SSL_context` function does not use `SSL_CTX_set_verify` or any other options to verify peer certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper certificate validation (CWE-295). The client does not verify the certificate provided by the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can be performed. Although not explicitly stated, an attacker could potentially gain access to the VPN connection, enabling the interception of data and possibly leading to further compromise. The summary mentions increased privileges, which suggests that successful exploitation could lead to a compromise beyond simple data interception.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker intercepts the communication between the router and the Milesight VPN server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Milesight UR32L router and the VPN server it's connecting to.
