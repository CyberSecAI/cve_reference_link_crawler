Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2023-34423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts that are later executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user logged into the WordPress website with administrative privileges. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking and privilege escalation
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Theft of sensitive data
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to inject malicious code into the plugin, which is later stored in the database. This could be through various input fields or settings provided by the plugin.
- The malicious script is then triggered when a user (especially an administrator) views a page containing the injected code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by inserting malicious scripts into the pluginâ€™s data through forms or settings, without needing prior access or privileges to the system. The victim will need to access a page on the target website where the malicious code is rendered.

**Additional Details:**

- The identified vulnerable version of the plugin is prior to 3.6.4.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1, classified as medium severity.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3, classified as medium severity.
