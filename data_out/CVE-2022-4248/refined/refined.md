- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly substitutes a user-controlled `$id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, in the `editBooking.php` file, the `$id` parameter from a POST request is used in lines 17-19 for a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization. The application directly uses user input in SQL queries, which allows an attacker to manipulate the queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the possibility of introducing time delays via `sleep()` calls.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `editBooking.php` page, where the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to `editBooking.php` and modify the `id` parameter in the query string to inject malicious SQL code.
