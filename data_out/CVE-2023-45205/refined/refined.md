- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected application (SICAM PAS/PQS) is installed with specific files and folders that have insecure permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment for critical resources (CWE-732)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, exploiting the insecure permissions of application files and folders.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated locally on the system where SICAM PAS/PQS is installed.
