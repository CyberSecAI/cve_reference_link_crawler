Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of CVAT users to specify custom endpoint URLs for cloud storage, specifically Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. The application does not adequately restrict the provided URLs, allowing users to specify internal IP addresses or domain names, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and filtering of user-supplied URLs for cloud storage endpoints. This allows an attacker to make the CVAT backend initiate requests to arbitrary internal network resources.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** If an internal server is accessible without authentication or with credentials known to the attacker, this can enable the attacker to interact with the internal server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with a CVAT account can:
1. **Probe Internal Network:** Scan the internal network where the CVAT backend runs, potentially identifying running services.
2. **Access Internal Servers:** If an internal server has a compatible API and allows access (anonymous or with known credentials), the attacker can:
    - **List Files:** Enumerate files on the internal server.
    - **Extract Files:** Download files from the server, particularly if those files are compatible with CVAT's reading capabilities (e.g. images, videos, annotations, backups).
    - **Overwrite Files:** Upload data to the server by exporting data from CVAT, potentially overwriting existing resources on that internal server.
The severity and impact depend on the internal server's configurations and the information stored on them.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. The attacker exploits this vulnerability through the CVAT web application by providing malicious custom endpoint URLs through the cloud storage configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid account on the CVAT platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to configure cloud storage integrations in CVAT.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of internal network infrastructure that CVAT is deployed on to identify targets.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves routing S3 and Azure requests through a smokescreen proxy, which will prohibit access to intranet IP addresses by default.
- The affected versions are CVAT 2.1.0 through 2.14.2.
- The patched version is CVAT 2.14.3.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.1.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery)
