### Description

The Podlove Podcast Publisher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the init\_download() and init() functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.11. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export the plugin's tracking data and podcast information.
