Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-28400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insufficient resource management in the affected Siemens PROFINET devices when handling PROFINET Discovery and Configuration Protocol (DCP) reset packets. Specifically, the devices do not limit or throttle the allocation of resources when processing these packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770):** The core vulnerability lies in the affected devices' inability to manage resource allocation effectively when handling a large number of DCP reset packets, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition. An attacker can render the affected device unresponsive by sending a large amount of specially crafted DCP reset packets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending malicious packets over the network.
*   **PROFINET Discovery and Configuration Protocol (DCP):** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by exploiting the DCP reset functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any prior access to the device to exploit the vulnerability. They only need network connectivity to the targeted device.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low, indicating that the exploit is relatively easy to perform.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects a wide range of Siemens products, primarily those implementing PROFINET, including:
    *   SIMATIC PROFINET Driver
    *   SIMATIC NET communication modules (CM 1542-1) and CP cards
    *   SCALANCE network switches and routers (X, M, W, etc. series)
    *   RUGGEDCOM RM1224 routers
    *   Development/Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO
    *   SIMATIC S7-1200 CPUs
    *   SIMOCODE proV devices
    *   SOFTNET-IE PNIO software
    *   SIMATIC MV500 family
    *   SIMATIC Power Line Booster PLB
*   **Mitigation:** Siemens provides firmware updates for many of the affected products.
    *   For some devices, no fixes are planned but workarounds are suggested.
    *   Workarounds include: blocking incoming DCP reset packets from untrusted networks, and disabling PROFINET where it's not needed.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 and a CVSS v4 base score of 8.7, both indicating a high severity.
*   **No Public Exploits:** At the time of the advisory, there were no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-28400 describes a remotely exploitable DoS vulnerability in numerous Siemens PROFINET devices. An attacker can send a large number of DCP reset packets and cause the device to become unresponsive.
