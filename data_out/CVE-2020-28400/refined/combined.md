Siemens has also identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Block incoming PROFINET Discovery and Configuration Protocol (PCP) packets (Ethertype 0x8892, Frame-ID: 0xfefe) from untrusted networks.
* Disable PROFINET in products, where PROFINET is optional and not used in the environment.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security](http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/en/109749989), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information about this vulnerability and the associated remediations, please see Siemens publication number [SSA-599968](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-599968.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block incoming Profinet Discovery and Configuration Protocol (DCP) packets (Ethertype 0x8892,

Frame-ID: 0xfefe) from untrusted networks

• Disable Profinet in products, where Profinet is optional and not used in your environment

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

The SIPLUS HCS 4x00 heating control system is used to control and switch heaters in industry control
und operation e.g. quartz, ceramic, flash, halogen or infrared heaters.

The SOFTNET product family includes several software applications for connecting programming devices
to Industrial Ethernet and PROFIBUS.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28400

Affected devices contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial of
service condition. The vulnerability can be triggered if a large amount of DCP reset packets are sent to
the device.

SSA-599968: Denial of Service Vulnerability in Profinet Devices

| Publication Date: | 2021-07-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.8 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Block incoming Profinet Discovery and Configuration Protocol (DCP) packets (Ethertype 0x8892, Frame-ID: 0xfefe) from untrusted networks
* Disable Profinet in products, where Profinet is optional and not used in your environment

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>
