## Description

Breeze is a free, simple (yet powerful) and user-friendly WordPress Caching Plugin developed by the Cloudways team. It offers various options to optimize WordPress performance at various levels. It works equally great with WordPress, WordPress with WooCommerce and WordPress Multisite.

Breeze excels in the following areas:

* **Performance:** Breeze improves website speed and resource optimization. Other features include file level cache system, database cleanup, minification, support for Varnish cache and simplified CDN integration options.
* **Convenience:** Breeze is easy to install and configure directly from WordPress. Configuring Breeze is easy and most of the default options work well right out of the box. The recommended settings should work on all your WordPress websites seamlessly.
* **Simplicity:** Breeze is designed to be simple for all users. Just install and activate the plugin and you’ll see the results instantaneously.

What makes Breeze WordPress Cache Plugin awesome is that it comes with builtin support for Varnish. If Varnish is not installed on your servers, Breeze will utilize its internal cache mechanism to boost up your WordPress site performance.

**FEATURES**

* Seamless integration with Varnish Cache for efficient content delivery. No manual adjustments needed – all settings come pre-configured for your convenience.
* Optimize performance using Cloudflare’s caching capabilities. No specific Breeze configurations are needed – it works out of the box.
* Effortlessly integrate your preferred Content Delivery Network (CDN) for global content distribution with Breeze instead of using the the CDN providers’ plugins.
* Trim WordPress database bloat effortlessly. Breeze’s Database Options optimize and declutter your database, boosting performance by removing unneeded data like post revisions and trashed content.
* Take command over caching exclusions. With Breeze, you have the power to prevent specific URLs, JS files, and CSS files from being cached.
* Achieve smaller page sizes and faster load times through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript minification, including inline CSS and JavaScript minification.
* Load images when they’re visible, not all at once, for faster webpage performance by implementing lazy loading for images.
* Load JS files with deferred loading, enhancing overall performance.
* Supercharge your site’s speed with Breeze’s advanced preloading features: load fonts early, quicken link clicks, and enhance DNS requests for a seamless user experience.
* Master real-time interactions with Breeze’s Heartbeat API management. Fine-tune notifications, sales data, autosaves, and more to optimize WordPress performance by adjusting API call frequencies.
* Effortlessly manage Breeze settings using Import/Export. Download your configurations as a .json file for backup, or effortlessly import existing settings to quickly fine-tune your optimization.

**Support:** We love to provide support! Post your questions on the WordPress.org support forums, or if you are a Cloudways Customer you may ask questions on the [Cloudways Community Forum](https://community.cloudways.com/).

### Does Breeze support Varnish and to what extent?

Breeze, by default, supports Varnish. It has been tested to be fully compatible with Cloudways Servers that come with Varnish pre-installed. If you are using hosting providers other than Cloudways, we suggest you confirm Varnish support with your hosting provider

### Does Breeze support WooCommerce?

Breeze is fully compatible with WooCommerce, out of the box. It does not require any special configurations.

### Does Breeze support WordPress Multisite?

Breeze is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite without the need for any extra configuration.

### How does Breeze handle WordPress multisite?

Breeze handles all WordPress multisite instances globally. All the settings for multisite are now handled on the network level.

### Is Breeze compatible with other WordPress Cache plugins?

We DO NOT recommend using two WordPress cache plugins at the same time on any WordPress website.

We strongly recommend that you use Breeze as the only cache plugin for your website. If there are any other cache plugins installed, please ensure that you have disabled them prior to proceeding with the Breeze installation.

### Is Breeze compatible with HTTPS?

Breeze does not require any special configuration to work with HTTP or HTTPS pages.

### Does Breeze have compatibility issues with other known plugins?

Breeze has been tested with popular plugins available on WordPress.org. Please feel free to report any incompatibilities on the WordPress Support Forums or on [Cloudways Community Forum](https://community.cloudways.com/).

### Does Breeze support CDN?

Breeze supports CDN integration. It allows all static assets (such as images, CSS and JS files) to be served via CDN.

### What does Breeze’s Database Optimization feature do?

WordPress databases are notorious for storing information like post revisions, spam comments and much more. Over time, databases l become bloated and it is a good practice to clear out unwanted information to reduce database size and improve optimization.

Breeze’s database optimization cleans out unwanted information in a single click.

### Will comments and other dynamic parts of my blog appear immediately?

Comments will appear upon moderation as per the comment system (or policy) set in place by the blog owner. Other dynamic changes such as any modifications in files will require a full cache purge.

### Can I exclude URLs of individual files and pages from cache?

You can exclude a file by mentioning its URL or file type (by mentioning file extension) in the exclude fields (available in the Breeze settings). Exclude will not let the cache impact that URL or file type.

If Varnish is active, you will need to exclude URLs and file type(s) in the Varnish configuration. If you are hosting WordPress websites on Cloudways servers, follow [this KB to exclude URLs from the Varnish cache](https://support.cloudways.com/how-to-exclude-url-from-varnish/).

### Does it work with all hosting providers?

Breeze has been tested to work with all major hosting providers. In addition, major Breeze options such as Gzip, browser cache, minification, grouping, database optimization. CDN integration will work as expected on all hosting providers.

Not bad, but you have to add the next features, without it, it’s just another cache plugin.
Remove unused css!!!
Better support to CDN with exclude / include custom directory and files
And maybe, checking the plugin performance when the minify option is enabled.
Thanks

I get burned constantly when I update Breeze. And, it’s on different sites with different plugins. Breeze affects multiple plugins, and in some cases it is only is certain situations, so it is impossible to test for every situation where Breeze screws up stuff.

Excellent work from the Cloudways team, as the plugin works perfectly with sites that are also outside the server. It’s the only one that worked correctly on a client in conjunction with varnish and CDN. Great work!

I use Cloudways for multiple client websites and their hosting is excellent. But their default Breeze cache plugin is nothing but issues, and inconsistent ones at that.
On one site the WP admin dashboard would simply be a blank screen, even though we could access the rest of the admin areas. On another site Breeze totally messed up the layout.
Deactivating this plugin now on all sites and going with a different cache plugin. Don’t recommend using this.

Easy to install and configure, it offers an intuitive interface for managing cache, optimizing files, and integrating with CDNs. With significant improvements in load times and PageSpeed scores, Breeze makes a noticeable difference. Its compatibility with Varnish Cache is a bonus for Cloudways users. Highly recommended for a seamless and efficient caching solution!
