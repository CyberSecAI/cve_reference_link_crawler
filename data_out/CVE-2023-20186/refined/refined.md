- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect processing of Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) commands in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) command authorization checks. Specifically, when AAA command authorization is enabled, the SCP command, which should be processed by the configuration line `aaa authorization commands 15`, is incorrectly handled by the configuration line `aaa authorization commands 0`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command authorization bypass vulnerability. Due to the incorrect processing of SCP commands, the authorization checks are not enforced as configured.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with valid level 15 credentials can bypass configured command authorization restrictions. This allows the attacker to copy files to or from the device's file system using SCP, potentially leading to:
    - Obtaining or changing the device's configuration.
    - Placing malicious files on the device.
    - Retrieving sensitive files from the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker uses the SCP protocol to connect to a vulnerable Cisco device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs valid user credentials with privilege level 15 access to the affected device.
    - The attacker must be able to connect to the device remotely using SCP.
