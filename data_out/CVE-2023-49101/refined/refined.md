Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An XSS vulnerability exists in the Axigen WebAdmin interface related to how the usage of SSL certificates is displayed. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in administrator's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   Lack of proper input sanitization/validation when displaying SSL certificate usage information in the WebAdmin interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an active admin session.
*   Attackers can potentially access the admin interface and gain full control over the Axigen mail server.
*   Attackers can potentially retrieve the admin's session cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious link containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker sends a phishing email (or other type of message) containing the crafted link to an administrator.
*   The administrator clicks the malicious link while having an active admin session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking the malicious link while they have an active WebAdmin session.
