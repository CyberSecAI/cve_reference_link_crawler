- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `algolia.js` script when displaying search results. Specifically, the script does not filter or escape user-provided content before rendering it in the search results area.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search query, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the search functionality. A user can input the malicious payload in the search input field, triggering the vulnerability when the search results are displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to use the search feature of a website that uses the vulnerable `algolia.js` script. No special privileges or prior access to the website is needed.
