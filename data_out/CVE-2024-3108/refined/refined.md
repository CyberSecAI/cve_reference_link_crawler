The provided content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an implicit intent vulnerability in the Motorola Time Weather Widget application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to implicit intent usage. This allows a malicious local application to potentially access current location data without proper authorization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious, local application can potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's current location data. This constitutes information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious application installed on the same device as the vulnerable Motorola Time Weather Widget application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the targeted Motorola device. The attacker does not require any special permissions as the vulnerable component's implicit intent can be accessed by any application on the device.
