- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently protected credentials for third-party DVR integrations within the Gallagher Command Centre Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-522, indicating a lack of proper protection for sensitive credentials. Specifically, the credentials used for DVR integrations are accessible to authenticated but unprivileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated, but unprivileged user to access the credentials for third-party DVR integrations, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or disruption of video surveillance systems. The impact is rated as having high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact and low availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring an attacker to have access to the network where the Command Centre Server is located and be able to authenticate to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, but does not require privileged access. This means that any user with a valid account on the Command Centre Server can potentially exploit the vulnerability.
