Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Code Embed plugin for WordPress lacked sufficient restrictions on who could utilize the script embedding functionality. Specifically, the plugin did not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when embedding code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin allows authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code that will execute in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages. This can lead to:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Data theft
    -  Redirection to malicious websites
    -  Defacement of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's script embedding feature. An authenticated attacker (Contributor role or higher) can embed malicious code into a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges.
- **Access to the Plugin's Embedding Functionality:** The attacker needs to be able to use the plugin's embedding functionality to insert code.
