The Code Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's script embed functionality in all versions up to, and including, 2.4 due to insufficient restrictions on who can utilize the functionality. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
