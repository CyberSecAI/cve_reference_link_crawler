Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to override properties within the `req.query` object in the `codimd` application. Specifically, the `exportType` parameter, which is expected to be a string, can be manipulated to be an object. This occurs because the `outputFormats[exportType]` expression attempts to use `exportType` as a key for the `outputFormats` object, and when `exportType` is an object, it's implicitly converted to a string via `toString()` which causes a type error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The code does not properly validate the type of the `exportType` parameter, allowing an attacker to pass an object instead of the expected string value.
*   **Uncaught Exception:** The error occurs outside a try/catch block in `lib/note/noteActions.js#L136`. This leads to an uncaught exception, causing the entire application to crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a specific URL with a manipulated `exportType` parameter (e.g., `exportType[toString]=test`), an attacker can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `/pandoc` endpoint of the application. The malicious parameter is appended to the URL via the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and know the note ID. No special privileges or authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
