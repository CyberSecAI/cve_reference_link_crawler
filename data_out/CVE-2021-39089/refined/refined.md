- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the processing of a specially crafted HTTP request by IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The system does not properly handle crafted HTTP requests, leading to exposure of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CP4S system.
