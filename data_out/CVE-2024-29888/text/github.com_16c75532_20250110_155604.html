## Description

### Summary

Using `Pickup: Local stock only` as a click-and-collect points could cause a leak of customer addresses

### Details

When using `Pickup: Local stock only` click-and-collect as a delivery method in specific conditions the customer could overwrite the warehouse address with its own, which exposes its address as click-and-collect address.

### Impact

The vulnerability can cause the leak of customer's address when using click-and-collect delivery option marked as `Local stock only`. It has impact on all orders with click-and-collect delivery method marked as `Pickup:Local stock only`

The affected versions: `>=3.14.56 <3.14.61`, `>=3.15.31 <3.15.37`, `>=3.16.27 <3.16.34`, `>=3.17.25 <3.17.32`, `>=3.18.19 <3.18.28`, `>=3.19.5 <3.19.15`

This issue has been patched in versions: `3.14.61`, `3.15.37`, `3.16.34`, `3.17.32`, `3.18.28`, `3.19.15`

### Workaround

We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest versions, in case of inability to upgrade straight away, possible workarounds are:

* turn off click-and-collect delivery method on warehouse view when `Pickup` option is set to `Local stock only`.
* cherry-pick the changes from PRs: [#15694](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/pull/15694) & [#15697](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/pull/15697)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
