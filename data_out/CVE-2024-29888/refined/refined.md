    "description": "Using `Pickup: Local stock only` as a click-and-collect points could cause a leak of customer addresses. When using `Pickup: Local stock only` click-and-collect as a delivery method in specific conditions the customer could overwrite the warehouse address with its own, which exposes its address as click-and-collect address.",
    "affected_versions": ">= 3.14.56, < 3.14.61\n>= 3.15.31, < 3.15.37\n>= 3.16.27, < 3.16.34\n>= 3.17.25, < 3.17.32\n>= 3.18.19, < 3.18.28\n>= 3.19.5, < 3.19.15",
    "patched_versions": "3.14.61\n3.15.37\n3.16.34\n3.17.32\n3.18.28\n3.19.15",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a customer selects 'Pickup: Local stock only' as a delivery method, the system incorrectly allows the customer to overwrite the warehouse address with their own. This happens because the checkout shipping address was directly being updated with the collection point address, instead of creating a copy of collection point address. This allowed the customer to modify this address and potentially leak their own address to the warehouse staff.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-359"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause the leak of customer's address when using click-and-collect delivery option marked as `Local stock only`. It has impact on all orders with click-and-collect delivery method marked as `Pickup:Local stock only`",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by customers using the web application's checkout process.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a customer of the web application and needs to have the ability to create an order and select the 'Pickup: Local stock only' delivery method."
