Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input when building HTTP header values within the `CrowCpp/Crow` framework. Specifically, the `set_header` and `add_header` functions do not prevent CRLF injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core vulnerability is an HTTP response splitting issue. This occurs because the application fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`) into HTTP header values.
- **CRLF Injection:**  The lack of sanitization enables CRLF injection, allowing attackers to manipulate the structure of the HTTP response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response. This could lead to various attacks, such as setting malicious cookies or redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.
- **Response Body Injection:** Attackers can inject a new response body into the HTTP response, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, or defacement.
- **XSS Vulnerability:** By injecting a malicious script in the response body, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating user-controlled parameters used to set or add HTTP headers using `set_header` and `add_header` functions.
- Specifically, any HTTP parameter (e.g. query parameters) used to build header values can be manipulated to include `\r\n` sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the input that is used to set the HTTP header values. This can be done by manipulating parameters that are used in the application.
- The attacker can be remote (the vulnerability is network exploitable), and does not require any special privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject additional headers and response body.
- The vulnerability is present in `CrowCpp/Crow` version `v1.0+5` (commit `dfc57edc237445a2459858d63b43195d41152522`).
- There is no fixed version currently available for this vulnerability.
