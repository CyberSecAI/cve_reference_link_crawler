- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `printFilterLine` function in `SDBrowseDataPage.php` within the SemanticDrilldown Extension for MediaWiki does not properly neutralize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `value` argument is not sanitized before being used in the output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions. The vulnerability impacts the integrity of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker manipulates the `value` GET parameter in a request to `SDBrowseDataPage.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely. It requires user interaction from the victim by opening a crafted link. The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
