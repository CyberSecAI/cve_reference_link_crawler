Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Website Content in Page or Post" fails to properly validate and escape shortcode attributes, specifically the URL attribute, before outputting it within a page or post.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to the lack of input sanitization and output escaping of shortcode attributes.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page/post by crafting a malicious URL within a shortcode, which will execute in the victim's browser when they visit the page/post, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves using a crafted URL in the `horshipsrectors_get_html_curl` shortcode. The attacker needs to inject this shortcode into a page or post.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with at least the "Contributor" role within the WordPress site is required to exploit this vulnerability. This role allows users to create and edit posts, which is necessary to inject the malicious shortcode.

The provided content also includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using a malicious HTML file hosted on a server.
