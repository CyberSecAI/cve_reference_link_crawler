The provided document contains a security advisory from Dell regarding multiple vulnerabilities in their client platforms. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2021-21522:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Dell BIOS has a flaw in its credentials management. Specifically, it allows a local attacker to set the BIOS admin password after an HDD password is set, through the Manageability Interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of password setting sequence, where setting the BIOS admin password after the HDD password bypasses some kind of protection mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the HDD.
- The attacker can set the BIOS admin password on the system through a manageability interface, potentially gaining full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system is required.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system (local admin privileges are implied because they can set a BIOS admin password).
- Attack is performed via the "Manageability Interface" to set the BIOS password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the target machine.
-  Local administrative privileges are implied, since the attacker must be able to interact with a system's manageability interface.
