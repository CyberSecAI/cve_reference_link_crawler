- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, which will then be executed by other users who access the affected content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low privileged attacker (PR:L) with User Interaction (UI:R) is required. The scope is changed (S:C) due to the nature of XSS where the injected script is executed in the context of the user's browser, leading to a different security context.
