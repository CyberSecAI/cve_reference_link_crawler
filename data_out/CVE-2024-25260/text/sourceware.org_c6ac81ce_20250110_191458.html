There are only 5 versions defined. So check the     version byte is not larger.                  * backends/arm_machineflagname.c (arm_machine_flag_name):             Check version <= 0, otherwise return NULL.          [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31058](show_bug.cgi?id=31058 "RESOLVED FIXED - global-buffer-overflow exists in the function ebl_machine_flag_name in eblmachineflagname.c")          Signed-off-by: Mark Wielaard <mark@klomp.org> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=31058#c2)  Mark Wielaard    2024-02-20 21:36:44 UTC  ``` Note that this issue was discussed when rediscovered again on January 9 by someone else running a fuzzer.  The conclusion then was that this was a normal bug and not a security issue.  Crashes in the standalone utilities on untrustworthy inputs are not normally seen as security issues, because they don't cause privilege escalation. See our SECURITY policy at: <https://sourceware.org/cgit/elfutils/tree/SECURITY> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=31058#c3)  Mark Wielaard    2024-02-21 01:32:33 UTC  ``` Also note that no actual crash occurs unless the eu-readelf is instrumented with AddressSanitizer. Otherwise eu-readelf will just print a random global string. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=31058#c4)  Mark Wielaard    2024-02-28 14:48:00 UTC  ``` This bug is referenced from CVE-2024-25260. But the CVE description "NULL pointer dereference via the handle_verdef() function at readelf.c" doesn't match this bug. And the supposed reproducer referenced from the CVE doesn't show a NULL pointer dereference, and doesn't match this bug report either. ``` |  |
