The provided content relates to CVE-2021-46994.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The mcp251x driver queues work via `priv->restart_work` when resuming after suspend, even if the interface wasn't previously enabled. The workqueue is only allocated and initialized in `mcp251x_open()`. This leads to a null pointer dereference when the driver tries to access the workqueue upon resume if it was not initialized previously.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `priv->wq` workqueue pointer may be null when `mcp251x_restart_work_handler` is called, causing a crash.
- Incorrect workqueue initialization: The workqueue was being initialized in `mcp251x_open()` rather than the `mcp251x_can_probe()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to null pointer dereference.
- Denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Suspending and resuming the system, after the mcp251x interface has not been enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to suspend and resume the system.
- The attacker needs to have access to the mcp251x CAN interface but is not required to have opened the interface.
