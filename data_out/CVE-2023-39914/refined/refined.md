- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input data validation in the bcder library's decoder.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of proper checks on input data during decoding, leading to panics instead of returning errors. This affects both immediate decoding and delayed decoding scenarios.
- Impact of exploitation: The decoder panics when encountering specific invalid data sequences, potentially causing a denial of service.
- Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted or corrupted data sent to the bcder library for decoding.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable bcder library.
