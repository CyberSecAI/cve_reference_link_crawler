- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests in the upload module of Cisco RV340 and RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing boundary checks, allowing for potential buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues when handling user-supplied data within HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system of the device. This gives the attacker complete control over the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the vulnerable device.
