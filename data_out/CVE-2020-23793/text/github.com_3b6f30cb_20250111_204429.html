# Spice-Security-Issues

I found a security issue on spice Server when I was fuzzing Spice server.

# Introduce

A handshake is required before the spice-server and spice-client can establish communication, spice-client will send a request containing some information that the server needs. This TCP request requires only host and port. So I constructed a malformed TCP packet that caused the vm to crash and the QEMu-KVM process to be restarted.

# How to run

#1. Send a malformed TCP packet(Observe the packets intercepted by Wirshark)

#2. check qemu-kvm process && kvm instance state

#3. Check libvirt's log that the virtual machine crashed

#4. Observe the virtual machine through virt-manage, found that the virtual machine has been restarted
