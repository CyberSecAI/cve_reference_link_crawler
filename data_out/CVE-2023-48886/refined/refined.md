{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of untrusted data using the Kryo library in NettyRpc v1.2. The application uses Kryo for deserialization without proper checks, allowing an attacker to send a crafted RPC request containing malicious objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Use of vulnerable libraries (Kryo)",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Remote class loading allowed (due to old JDK version or JVM argument -Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase=true)"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending a specially crafted RPC request that exploits the deserialization vulnerability.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a malicious RPC request containing a crafted object that triggers the vulnerability during deserialization by the server.",
        "The crafted object leverages the `commons-collections` and `commons-beanutils` libraries to perform a JNDI injection by utilizing a crafted `JdbcRowSetImpl` object and a `TreeMap`."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send network traffic to the NettyRpc server.",
        "Knowledge of the NettyRpc protocol to craft a malicious RPC request.",
        "Network access to the server running NettyRpc.",
        "The server needs to have dependencies on commons-collections and commons-beanutils.",
        "The server must allow remote class loading"
    ]
