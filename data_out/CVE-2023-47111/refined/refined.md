Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47111:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in ZITADEL's lockout policy implementation. The system failed to properly handle multiple parallel password check attempts, allowing attackers to bypass the configured maximum number of failed attempts before a user is locked out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition that allows multiple password check requests to be processed concurrently. This resulted in the failed attempt counter not being updated accurately.
- **Bypass of Lockout Policy:** The race condition allowed attackers to make more login attempts than permitted by the lockout policy, effectively bypassing the security measure designed to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Increased Brute-Force Vulnerability:** Attackers could try more password combinations than the configured lockout policy, making brute-force attacks more feasible.
- **Unauthorized Access:** While not explicitly stated, the increased chance of successful brute-force attacks could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Circumvention of Security Controls:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to circumvent the intended lockout mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. Attackers initiate multiple password check requests over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ZITADEL instance.
- **Ability to Initiate Parallel Requests:** The attacker must be able to generate and send multiple password check requests simultaneously.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** ZITADEL versions >=2.39.0 and <2.40.4, and versions <2.38.3 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:**  Versions 2.40.5 and 2.38.3 and later include the fix for this vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.3.
- **Specific code changes:** The provided commit diffs show changes to `internal/command/user_human_password.go`, `internal/command/user_human_password_model.go`, `internal/command/user_human_password_test.go`, and `internal/query/user_password.go` to address the issue. The fix includes a recheck of events to ensure correct state of lockout policy before processing the password check.
- **No Workaround:** The advisory explicitly states there is no workaround, and users should upgrade to patched versions.
