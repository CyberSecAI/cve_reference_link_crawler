The provided content is related to CVE-2023-4538.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of database credentials. Specifically, the database access credentials configured during installation of Comarch ERP XL are stored in a special table and encrypted with a shared key that is the same across all vulnerable versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)
- Use of a shared encryption key across all installations of vulnerable versions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the table where the encrypted credentials are stored can retrieve the database passwords in plaintext. This could lead to unauthorized access to the database and potential data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to gain access to the table in the database that contains the encrypted credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the database table where the encrypted credentials are stored, which implies they would likely need some level of access to the system or database.
