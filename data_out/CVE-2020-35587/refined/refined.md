Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the CVE-2020-35587 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of binary code obfuscation in the Mersive Solstice Pod firmware. This means that the compiled code is easily readable and understandable after reverse engineering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the absence of code obfuscation, which is a security measure that makes the code harder to understand and reverse engineer.  This makes it easier for an attacker to analyze the inner workings of the application and potentially find other vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The lack of obfuscation can lead to several impacts:

*   **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** Attackers can analyze and bypass security checks within the application, such as license verification.
*   **Intellectual Property Theft:** Competitors can reverse-engineer the code to understand and replicate the software's functionality, leading to intellectual property theft.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can modify the application, inject malicious code, and distribute the compromised version to unsuspecting users.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves:
1.  **Obtaining the Firmware:** Attackers need to obtain the firmware of the Solstice Pod.
2.  **Reverse Engineering:** Using tools like apktool and baksmali, they disassemble/decompile the firmware into readable Smali/Java code.
3.  **Analyzing the Code:** The attacker analyzes the non-obfuscated code for security flaws, license checks, or other exploitable information.
4.  **Exploitation:** Using the reverse-engineered knowledge to bypass security measures, develop competing products, or distribute malware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to have the skills to disassemble/decompile and analyze code.
*   **Access to Firmware:** The attacker needs access to the Solstice Pod's firmware.
*   **No direct network access required.** It can be achieved with access to the firmware.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of Mersive Solstice Pods running a firmware version prior to **3.0.3 (August 2017)**. Later versions may still be vulnerable.
* The github content provides links to tools used for this type of attack, specifically `apktool` and `baksmali`.
* There's a potential for wide impact, including:
    *   Commercial risks for the product
    *   Supply chain attacks through distribution of malicious versions

**CVSS Vector:**
The provided CVSS vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicates:
*   **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be launched over a network.
*   **AC:L (Low):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
*   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are needed to launch the attack.
*   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required for the attack.
*   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect other components outside the scope of the vulnerability
*   **C:H (High):** The attack can lead to high confidentiality impact.
*   **I:N (None):** No integrity impact
*   **A:N (None):** No availability impact
