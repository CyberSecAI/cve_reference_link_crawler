For Energy- and Watersupply
# **HIGH-LEIT** - An ADMS System for Power Supply Grids

The challenges faced by owners of power grids continually increase with the digitisation of the energy market. Ensuring grid stability at all voltage levels and IT security requires the use of a grid control system that meets the highest standards.

As an open control system in client-server architecture, the HIGH-LEIT network control system ADMS offers functionalities for operating and monitoring as well as archiving and reporting. In addition, HIGH-LEIT has some advanced functionalities to cope with current challenges in energy supply. Division-related functions, such as topology for pipe networks, topology current and fault location, network calculation and short-circuit current calculation as well as the network trainer round these up.

The HIGH-LEIT network control system is designed for applications in the energy and water supply and environmental sectors as well as for industrial tasks. The high requirements for OT security are fully granted. This ensures investment security for the energy supply.

With the HIGH-LEIT network control system you are on the safe side!

## Features

### User interface

The user interface offers some comfort functions. Variable desktop layouts allow individual design and customization of the user interface. Geo image allow very large amounts of information to be managed and displayed in a process screen. In combination with a large screen, this allows fast and clear navigation in the modeled network or in the GIS image view. The end-to-end connectivity functions allow the operator to quickly generate interactive evaluations. All data can also be displayed on different monitors via multiscreening. To make the handling of large plant images comfortable, the network control system HIGH-LEIT provides a large number of additional functions such as (remote) zooming, scrolling and decluttering. Furthermore, notes, comments and markers can be easily assigned.
### Operate and observe

The HIGH-LEIT network control system provides user-friendly display and operation support for safe network operation. This includes intuitive alarm guidance throughout the system as well as external alarming. Further, individually tailored functions support network operation. Drag & Drop, Zooming/Panning & Decluttering are just some of the standard applications.
### Object-oriented Engineering

The engineering of the network control system is typified, which greatly reduces the parameterization effort and avoids errors.An Efficient engineering. The consistent object-oriented approach requires very little effort even for subsequent changes in engineering - all objects of a type are changed with just a few clicks. Engineering takes place offline and therefore has no direct influence on the database in the network control system.
### Archiving and reporting

Extensive possibilities for archiving, evaluation and reportings are available. A reporting archive for periodic, event-oriented as well as all events including all comments comprise the extensive archives. Comprehensive evaluations with respective representation in the system simplify the day-to-day work. A modern dashboard is available for all "on the fly" evaluations.
### Client capability

As a multi-client capable system, the HIGH-LEIT network control system can process the data from different plants, media or even from several customers separately on the same system. The access authorizations - structured according to workstations, functions, operators, areas and clients - can be parameterized by the user himself. Here, for example, different partner municipalities can manage their own electricity gas or water networks via a central network control system as respective clients.
### Advanced functions in all sectors

It must be ensured that the ever-increasing challenges facing network operators can be met with maximum reliability. For this purpose, the HIGH-LEIT network control system offers corresponding division-related network control functions: Topological network representation, markings and switching fault protection, network provisioning, fault location (earth fault and short circuit), schematic and geo-based network representation, network calculation, state estimation, short circuit current calculation, switching order management, pipe network topology, water management, leakage detection and simulation.
### IT-Security

The HIGH-LEIT network control system meets the current requirements for IT security, including a permanent update service. This ensures the required investment security for the energy supply. A selection of measures that raise the HIGH-LEIT network control system to the latest security level is listed below. These include: Zone model for maximum security, regular updates of the application, installation of redundant domain controllers, basic hardening of all devices and network components, central Windows Server Update Service for the distribution of operating system patches and operation in the data center as a service including secure communication links.
