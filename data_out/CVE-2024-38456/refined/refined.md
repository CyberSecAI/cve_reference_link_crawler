Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38456:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions on the `prunsrv.exe` executable located within the HIGH-LEIT application directories. Specifically, the Active Directory group "HL-TS-Gruppe," which is required for users interacting with HIGH-LEIT, has modify permissions on this executable, and those permissions are inherited from the parent directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive modify permissions granted to the "HL-TS-Gruppe" on the `prunsrv.exe` executable and its parent directory.
- **Service Binary Hijacking:**  Attackers can replace the legitimate `prunsrv.exe` with a malicious executable. The vulnerable service runs as local system, meaning the attacker's malicious executable will also run as local system once executed via the service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows any authenticated user in the "HL-TS-Gruppe" to escalate their privileges to local system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any arbitrary code with local system privileges.
- **Lateral Movement:** If the application folder is shared across multiple systems, the attacker can potentially use this vulnerability for lateral movement.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have an account in the "HL-TS-Gruppe" Active Directory group, granting them access to modify files on the system where HIGH-LEIT is installed.
- **File Modification:** The attacker replaces the legitimate `prunsrv.exe` with a malicious one.
- **Service Restart:** The attacker either waits for a system reboot or forces one for the service to run the modified executable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials of a user in the "HL-TS-Gruppe" to have access to modify files.
- **File System Access:** The attacker must have file system access to the HIGH-LEIT installation directory (e.g., `D:\hlxw` or `D:\hlnt`) to modify the `prunsrv.exe`.
- **System Restart (indirectly):** The attacker needs the system or the service to restart for their modified `prunsrv.exe` to be executed.

**Affected products/versions:**
- HIGH-LEIT 4: Versions 4.25.00.00 to 4.25.01.01
- HIGH-LEIT 5: Version 5.08.01.03

**Mitigations:**
- **HIGH-LEIT 4:**
   - Update to version 4.25.01.02 or newer.
   - Apply the vendor's workaround via GPO.
   - Manually remove the modify permission of the Active Directory group "HL-TS-Gruppe" on the folder "D:\hlnt".
- **HIGH-LEIT 5:**
   - Update to version 5.8.01.04 (planned for 31.10.2024).
   - Apply the vendor's workaround via GPO.
   - Manually remove the modify permission of the Active Directory group "HL-TS-Gruppe" on the folder "D:\hlxw".
