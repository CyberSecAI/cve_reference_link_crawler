Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6987

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `sql-column` parameter within the String Locator WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This occurs because the plugin directly uses the unsanitized `sql-column` parameter from the GET request to output content within a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the page.
- **User Compromise:** If an attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link or performing an action leading to the execution of the injected script, they could potentially:
    - Steal sensitive information (cookies, session tokens, etc.)
    - Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Modify the content of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via the `sql-column` parameter in the GET request.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires tricking a user into interacting with the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the malicious script in the `sql-column` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in String Locator plugin versions up to and including 2.6.5.
- The vulnerability requires `WP_DEBUG` to be enabled to be exploitable.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.6 by using `esc_html()` to sanitize the `sql-column` parameter.
- The fix is present in the file `includes/Extension/SQL/views/editor/sql.php`.
- The vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.1.

**Changes in Code:**
- In vulnerable versions, the code directly uses `$_GET['sql-column']`.
- The patched version uses `esc_html($_GET['sql-column'])` to sanitize the input before using it in the context.
