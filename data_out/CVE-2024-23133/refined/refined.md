The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Autodesk products, including CVE-2024-23133.

**CVE-2024-23133:**

*   **Root cause:** A maliciously crafted STP file, when parsed in `ASMDATAX228A.dll` through Autodesk applications, can lead to a memory corruption vulnerability by write access violation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Memory corruption due to write access violation.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, could lead to code execution in the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vector:** Parsing a maliciously crafted STP file.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted STP file to be opened by a vulnerable Autodesk application.
