  "summary": "This commit prevents timing attacks when comparing passwords in Gradio by using `hmac.compare_digest` for secure password comparison.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The original password comparison used a direct equality check (`==`), which is vulnerable to timing attacks. An attacker could potentially deduce the correct password by measuring the time it takes for the comparison to fail, as the comparison would take longer the more characters of the input password are correct.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability in password comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially guess passwords by observing the timing differences during login attempts.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks by observing login request timing.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make login attempts and observe the timing of the responses. No specific level of privilege is needed, just access to the login interface.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was resolved by using `hmac.compare_digest` instead of a simple equality check, which prevents timing attacks by taking the same amount of time to compare the correct password and incorrect passwords."
