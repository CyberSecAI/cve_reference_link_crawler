- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can perform actions that they are not supposed to be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or access.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the function with missing authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber (unprivileged user) to exploit the vulnerability.
