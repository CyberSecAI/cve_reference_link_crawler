- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XPS files within PDF-XChange Editor, which allows a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious XPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious XPS file or a malicious website that will be accessed by the user. No special privileges are needed for exploitation other than user interaction.
