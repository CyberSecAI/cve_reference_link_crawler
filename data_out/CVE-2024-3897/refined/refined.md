Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3897

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `ays_pb_create_author` AJAX action within the "Popup Box â€“ Best WordPress Popup Plugin" for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check before executing the `ays_pb_create_author` AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate all email addresses registered on the affected WordPress website. This is a form of data leakage that could be used in further attacks like phishing or spam campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **AJAX Action Trigger:** Attackers can exploit this by directly sending requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint `ays_pb_create_author`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to have any valid accounts or roles on the WordPress website. They can perform the attack without logging in.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected website.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code was present in versions up to and including 4.3.6 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 4.3.7 by adding a capability check for the AJAX action.
* The provided diff shows the added permission check in the `ays_pb_create_author` function.
