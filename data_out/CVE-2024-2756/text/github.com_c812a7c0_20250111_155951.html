## Description

### Summary

Due to an incomplete fix to [CVE-2022-31629](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c43m-486j-j32p "CVE-2022-31629"), network and same-site attackers can set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications.

### Details

The vulnerability is identical to one previously described in <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81727>. Unfortunatly, since [CVE-2022-31629](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c43m-486j-j32p "CVE-2022-31629") got only partially fixed in PHP >8.1.11, cookies starting with `_[Host-` are parsed by PHP applications as `__Host-`. Notice that I reported this vulnerability multiple times via email after the fix for [CVE-2022-31629](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c43m-486j-j32p "CVE-2022-31629") landed (I am the original reporter of that CVE), but I guess that the message got lost.

### PoC

```
$ echo '<?php echo(json_encode($_COOKIE)); ?>' > x

$ docker run -p 8080:8080 --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) php:latest php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 $(pwd)/x

$ curl -b '_[Host-x=y' localhost:8080/x
{"__Host-x":"y"}
```

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-2756

### Weaknesses

[CWE-20](/advisories?query=cwe%3A20)
