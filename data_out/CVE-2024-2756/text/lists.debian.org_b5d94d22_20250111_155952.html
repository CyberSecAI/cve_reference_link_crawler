Package        : php7.3
Version        : 7.3.31-1~deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-2756 CVE-2024-3096

Security issues were found in PHP, a widely-used open source general
purpose scripting language, which could result in information disclosure
or incorrect validation of password hashes.

CVE-2024-2756

    Marco Squarcina discovered that network and same-site attackers can
    set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which is
    treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications.

    This issue stems from an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629.

CVE-2024-3096

    Eric Stern discovered that if a password stored with password_hash()
    starts with a null byte (\x00), testing a blank string as the
    password via password_verify() incorrectly returns true.

    If a user were able to create a password with a leading null byte
    (unlikely, but syntactically valid), the issue would allow an
    attacker to trivially compromise the victim's account by attempting
    to sign in with a blank string.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.3.31-1~deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your php7.3 packages.
