- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "Button Image" custom HTML field allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected pages. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page in the WordPress admin panel. An attacker with administrator or other high privilege access can insert the malicious payload into the "Button Image" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator or other high privilege access to modify plugin settings.
