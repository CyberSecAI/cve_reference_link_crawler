## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Save as PDF < 3.2.0 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. On the "Settings > Save as PDF > Basic Settings", enable custom HTML for "Button Image"
2. Add the following payload in the field: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
3. Observe the XSS vulnerability on all pages.
