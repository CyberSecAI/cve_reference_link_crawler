{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input during account registration, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the vulnerable pages (`voter.php` and `profile.php`). This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web page or further attacks on the user's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the user registration form, specifically targeting the first name, last name and username fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only requires the ability to register a new account on the application with malicious javascript."
