In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix memory leak in __qlt_24xx_handle_abts()

Commit 8f394da36a36 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Drop TARGET_SCF_LOOKUP_LUN_FROM_TAG")
made the __qlt_24xx_handle_abts() function return early if
tcm_qla2xxx_find_cmd_by_tag() didn't find a command, but it missed to clean
up the allocated memory for the management command.
