Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2022-48650.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `__qlt_24xx_handle_abts` function within the QLogic Fibre Channel SCSI driver (`qla2xxx`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing cleanup of allocated memory for a management command. Specifically, if the `tcm_qla2xxx_find_cmd_by_tag()` function fails to find a command corresponding to an abort request, the allocated memory for `mcmd` is not released before returning.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The memory leak will lead to memory exhaustion over time if the `__qlt_24xx_handle_abts()` function continues to fail finding commands while also allocating the management command memory. This could potentially lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can trigger the memory leak by sending abort requests to the target SCSI device for commands that do not exist or cannot be found.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to interact with the target SCSI device and send abort requests. This typically involves access to the SCSI target interface, which might be on the same host or on a remote host connected through a network.
