  "vulnerability_details": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-33993",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'view' parameter of the '/candidate/index.php' URL within the School Event Management System 1.0 application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript and send it to a victim. If the victim opens the crafted URL, the malicious script will execute within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to the attacker obtaining the victim's session details (such as session cookies), which can then be used for session hijacking or other malicious purposes.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based. The attacker crafts a malicious URL and sends it to a victim, typically through social engineering (e.g., phishing emails, social media messages). The victim needs to click the URL for the attack to succeed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript and convince the victim to click on it. This requires no special privileges on the target system itself and can be executed remotely."
