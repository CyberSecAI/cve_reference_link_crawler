## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on December 20, 2023, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Other](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/guide/vuln/ug65p90000019by0-att/000098799.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable:

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response after obtaining the report and details (on September 28, 2011)

   - No response to 4 separate emails (sent from March 22, 2013 to December 8, 2013)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on December 13, 2013) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/)" and to the disclosure of the product name and its version (listed on March 20, 2014) in “[Information Request](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/DID35448320.html)” on JVN

   - No response to the announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on December 7, 2023)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified:

   It was verified by IPA that the product allows unintended operations when accessing a specially crafted page, which violates the "Integrity" of the product. For verification details, refer to the "Verification" section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product:

   The developer either has not published an advisory for this vulnerability or it is not confirmed that the developer knows all the product users, therefore, it was judged there is a risk that the product users who do not know of the existence of the vulnerability exist.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate:

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
