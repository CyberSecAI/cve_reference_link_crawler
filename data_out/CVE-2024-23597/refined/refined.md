- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TvRock application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a logged-in user of TvRock accesses a specially crafted page (controlled by the attacker), unintended operations can be performed. This could allow the attacker to make changes to TV recording timers, settings, or perform other actions within the application, depending on the available functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed through a specially crafted web page. The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to visit the malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create and host a malicious web page and trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable TvRock application into visiting that page. No special privileges or network position is required other than being able to host a web page.
