The provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds read in the VAX disassembler within the radare2 project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `anal_vax.c` file.
- Specifically, the issue is within the code handling the `calls` opcode (0xfb) where an out-of-bounds read is triggered due to an insufficient length check.
- The code attempts to read 2 bytes from the buffer at offset 3 to construct a 32-bit delta, but it only checks if the length is greater than 6. This can cause an out-of-bounds read when the remaining buffer size is less than 2 bytes after the initial 7 bytes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- This can lead to a crash, as indicated by the commit message "Fix oobread in VAX disassembler (tests_64920) ##crash".

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafting a VAX bytecode with the `calls` opcode (0xfb), where the code attempts to read beyond the buffer length, causing an out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted VAX bytecode as input to radare2, triggering the vulnerable code path.
