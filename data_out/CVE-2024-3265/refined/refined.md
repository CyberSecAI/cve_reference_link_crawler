- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly escape parameters appended to an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrator privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. In this PoC, the attacker demonstrates the capability to induce a sleep command in SQL, indicating successful injection.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must be logged in as an administrator. They can then navigate to the plugin's admin page and inject malicious SQL code via the "List of Post Meta Keys" field when creating a new shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrator-level access to the WordPress instance.
