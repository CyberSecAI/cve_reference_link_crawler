CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14, does not sufficiently encode user-controlled input, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through /admin/moduleinterface.php, in multiple parameters. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted JavaScript payload to an authenticated user and partially hijack their browser session.
