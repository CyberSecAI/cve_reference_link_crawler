Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `GetParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda FH1202 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from a user-controlled input (`mac` parameter) to a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Unsafe Function:** The usage of `strcpy` is vulnerable because it doesn't check if the source string size exceeds destination buffer's size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially achieving arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** A simpler exploit could cause a crash of the device or service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- **`mac` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `mac` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/GetParentControlInfo`.
- **Ability to Craft Payload:** The attacker needs to be able to create a payload that overflows the buffer.

**Summary:**
The Tenda FH1202 router firmware is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow through the `GetParentControlInfo` function due to the usage of `strcpy` and the lack of bounds checking on the user-provided `mac` parameter in a POST request. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.
