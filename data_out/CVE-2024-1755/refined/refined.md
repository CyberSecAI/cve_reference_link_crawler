Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `nps-computy` WordPress plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in its options-handling functionality, specifically related to deleting poll results.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF checks in the plugin. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, perform unintended actions on the WordPress site.
    *   **Unvalidated Input:** The provided proof-of-concept code shows that the 'event' parameter with the value 'delete\_all' can trigger the deletion of all poll responses, which indicates a lack of input validation and sanitization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Loss:** An attacker can cause the deletion of all poll responses by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, leading to a loss of valuable data.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** A successful attack allows an attacker to make a logged-in admin perform actions without their knowledge or consent.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF Attack:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML form that is submitted by an authenticated administrator.
    *   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin into opening the malicious page, which can be achieved through social engineering techniques.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **External attacker:** An attacker can be external to the target system.
    *   **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to have the ability to convince an admin to visit the malicious page.
    *   **No access required:** The attacker does not need any specific access to the server or the WordPress dashboard other than being able to lure a logged-in admin into clicking a malicious link.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in the `options-general.php` page of the plugin.
    *   The vulnerable code allows deletion of all poll results when the 'event' parameter equals 'delete\_all'.
    *   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.6 of the `nps-computy` plugin.
