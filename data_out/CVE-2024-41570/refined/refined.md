- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and authorization checks when handling socket commands within the Havoc C2 teamserver's demon agent handler. Specifically, the `COMMAND_SOCKET` functionality, intended for internal use by registered agents, is exposed and can be triggered by unauthenticated requests with a spoofed demon agent ID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Unauthenticated Access:** The teamserver does not properly authenticate or authorize incoming requests before processing them, allowing attackers to register a fake agent and subsequently send commands to it.
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `COMMAND_SOCKET` functionality allows an attacker to create a TCP socket on the teamserver, connect to an arbitrary IP address and port, and read and write traffic through it, effectively using the teamserver as an SSRF proxy.
    - **Missing Input Validation:** The teamserver does not validate the arguments provided when initiating the `COMMAND_SOCKET` requests (target IP address, port, etc) allowing the attacker to specify arbitrary targets.
    - **Missing Request ID Validation:** The teamserver does not properly validate the `RequestID` of all commands, allowing an attacker to utilize `COMMAND_SOCKET`, `COMMAND_PIVOT`, and `BEACON_OUTPUT` commands without the C2 operator issuing a related task.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Attribution Leakage:** Attackers can leak the origin IP of a teamserver behind public redirectors by connecting to an attacker controlled server and observing the source IP.
    - **Misattribution:** Attackers can abuse vulnerable teamservers as a redirector by using the compromised server as a pivot point for network traffic.
    - **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal network services by routing traffic through any listening socks proxies on the teamserver.
    - **Arbitrary TCP Connections:** The attacker can establish arbitrary TCP connections, potentially leading to further exploitation of internal services.
    - **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can exfiltrate data by connecting to an attacker controlled server.
    - **General C2 Abuse:** The attacker can potentially take control of the C2 communication by exploiting the command handling weakness.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the teamserver's HTTP listener endpoint that is typically exposed to handle agent callbacks.
    - An attacker crafts a series of HTTP POST requests to the listener endpoint with spoofed agent callback data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary HTTP POST requests to the teamserver's exposed listener endpoint.
    - The attacker must have knowledge of the magic bytes and other protocol details for the demon agent callback. This information can be obtained by analyzing the demon binary, its traffic, or based off public C2 profiles.
    - The attacker requires the IP address or hostname of the target teamserver.
    - The attacker does not require any prior authentication, credentials, or privileges on the target teamserver.
