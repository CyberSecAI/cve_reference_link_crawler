Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'reg-number-field' shortcode of the ProfilePress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within the shortcode's attributes, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts. Specifically, the `esc_attr` function was applied to sanitize attributes, however, it did not prevent the use of `on*` attributes that can execute Javascript.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages that include the vulnerable shortcode.
*   When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script executes in their browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Stealing of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the 'reg-number-field' shortcode attributes.
*   An attacker with contributor-level or higher access can inject malicious scripts through the shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have an account with at least contributor-level permissions on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to add or edit content that uses the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in ProfilePress plugin versions up to and including 4.14.3.
*   The fix was implemented in version 4.14.4 by adding an additional check for attributes starting with "on" (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`). These attributes are now skipped, preventing the execution of malicious JavaScript within the attributes.
*   The fix also sanitizes shortcode attributes using `sanitize_text_field(trim($key))`
*   The `esc_attr` function was also used to sanitize attribute values.
