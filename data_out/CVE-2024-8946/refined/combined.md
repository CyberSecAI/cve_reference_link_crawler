Also, it lead to global buffer overflow at the next for loop, because it compare the string with “/”.  Thus, to sum up,   * there is always global-buffer-overflow for non “/” unmount with the mount “/” * there is heap-buffer-overflow if longer mount strings unmount earlier than shorter mount strings  Crash Log ``` #1 0x5555557c96c1 in mp_vfs_umount /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../extmod/vfs.c:276:34 #2 0x555555782c1c in mp_execute_bytecode /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/vm.c:1042:21 #3 0x55555574261b in fun_bc_call /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objfun.c:273:42 #4 0x555555781b2c in mp_execute_bytecode /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/vm.c:957:21 #5 0x55555574261b in fun_bc_call /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objfun.c:273:42 #6 0x555555903f3d in execute_from_lexer /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:161:13 #7 0x555555902ad5 in do_file /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:310:12 #8 0x555555902ad5 in main_ /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:722:19 #9 0x7ffff7c29d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16 #10 0x7ffff7c29e3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3 #11 0x555555593a34 in _start (/home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/build-standard/micropython+0x3fa34) ``` Patch we need to use “min” length between them, or compare the length first.  ``` mp_obj_t mp_vfs_umount(mp_obj_t mnt_in) {     // remove vfs from the mount table     mp_vfs_mount_t *vfs = NULL;     size_t mnt_len;     const char *mnt_str = NULL;     if (mp_obj_is_str(mnt_in)) {         mnt_str = mp_obj_str_get_data(mnt_in, &mnt_len);     }     for (mp_vfs_mount_t **vfsp = &MP_STATE_VM(vfs_mount_table); *vfsp != NULL; vfsp = &(*vfsp)->next) {         if ((mnt_str != NULL && !memcmp(mnt_str, (*vfsp)->str, min((*vfsp)->len, mnt_len + 1))) || (*vfsp)->obj == mnt_in) {             vfs = *vfsp;             *vfsp = (*vfsp)->next;             break;         }     } ... ```  ***Thank you for taking the time to review our bug report! :)*** |

# Submit #409312: micropython v1.23.0 Heap-based Buffer Overflow[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | micropython v1.23.0 Heap-based Buffer Overflow |
| --- | --- |
| Description | In the VFS unmount process, the comparison between the mounted path string and the unmount requested string is based solely on the length of the unmount string, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow read. |

```
The comparison between the given unmount string and existing mount strings
were made by the given string, which leads to buffer overflow.

Fixes issue [#13006](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/13006).

Also, it lead to global buffer overflow at the next for loop, because it compare the string with “/”.  Thus, to sum up,   * there is always global-buffer-overflow for non “/” unmount with the mount “/” * there is heap-buffer-overflow if longer mount strings unmount earlier than shorter mount strings  Crash Log ``` #1 0x5555557c96c1 in mp_vfs_umount /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../extmod/vfs.c:276:34 #2 0x555555782c1c in mp_execute_bytecode /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/vm.c:1042:21 #3 0x55555574261b in fun_bc_call /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objfun.c:273:42 #4 0x555555781b2c in mp_execute_bytecode /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/vm.c:957:21 #5 0x55555574261b in fun_bc_call /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/../../py/objfun.c:273:42 #6 0x555555903f3d in execute_from_lexer /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:161:13 #7 0x555555902ad5 in do_file /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:310:12 #8 0x555555902ad5 in main_ /home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/main.c:722:19 #9 0x7ffff7c29d8f in __libc_start_call_main csu/../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58:16 #10 0x7ffff7c29e3f in __libc_start_main csu/../csu/libc-start.c:392:3 #11 0x555555593a34 in _start (/home/qbit/testing-2023/micropython/ports/unix/build-standard/micropython+0x3fa34) ``` Patch we need to use “min” length between them, or compare the length first.  ``` mp_obj_t mp_vfs_umount(mp_obj_t mnt_in) {     // remove vfs from the mount table     mp_vfs_mount_t *vfs = NULL;     size_t mnt_len;     const char *mnt_str = NULL;     if (mp_obj_is_str(mnt_in)) {         mnt_str = mp_obj_str_get_data(mnt_in, &mnt_len);     }     for (mp_vfs_mount_t **vfsp = &MP_STATE_VM(vfs_mount_table); *vfsp != NULL; vfsp = &(*vfsp)->next) {         if ((mnt_str != NULL && !memcmp(mnt_str, (*vfsp)->str, min((*vfsp)->len, mnt_len + 1))) || (*vfsp)->obj == mnt_in) {             vfs = *vfsp;             *vfsp = (*vfsp)->next;             break;         }     } ... ```  ***Thank you for taking the time to review our bug report! :)*** |
