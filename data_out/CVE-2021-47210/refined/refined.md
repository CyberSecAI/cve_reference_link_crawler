The provided content relates to a change in the Linux kernel, specifically to the `tps6598x_block_read` function within the USB Type-C driver. The change addresses a potential issue where providing an invalid length to this function could trigger a kernel warning (WARN_ON) and potentially lead to a system crash if panic-on-warn is enabled.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `tps6598x_block_read` function in the Linux kernel's USB Type-C driver was using `WARN_ON` to check if the requested read length is valid, meaning a read with length greater than `sizeof(data)` will trigger a warning and possibly a crash if the kernel is configured to panic on warnings.
- The use of `WARN_ON` for an invalid length check could lead to an unintended system crash, even though the condition itself is a recoverable error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of `WARN_ON` instead of returning an error for an invalid length parameter in the `tps6598x_block_read` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious or faulty application could trigger a kernel warning and possible system crash by calling `tps6598x_block_read` with an invalid read length.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user space program can trigger this by calling the read function with a length that exceeds the buffer size `TPS_MAX_LEN + 1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the USB Type-C subsystem and trigger the `tps6598x_block_read` function with an invalid length. This could be a process with sufficient privileges or a faulty driver.

**Changes:**
- The `WARN_ON` check has been replaced with a simple `if` statement which returns `-EINVAL` if the length is too large.
- This change avoids the potential system crash and provides a more robust way to handle the error.
