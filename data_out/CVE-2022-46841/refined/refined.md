- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Oxygen Builder plugin for WordPress versions prior to 4.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions within the WordPress site, using their current authentication context. This could lead to unauthorized modifications, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request that is triggered by a logged-in user, typically by enticing them to click on a link or visit a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and needs an authenticated user of the WordPress site to trigger the request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
