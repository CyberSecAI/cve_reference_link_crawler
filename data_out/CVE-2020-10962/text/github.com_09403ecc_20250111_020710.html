[PSAppDeployToolkit 3.10.0](/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/releases/tag/3.10.0)

**Version 3.10.0 [03/27/2024]**

* Added the ability to configure Microsoft Edge Extensions using ExtensionSettings. Function: Configure-EdgeExtensions. This enables Edge Extensions to be installed and managed like applications, enabling extensions to be pushed to specific devices or users alongside existing GPO/Intune extension policies. This should not be used in conjunction with Edge Management Service which leverages the same registry key to configure Edge extensions.
* Added the ability to copy the Toolkit folder and files to a cache folder on the local machine and execute from there.
  + Functions: Copy-ContentToCache and Remove-ContentFromCache. The cache path can be configured in the config.xml file, default is $envProgramData\SoftwareCache. When Copy-ContentToCache is used, $dirFiles is updated to point to the local cache path.
* Added the ability to copy files to all user profiles.
  + Functions: Copy-FileToUserProfiles and Remove-FileFromUserProfiles
* Changed Copy-File to use Robocopy by default, overcoming the 260-character limitation of native PowerShell Copy-Item and providing more comprehensive file copy functionality and logging. This can be toggled off in the config.xml file by setting Toolkit\_UseRobocopy = $false
* Added Log File Rotation
* Added VSCode workspace with default settings for PowerShell code formatting, default version (Windows PowerShell) and PSScriptAnalyzer linting.
* Added ability to position progress dialogs to 'TopLeft', 'Top', 'TopRight', 'TopCenter', 'BottomLeft', 'Bottom', 'BottomRight'
* Added -Wow6432Node switches for 32-bit registry support to all registry functions.
* Improved all user interface components to work correctly in High DPI mode.
* Improved all images and icons for brand consistency and double the resolution for High DPI mode.
* Improved Get-RunningProcesses function, reducing complexity and improving performance
* Improved Russian (RU) translations PR [#843](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/pull/843)
* Improved German (DE) translations PR [#854](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/pull/854)
* Added translations for many missing strings across a number of different languages. Thanks to ChatGPT for being an XML workhorse :)
* Added shortcut keys for UI buttons - Alt-D for Defer, Alt-P for Close Programs, Alt-C for Continue
* Fixed issue with Execute-MSI adding "Transforms" Parameters to uninstall Command Line [#828](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/828)
* Resolved an issue where ConvertTo-NTAccountOrSID would throw an error when attempting to convert orphaned accounts, a warning is now displayed rather than an error. [#865](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/865)
* Resolved an issue where if WindowStyle parameter is set to 'Hidden', then the UseShellExecute parameter to should be set to '$true' [#678](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/678)
* Resolved an issue with how Set-ActiveSetup comma-separated version strings were compared to determine which was greater [#743](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/743)
* Resolved an issue where $IsMultiSessionOS did not return true for Windows 11 Enterprise Multi-Session [#807](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/807)
* Improved detection of OOBE / ESP
* Improved documentation of Set-ActiveSetup function.
* Resolved an issue where Execute-ProcessAsUser ran into issue when called multiple times because it overwrote files from previous invocation [#333](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/333)
* Resolved an issue where Get-LoggedOnUser choose the wrong user session on Windows multi-session workstation operating systems [#863](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/863)
* Improved Execute-Process with a useful example [#835](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/835)
* Improved Execute-MSI so that all repetitive references to .log or .txt file extension in $LogName variable are all removed [#759](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/759)
* Improved Get-HardwarePlatform to add support for detecting Parallels virtual machines [#838](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/838)
* Improved Execute-ProcessAsUser and how it parses and executes command-line arguments. [#794](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/794) [#894](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/pull/894) [#782](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/782) [#762](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/762) [#851](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/851)
* Improved setup for $ResolveParameters (uses proper filter and piping, supports arrays and dictionaries) [#874](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/pull/874)
* Improved setup for setting $ScriptSource in Write-Log.
* Improve $envOffice variable setup by reducing the number of Get-ItemProperty calls.
* Factor in GPO-configured UpdateChannel property vs. CDNBaseURL property for $envOfficeChannel. [#837](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/issues/837)
* Add "monthly enterprise" UUID to $envOfficeChannel setup.
* Changed when dot-sourcing of AppDeployToolkitExtensions occurs, so that use of custom functions can make use of UI elements, e.g. displaying a progress dialog.
* Improved overall codebase for better compliance with Strict Mode.
* Improved use of arrays throughout in order to improve performance.
* Improved threat safety when using thread on user interface elements should result in fewer issues with progress dialogs.
* Fixed UI message strings being incorrectly spaced on screen.
