Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The script's temporary file path was set to a location that was writeable by a standard user. This location was defined in the configuration XML of the PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit (PSADT).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Location:** The primary vulnerability lies in the fact that a standard user had write access to the directory used for temporary files by the PSADT script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to achieve elevation of privilege. By writing malicious content to the temporary file location, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the elevated privileges of the running script.
*  The vulnerability could be exploited only while the script is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Injection:** An attacker would need to write a malicious file to the insecure temp file path while a PSADT script is running with elevated permissions.
*   The exploit is only possible when a deployment uses the `Show-InstallationWelcome` function with the parameter `-BlockExecution` or the internal function `Block-AppExecution`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Standard User Access:** The attacker needs to have standard user access to the system where the PSADT script is being executed.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the insecure temp file path and be able to write to it.
* **Script Execution with Elevated Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to exploit a scenario where the vulnerable script is run with elevated permissions.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by moving the temporary file path to a write-protected location.
*   A standalone PowerShell script was created to identify and remediate the issue in existing PSAppDeployToolkit deployment packages. This script (`Set-ToolkitTempPath.ps1`) can be found at [https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/blob/master/Sources/Set-ToolkitTempPath.ps1](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit/blob/master/Sources/Set-ToolkitTempPath.ps1).
*   The fix will break deployment scripts that run with standard user rights, which is not a common use case.
