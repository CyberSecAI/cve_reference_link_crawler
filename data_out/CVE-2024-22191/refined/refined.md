Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-22191:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `key_value` field in Avo versions 3.2.3 and earlier, as well as 2.46 and earlier, was vulnerable to stored XSS. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the value of the `key_value` field is inserted directly into the HTML code without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`key_value` field) before rendering it in the HTML, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `key_value` field.
- When a victim views the page containing the malicious code, the script will execute in their browser.
- This can lead to stealing sensitive information, hijacking accounts, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker needs to find a `key_value` field in the application that is vulnerable and enter malicious input.
- A user must then view a page where this malicious input is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low privileges are required to inject malicious code.
- User interaction is required in order for the malicious code to be executed. The victim needs to view the page containing the injected script.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `avo/fields/common/key_value_component.html.erb` where the value is interpreted directly as HTML.
- A proof-of-concept is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability by injecting a script tag into the value field and triggering an alert.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input using `DOMPurify` before inserting the key/value pair into the HTML.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
- Patched versions include 3.3.0 and 2.47
