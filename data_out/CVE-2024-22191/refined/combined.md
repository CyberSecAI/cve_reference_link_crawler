# stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in key\_value field

High

[adrianthedev](/adrianthedev)
published
GHSA-ghjv-mh6x-7q6h
Jan 16, 2024

## Package

bundler

avo
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 3.2.3
<= 2.46

## Patched versions

3.3.0
2.47

## Description

### Summary

A **stored cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was found in the **key\_value** field of Avo v3.2.3. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

### Details

The value of the key\_value is inserted directly into the HTML code. In the current version of Avo (possibly also older versions), the value is not properly sanitized before it is inserted into the HTML code.

This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the key\_value field. When a victim views the page containing the malicious code, the code will be executed in their browser.

In [avo/fields/common/key\_value\_component.html.erb](https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/blob/main/app/components/avo/fields/common/key_value_component.html.erb#L38C21-L38C33) the value is taken in lines **38** and **49** and seems to be interpreted directly as html in lines **44** and **55**.

### PoC

[![POC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26570201/295596307-5d4f563e-99c0-4981-a82e-fc42cfd902c5.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26570201/295596307-5d4f563e-99c0-4981-a82e-fc42cfd902c5.gif)

To reproduce the vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Edit an entry with a key\_value field.
2. Enter the following payload into the value field:

   `POC\"> <script>alert( 'XSS in key_value' );</script> <strong>Outside-tag</strong`
3. Save the entry.
4. Go to the index page and click on the eye icon next to the entry.

The malicious JavaScript code will be executed and an alert box will be displayed.

*On the show and edit page the alert seems not to pop up, but the strong tag breaks out of the expected html tag*

### Impact

This vulnerability could be used to steal sensitive information from victims that could be used to hijack victims' accounts or redirect them to malicious websites.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
