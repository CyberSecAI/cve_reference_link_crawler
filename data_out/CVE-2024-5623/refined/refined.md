- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An untrusted search path vulnerability in B&R APROL. Specifically, insufficient handling of search paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an untrusted search path issue, allowing for potential execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially get other users to execute arbitrary code under their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated local attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the APROL system. It also requires the attacker to trick another user into executing the malicious script.
