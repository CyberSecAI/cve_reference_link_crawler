Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular test-
ing with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasion-
ally an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product
cyber security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerabil-
ity handling process. This entails validating if the issue is in fact a product issue, identifying root causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide de-
tails on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that min-
imize the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a Cyber Security Advisory should not be mis-
construed as an affirmation or indication of an active threat or ongoing campaign targeting the
products mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the com-
munication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user commu-
nity in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust
we work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information
which is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

Vulnerability severity and details

Some vulnerabilities exist in the underlying operating system configuration and the Web application in-
cluded in the product versions listed above. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities
could insert and run arbitrary code with elevated privileges, or construct a hyperlink that, if issued by
another user, could execute malicious script code in the context of the user's browser session.

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) for both v3.11 and v4.02.

CVE-2024-5622

An untrusted search path vulnerability in the AprolConfigureCCServices of B&R APROL <= R 4.2-07P3 and
<= R 4.4-00P3 may allow an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privi-
leges.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score:
CVSS v3.1 Temporal Score:  6.8 (Medium)
CVSS v3.1 Vector:

7.8 (High)

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C

CVSS v4.0 Score

7.3 (High)

1 For the CVSS v3.1 scoring only the CVSS Base Score and the Temporal Score (if information is available) are considered in
this advisory. The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in this advisory
since it reflects the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’ computing environment; end-user
organizations are therefore recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental Score.

2 For the CVSS v4.0 scoring only the CVSS Base Metrics and the CVSS Supplemental Metrics (if information is available) are
considered in this advisory. The CVSS Environmental and Threat Metrics, which can affect the vulnerability severity, are not
provided in this advisory since they reflect the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’
computing environment and over time depending on the vulnerability exploit maturity. Therefore, end-user organizations
are recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental and Threat Metrics.

Workarounds and mitigating factors

Do not use hyperlinks provided by untrusted 3 rd party to access the Shift Logbook application. Hyper-
links may be provided via:

• Emails from unknown users

• Social media channels

• Messaging services

• Webpages with comment functionality

• QR Codes

The use of external Web Application Firewalls (WAF) can mitigate attacks using reflected cross-site
scripting.

To exploit the vulnerabilities CVE-2024-5623 and CVE-2024-5622, access with a low privileged account to
the APROL system is required. In general, limit any kind of access to the APROL system to trusted per-
sons.

Refer to section “General security recommendations” for further advise on how to keep your system se-
cure.

Frequently asked questions

What causes the vulnerabilities?

CVE Number

Exploitation example

CVE-2024-5622
CVE-2024-5623

The vulnerabilities are caused by insufficient handling of search paths in B&R
APROL.

CVE-2024-5624

The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during Web page
generation in B&R APROL.

What is B&R APROL?

B&R APROL is an industrial control system, which was developed as a homogeneous, integrated com-
plete system. Central engineering with a global engineering database allows completely consistent au-
tomation.

What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?

CVE Number

Exploitation example

CVE-2024-5622
CVE-2024-5623

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could insert and run arbi-
trary code.

CVE-2024-5624

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute malicious
script code in the context of the user's browser session.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?

CVE Number

Exploitation example

CVE-2024-5622
CVE-2024-5623

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerabilities by creating a specially crafted
malicious script and executing the script with higher privileges on a system node.

CVE-2024-5624

An attacker could construct a hyperlink that, if clicked by another user, could exe-
cute malicious script code in the context of the user's browser session.

Could the vulnerabilities be exploited remotely?

Yes, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit these vulnerabilities.
Recommended practices include that process control systems are physically protected, have no direct
connections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that
has a minimal number of ports exposed.

What does the update do?

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

The update removes the vulnerabilities by modifying how the B&R APROL uses file permissions, environ-
ment variables, and performs input sanitization.

When this security advisory was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly
disclosed?

No, B&R received information about these vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure.

When this security advisory was issued, had B&R received any reports that these
vulnerabilities was being exploited?

No, B&R had not received any information indicating that these vulnerabilities had been exploited when
this security advisory was originally issued.

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-ex-
haustive) list of cyber security practices:

–

–

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls
and separate them from any general-purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, periph-
eral equipment, and networks.

–  Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-

work other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

–  Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

–  Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

–  Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

–  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Rec-
ognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version availa-
ble. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
