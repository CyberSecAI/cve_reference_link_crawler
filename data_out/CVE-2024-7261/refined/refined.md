- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements in the "host" parameter within the CGI program of affected Zyxel APs and security routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the vulnerable device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted cookie containing malicious commands within the "host" parameter to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be positioned anywhere on the network where they can reach the device's web interface.
