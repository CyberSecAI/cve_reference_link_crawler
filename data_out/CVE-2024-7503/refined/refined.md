- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of loose comparison of the activation code in the `woo_slg_confirm_email_user` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any existing user, including an administrator, leading to complete account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker has access to a user's ID, and the email module is enabled in the plugin. The attacker can then manipulate the activation code during the login process using the loose comparison vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be unauthenticated, needs access to the userID, and the email module of the plugin must be enabled.
