Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper Access Control: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls within the Veritas Alta Recovery Vault feature of Veritas NetBackup. Specifically, a NetBackup administrator, who should not have had the ability, could modify the expiration of backups protected under Governance mode. This mode is intended to prevent premature deletion of backups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Incorrect permission assignment: A NetBackup administrator was granted the ability to modify retention lock settings, which should have been restricted to the cloud administrator role.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Premature Deletion of Backups: By modifying the expiration of backups under Governance mode, a NetBackup administrator could cause those backups to be deleted before their intended retention period. This could lead to data loss or compliance issues.
*   Circumvention of Governance Mode: The vulnerability allowed bypassing of the Governance mode's retention lock mechanism, undermining its intended purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network Access: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as indicated by the CVSS vector string component `AV:N`.
*   Exploitation requires a privileged account: The attacker needs to have "NetBackup Administrator" level privileges as indicated by the CVSS vector string component `PR:H`.
*   The attack is performed by interacting with the NetBackup server and modifying the expiration of Governance mode images in the cloud storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a NetBackup administrator.
*   The NetBackup server must be configured to use Veritas Alta Recovery Vault.
*   The attacker must access the NetBackup servers and perform the operation to modify the expiration of Governance mode images.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Veritas NetBackup versions 10.3.0.1, 10.3, 10.2.0.1, 10.2, 10.1.1, 10.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0, 9.1.0.1 and Veritas NetBackup Appliance versions 5.3.0.1, 5.3, 5.1.1, 5.0, 5.0.0.1, 4.1.0.1.
