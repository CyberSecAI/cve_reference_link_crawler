* 1.1: May 7, 2024: Added CVE ID

### Summary

A vulnerability was discovered in the Recovery Vault feature of Veritas NetBackup 10.3.0.1, and prior.  By design, only the cloud administrator should be able to disable the retention lock of Governance mode images.  This vulnerability allowed a NetBackup administrator to modify the expiration of backups under Governance mode which could cause premature deletion.

### Issue

CVE ID: [CVE-2024-34404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34404)

Severity: Medium

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 6.8   ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N))

CWE-284: Improper Access Control

**Prerequisites**

The NetBackup server has been configured to use Veritas Alta Recovery Vault (formerly known as NetBackup Recovery Vault) for cloud-based data retention services.  A user with the ‘NetBackup Administrator” role then accesses the NetBackup servers and performs the operation to modify the expiration of Governance mode images in the cloud storage.

Veritas NetBackup versions 10.3.0.1, 10.3, 10.2.0.1, 10.2, 10.1.1, 10.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0, 9.1.0.1

### Remediation

This vulnerability has already been remediated on all NetBackup Recovery Vault cloud endpoints.  Veritas NetBackup Recovery Vault customers who have installed the latest HotFix as described in the below TechNote do not need to take further actions. Customers who have not installed the latest HotFix must do so immediately for scheduled backups to continue.
