{
  "CVE-2024-24576": {
    "description": "The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the bat and cmd extensions) on Windows using the Command API. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping.",
    "affected_versions": "< 1.77.2",
    "patched_versions": "1.77.2",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The `cmd.exe` has its own argument splitting logic, forcing the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. The previous escaping logic was not thorough enough, allowing malicious arguments to bypass it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper argument escaping",
        "Command injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary shell command execution by an attacker who can control arguments passed to spawned batch file processes on Windows.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker provides malicious arguments to a program that executes batch files on Windows using the `std::process::Command` API.",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the arguments passed to the spawned process."
    },
     "mitigations": "The `Command` API now returns an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. The `CommandExt::raw_arg` method can be used to bypass the standard library's escaping logic for trusted inputs."
