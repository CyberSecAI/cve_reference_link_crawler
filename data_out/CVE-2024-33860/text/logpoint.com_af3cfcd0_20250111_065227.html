* [#### Surveil the IT infrastructure](#tab-86cf62cc52fb25149c3)
[![Surveil the IT infrastructure](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321314276.svg)](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321314276.svg)

From presence in endpoints to full cloud visibility. Logpoint SIEM comes with comprehensive observability across clients, servers, network systems, cloud workloads and business-critical applications. That way, you can demonstrate your security monitoring capabilities to insurers how your organization can detect a variety of attacks and advanced persistent threats.

* [#### Change compliance auditing](#tab-2d99272ee8725f7c66f)
[![Change compliance auditing](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537.svg)](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537.svg)

Insurers consider businesses that can’t meet regulations such as GDPR, NIS2, GPG 13, PCI, or many others, as high-risk, rising the costs of their policy. Don’t let that failure to comply increase your insurance premium. Logpoint comes with a pre-installed compliance dashboards for access management, incident management and perimeter security monitoring and alerts rules based on our taxonomy that helps you identify those logs related to compliance.

* [#### Secure your security data](#tab-81aaf6e2040ab2b3172)
[![Secure your security data](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-1.svg)](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-1.svg)

A good vulnerability management program sometimes is not enough for insurers to lower your risk. With a EAL3+ certified and SOC 2 Type II compliant provider like Logpoint, you represent lower risk, which in turns translates to a lower premium. You also have the peace of mind of knowing your data is safeguarded and your log management solution exceeds security-testing standards

* [#### Drive endpoint security](#tab-f00abef4e2f8c373c8b)
[![Drive endpoint security](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-2.svg)](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-2.svg)

Because almost all breaches begin in endpoints, complete endpoint observability is vital — it helps reduce incident response times by containing attacks earlier. This is often a determining factor to qualify for cyber insurance. Not an issue with Logpoint. Stay on top of your endpoint security with full observability and automatic endpoint scanning and reporting of CIS controls.

* [#### Boost incident response](#tab-8480eff950e54826c80)
[![Boost incident response](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-3.svg)](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315537-3.svg)

For insurers, a good response and triage process is as important as your detection. Logpoint comes with pre-configured playbooks that automate the investigation, containment, and removal of threats. Timely response will help you minimize the consequences of an incident, but also lower risk in the eyes of your insurer.

#### SIEM VS. XDR: FUNCTIONAL COVERAGE

## Beyond threat detection, investigation, and response

While XDR solutions focus solely on TDIR, Logpoint brings compliance, operations monitoring, reporting, and extended log storage to the table.

To comply with the latest mandates a yearly compliance check is not enough. Logpoint SIEM goes beyond that and categorizes events related to different regulatory frameworks. No more brute-forcing your log management tool to get the data you need for compliance reporting.

![Functional Coverage](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/changing-the-game-dark-1.png)

* [#### Customization](#tab-b1d073c6b725a3828de)
#### SIEM VS. XDR: CUSTOMIZATION

## No more one-size-fits-all alerts, analysis, and rules

If you need high customization and control over rules and alerts, XDR solutions fall short.

Get unlimited customization for threat detection content and dashboards​ with Logpoint. It offers greater flexibility in creating tailor-made rules and analyzing data from various sources beyond security, addressing specific threats and potential compliance incidents.

![Customization](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/manufacturing-dark-1.png)

* [#### Data Storage](#tab-89cdc446b3eab782dc5)
#### SIEM VS. XDR: DATA STORAGE

## Take forensics to the next level

Storing data for longer periods is crucial for post-incident investigations and compliance requirements. While XDR comes with some forensic capabilities, it’s not suitable for long-term data storage and in-depth historical analysis.

Store your content all the time you need with Logpoint. For companies with long-term vision who look for long-term effectiveness.

![Data Storage](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/dashboards-2-dark-1.png)

* [#### Deployment](#tab-504aeed691fb19d1338)
#### SIEM VS. XDR: DEPLOYMENT

## Don’t condition your security to your solution’s deployment

Server deployment, SaaS, or private cloud. We got you, no matter the delivery model you need for your use cases.

If you are handling highly sensitive data or need to adhere to industry-specific compliance regulations, Logpoint’s server deployment is EAL 3+ certified. Do you want us to host and manage your platform? Do it with ease, our SaaS solutions are SOC 2 Type II compliant.

![Deployment](https://www.logpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/group-1321315533.png)

* [#### Automation](#tab-deab2f7b937285680b0)
#### SIEM VS. XDR: AUTOMATION

## Reduce the mean time to investigate and respond

Certainly, XDR solutions stand out in automating threat response actions, however Logpoint pairs the flexibility of creating custom rules and historical data with automated playbooks for investigation and response.

With these highly customizable orchestration capabilities, you get faster incident resolution and reduce the burden on limited security teams.
