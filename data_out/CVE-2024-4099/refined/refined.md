Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from GitLab AI features using unsanitized data as input for generating summaries and responses. This contrasts with the sanitized data displayed to users in the UI. Specifically, the AI processes raw content (including HTML tags) from comments, descriptions, and other data, while the UI filters out potentially harmful elements using DOMPurify and Banzai filters for Markdown.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prompt Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious prompts within HTML tags (e.g., `<script>`) in comments, issue descriptions, or through the Service Desk email. These prompts are not visible in the user interface due to sanitization.
*   **Unsanitized Input for AI:** The AI models process the raw, unsanitized input, making them vulnerable to the injected prompts, causing them to generate outputs influenced by the attacker's instructions.
*   **Discrepancy in Data Handling:** A critical vulnerability is the difference in how data is processed for display vs AI usage, leading to the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Control over AI Responses:** Attackers can manipulate the AI-generated content. This includes controlling summary outputs, injecting phishing links, or any other content desired by the attacker.
*   **Manipulation of User Experience:** Since users view sanitized content but the AI processes raw content, the AI can present misleading or malicious information, causing confusion.
*   **Phishing and Spam:** Attackers can use this to redirect users to malicious URLs or spam them, by manipulating the AI responses.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comments and Descriptions:** Injecting malicious HTML tags within comments or descriptions on issues, merge requests, or other relevant entities.
*   **Service Desk Email:** Sending specially crafted emails through the Service Desk feature to inject malicious content into issues created. This allows for unauthenticated exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Account (optional):** While a GitLab account is helpful, the attack can be performed by any unauthenticated user using the Service Desk email functionality.
*   **Ability to Submit Content:** The attacker needs to be able to submit or have content submitted to GitLab, either by commenting or using the service desk.
*   **Knowledge of HTML tags:** The attacker needs to know how to embed commands in HTML tags to manipulate the AI.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific examples, steps to reproduce, and a detailed analysis of the impact.
*   The attacker can effectively control what AI responds to the user, rendering the AI potentially unreliable.
*   The attacker can inject a prompt that tells the bot to execute specific instructions, and have it do things such as present a specific phrase.
