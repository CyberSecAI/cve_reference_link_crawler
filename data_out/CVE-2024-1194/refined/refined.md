- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the AlienIP 2.41 software when processing input in the IP address or country field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer Overflow. The application does not properly validate the size of the input it receives, resulting in a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). By providing an overly long input string, an attacker can crash the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered when the user pastes a specially crafted long string into the "IP address or Country" input field and then initiates a lookup via button press.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a long string of 'A' characters and has to be able to paste the exploit string into the application's input field. User interaction is required for the exploit to be triggered.
