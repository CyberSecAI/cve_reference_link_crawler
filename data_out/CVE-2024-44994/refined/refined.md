Based on the provided content, both commits (cc6bc2ab1663ec9353636416af22452b078510e9 and fca5b78511e98bdff2cdd55c172b23200a7b3404) address the same issue, which is a missing return statement in the `iommu_report_device_fault` function within the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A missing `return` statement was accidentally deleted in the `iommu_report_device_fault` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When `iommu_report_device_fault` is called with a partial fault, it should collect the fault into the group and then return. Without the return statement, the function continues execution, leading to incorrect fault processing and a potential crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The lack of the return statement leads to a crash due to the fault being processed incorrectly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an IOMMU device fault that results in a call to `iommu_report_device_fault` with a partial fault. This is not a direct exploit, but a condition that can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause an IOMMU device fault, which likely requires a malicious or misbehaving device driver or hardware. This could be done through a root-level process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix is a single line addition, a `return;` statement.
- The bug was introduced by commit `3dfa64aecbaf` which changed the function to return void. The missing return was a typo during this change.
- The provided context seems to indicate that this patch has been applied to the Linux Kernel stable tree.
