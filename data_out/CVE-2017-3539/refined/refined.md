  "CVE-2017-3539": {
    "description": "The Security component of OpenJDK did not allow users to restrict the set of algorithms allowed for Jar integrity verification. This flaw could allow an attacker to modify content of the Jar file that used weak signing key or hash algorithm.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of a mechanism to restrict the algorithms used for JAR file integrity verification, specifically, the use of MD5 for JAR verification was permitted.",
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially modify the contents of JAR files that use weak signing keys or hashing algorithms.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker would need to modify a signed JAR file, and then rely on a vulnerable Java application using the affected JRE/JDK to execute that modified JAR file without detecting the tampering.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to modify JAR files and cause them to be executed by a Java application. The attacker does not require network access or user interaction."
