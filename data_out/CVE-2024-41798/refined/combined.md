Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-850560: Use of 4-Digit PIN in SENTRON PAC3200 Devices

| Publication Date: | 2024-10-08 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-10-08 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 9.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 9.3 |

SUMMARY

SENTRON PAC3200 only provide a 4-digit PIN to protect from administrative access via Modbus TCP interface. Attackers with access to the Modbus TCP interface could easily bypass this protection by brute-force attacks or by monitoring the Modbus cleartext communication.

Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| SENTRON 7KM PAC3200  All versions affected by [CVE-2024-41798](#cve-2024-41798) | Currently no fix is planned  Consider the PIN as protection against unauthorized operation (i.e., protection against inadvertent operating errors), not as protection against malicious access attempts, such as through brute-force attacks; for details see the FAQ article at <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109975235/> |

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-41798

Affected devices only provide a 4-digit PIN to protect from administrative access via Modbus TCP interface. Attackers with access to the Modbus TCP interface could easily bypass this protection by brute-force attacks or by sniffing the Modbus clear text communication.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Siemens thanks the following party for its efforts:

* Michael Messner and Benedikt KÃ¼hne from Siemens Energy for reporting the vulnerability

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The successor product SENTRON 7KM PAC3220 provides an additional hardware switch, that disables administrative write access; only read access is possible from remote. Additionally an extended protection against brute-force attacks is implemented.
