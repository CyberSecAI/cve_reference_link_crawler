## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2021-09-24: Report sent to `steve.springett AT owasp.org`
* 2022-02-13: Issue fixed in [1.10.4](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine/releases/tag/alpine-parent-1.10.4)

## Summary

The `AuthenticationFilter` can be bypassed

## Product

Alpine

## Tested Version

[1.10.2](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine/releases/tag/alpine-parent-1.10.2)

## Details

### Issue: AuthenticationFilter bypass (`GHSL-2021-1010`)

The [AuthenticationFilter](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine/blob/f03dbda46229c26145a5f9f7f2660cc2c386be02/alpine/src/main/java/alpine/filters/AuthenticationFilter.java#L58-L60) relies on the request URI to evaluate if the user is accessing the swagger endpoint:

```
            if (request.getRequestUri().getPath().contains("/api/swagger")) {
                return;
            }

```

By accessing a URL with a path such as `/api/foo;%2fapi%2fswagger` the `contains` condition will hold and will return from the authentication filter without aborting the request. Note that the principal object will not be assigned and therefore the issue wont allow user impersonation.

#### Impact

The issue may lead to authentication bypass
