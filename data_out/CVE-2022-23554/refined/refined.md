Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check within the `AuthenticationFilter` of the Alpine application. The filter uses `request.getRequestUri().getPath().contains("/api/swagger")` to determine if a request is for the swagger endpoint, which should bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The use of `contains()` allows for a bypass by crafting a URL containing `/api/swagger` anywhere within the path. For example, `/api/foo;%2fapi%2fswagger` will match, despite not being the swagger endpoint.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The filter doesn't properly validate or normalize the request path before checking for the presence of `/api/swagger`. This allows the injection of the string within the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication filter and access protected resources without proper authorization by crafting a specific URI.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** While the provided information states that user impersonation is not possible due to the principal object not being assigned, unauthenticated access is still a critical security issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed URL:** An attacker crafts a URL that includes `/api/swagger` string, but the rest of the URL points to protected API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Alpine application.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.10.4 of Alpine.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a member of the GitHub Security Lab.
