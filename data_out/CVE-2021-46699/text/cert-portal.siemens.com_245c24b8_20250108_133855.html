SUMMARY

Siemens Simcenter Femap versions before V2022.1.1 are affected by vulnerabilities that could be
triggered when the application reads ﬁles in .NEU or .BDF format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious
ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to leak information or
potentially perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version line of Simcenter Femap and to avoid opening of
untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not open untrusted NEU or BDF ﬁles in Simcenter Femap

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Simcenter Femap is an advanced simulation application for creating, editing, and inspecting ﬁnite element
models of complex products or systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-46162

Affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted NEU ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-15048)
