- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer. This is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when accessing memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Information disclosure through a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file). The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file with the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a malicious file that is opened by the user on their local machine with the vulnerable software.
