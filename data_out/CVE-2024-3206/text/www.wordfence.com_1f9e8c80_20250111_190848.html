### Description

The Different Menu in Different Pages – Control Menu Visibility (All in One) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to duplicate menus.
