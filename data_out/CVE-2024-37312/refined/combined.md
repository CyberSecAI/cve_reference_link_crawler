# ID4me feature of OpenID connect app available even when disabled

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-vw7g-959g-vj6q
Jun 14, 2024

## Package

User OIDC
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

<= 1.3.6

## Patched versions

3.0.0, 4.0.0, 5.0.0

## Description

### Impact

Missing access control on the ID4me endpoint allows an attacker to register an account eventually getting access to data that is available to all registered users.

### Patches

It is recommended that the OpenID Connect user backend is upgraded to 3.0.0 (Nextcloud 20-23), 4.0.0 (Nexcloud 24) or 5.0.0 (Nextcloud 25-28)

### Workarounds

* Disable app user\_oidc

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/2376929)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/user_oidc/commit/9f68a716ecd264160a7c098b8840313f1ac855f2)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
