The provided content relates to a fix for a potential overrun issue in the AMD GPU display driver, specifically when the number of display streams exceeds the maximum allowed. This fix is associated with the upstream commit `84723eb6068c50610c5c0893980d230d7afa2105`.  The fix was backported into multiple stable kernel branches.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The code was not checking if the number of primary planes (equal to the maximum number of display streams) exceeded the maximum supported value (`AMDGPU_MAX_PLANES`, which is 6).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of a check on `primary_planes` against `AMDGPU_MAX_PLANES` before proceeding with initialization. This could lead to an overrun if `primary_planes` was greater than 6.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A potential overrun and subsequent crash or undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds memory access if the number of streams exceeds the maximum allowed.
- **Attack vectors**: This isn't directly exploitable by an attacker in a traditional sense. The vulnerability is present within the driver's initialization process, triggered by system configuration or hardware capabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need to control the system configuration/hardware to set up more display streams than supported which is not a usual attack scenario.
