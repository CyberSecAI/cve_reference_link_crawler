| * I reported this vulnerability on huntr.dev but had not got a response for a week, so I think maybe disclosing it here is easier to keep in touch.  Description Recently I have been reviewing CVEs, checking whether there are cognate/recurring bugs as known ones. While reviewing VIM, I found one quite similar to [CVE-2023-0512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whp8-xgvp-xj3v "CVE-2023-0512").  The [CVE-2023-0512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whp8-xgvp-xj3v "CVE-2023-0512") is an issue where VIM under ex mode falsely caculated the width of current window. In `scroll_cursor_bot` caculates the `topline` and `bottomline` likely, only in normal visual mode. In the [caculation](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/move.c#L2593), `width1` is assigned the width of current window minus widths of linenumber and foldcolumn, which can be negative. If `foldcolumen` is on, then `width2` can be assigned `0`, resulting in a Divide-by-zero fault in the following division.
