| * I reported this vulnerability on huntr.dev but had not got a response for a week, so I think maybe disclosing it here is easier to keep in touch.  Description Recently I have been reviewing CVEs, checking whether there are cognate/recurring bugs as known ones. While reviewing VIM, I found one quite similar to [CVE-2023-0512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whp8-xgvp-xj3v "CVE-2023-0512").  The [CVE-2023-0512](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whp8-xgvp-xj3v "CVE-2023-0512") is an issue where VIM under ex mode falsely caculated the width of current window. In `scroll_cursor_bot` caculates the `topline` and `bottomline` likely, only in normal visual mode. In the [caculation](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/src/move.c#L2593), `width1` is assigned the width of current window minus widths of linenumber and foldcolumn, which can be negative. If `foldcolumen` is on, then `width2` can be assigned `0`, resulting in a Divide-by-zero fault in the following division.

| Please fix test\_codestyle (move the "{" to the next line).  In the test, I wonder why you need to disable "wait\_for\_ruler"? It makes the test less reliable. In that same place, why use 19 rows? Can't we use something smaller, e.g. 10 rows? |

| Hi, code style has been fixed :)  As for the `wait_for_ruler` option, I just kept it as same as the test for [the fix of CVE-2023-0512](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/870219c58c0804bdc55419b2e455c06ac715a835#diff-17dac4fdd8926bdb22216329564bd749993e58279bc31b46668c09da5c3e3faaR580). I did made an experiment, though, that without disabling `wait_for_ruler`, the single test would take 5 secs and fail. Not sure whether this is because `vsplit` is on or `-g -O0` is configured in my experimental environment. After disabling it the test passes fine.  As for the 19 rows, well, it is an experimental value. In this specific, I need to ensure the curwin width is smaller than the line-number column width, so I put more than 10 empty lines there, and it worked. |
