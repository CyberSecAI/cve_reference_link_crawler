- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection due to missing server-side input sanitization when loading SNMP configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically command injection (CWE-77).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by sending malicious input via SNMP configuration loading.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the right to modify the SNMP configuration.
