A vulnerability has been identified in SINEMA Remote Connect Server (All versions < V3.2 HF1). Affected applications are vulnerable to command injection due to missing server side input sanitation when loading SNMP configurations. This could allow an attacker with the right to modify the SNMP configuration to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
