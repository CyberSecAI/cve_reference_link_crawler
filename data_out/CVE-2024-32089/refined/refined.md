- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to, under their existing authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions exposed to CSRF.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a request that appears to come from a legitimate user and trick the victim into triggering it by visiting a crafted web page or by other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into executing a malicious request. The attacker does not need any authentication for the vulnerable plugin.
