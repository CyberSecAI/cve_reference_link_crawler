# heap-use-after-free alist\_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678

Moderate

[chrisbra](/chrisbra)
published
GHSA-2w8m-443v-cgvw
Aug 15, 2024

## Package

Vim

## Affected versions

< v9.1.0677

## Patched versions

v9.1.0678

## Description

# use-after-free in alist\_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678

**Date:** 15.08.2024

**Severity:** Low

**CVE:** CVE-2024-43374

**CWE:** Use After Free (CWE-416)

### Summary

Vim < v9.1.0678 has a use-after-free error in argument list handling

### Impact

When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*`

autocommands. If in such an autocommand the buffer that was just opened

is closed (including the window where it is shown), this causes the

window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument

list that we are actually modifying.

So once the autocommands are completed, the refernces to the window and

argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free.

Therefore, lock the current window, so that functions trying to close

the window will return an error and the reference to the current argument list

remains valid.

Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some un-usual

autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by sourcing

a malicious plugin) but it will crash Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting this

issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Message-ID: <Zr5k9jjqTfWtADCB@256bit.org>

From: Christian Brabandt <cb@...bit.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: [vim-security] use-after-free in alist_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678

use-after-free in alist_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678
================================================
Date: 15.08.2024
Severity: Low
CVE: CVE-2024-43374
CWE: Use After Free (CWE-416)

When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*`
autocommands. If such an autocommand wipes the buffer that was just
opened (including the window where it is shown), it causes the
window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument
list that was supposed to be modified.

So once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and
argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free.

Therefore, lock the current window, so that functions trying to close
the window will return an error and the reference to the current
argument list remains valid.

Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some un-usual
autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by
sourcing a malicious plugin) but it will most-likely crash Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting
this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678
