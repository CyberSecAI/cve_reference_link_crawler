Subject: [vim-security] use-after-free in alist_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678

use-after-free in alist_add() in Vim < v9.1.0678
================================================
Date: 15.08.2024
Severity: Low
CVE: CVE-2024-43374
CWE: Use After Free (CWE-416)

When adding a new file to the argument list, this triggers `Buf*`
autocommands. If such an autocommand wipes the buffer that was just
opened (including the window where it is shown), it causes the
window structure to be freed which contains a reference to the argument
list that was supposed to be modified.

So once the autocommands are completed, the references to the window and
argument list are no longer valid and as such cause an use-after-free.

Therefore, lock the current window, so that functions trying to close
the window will return an error and the reference to the current
argument list remains valid.

Impact is low since the user must either intentionally add some un-usual
autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation (either manually or by
sourcing a malicious plugin) but it will most-likely crash Vim.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting
this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0678
