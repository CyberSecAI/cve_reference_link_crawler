- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Payment Gateway Based Fees and Discounts for WooCommerce plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft malicious requests that, when triggered by a logged-in user, could lead to unauthorized actions within the WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) into unknowingly triggering a malicious request. This is typically achieved through social engineering techniques like phishing.
