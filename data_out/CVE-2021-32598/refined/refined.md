Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper neutralization of CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in HTTP headers. This is a classic HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI fails to properly sanitize or encode CRLF sequences within HTTP headers. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers and content into the HTTP response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform an HTTP request splitting attack. This means the attacker can gain control of the remaining headers and the body of the response.
- This could lead to various attacks such as:
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the attacker injects malicious scripts into the response body.
  - Cache poisoning, by injecting headers that alter caching behavior.
  - Session hijacking, by injecting session cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer GUI.
- The attack vector is HTTP.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FortiManager or FortiAnalyzer system.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate input that is used to construct HTTP headers in the application’s response.
