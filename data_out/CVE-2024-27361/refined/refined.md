Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- TOCTOU race condition: This occurs when there is a discrepancy between the time a resource is checked for a certain condition (e.g., if a file exists, permissions are valid) and the time the resource is actually used. During this window, another process can modify the resource, leading to unexpected or insecure behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of the race condition can lead to a denial of service, making the affected system or service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The provided text does not specify the exact attack vector but indicates that the vulnerability exists in several Exynos processors. The attack likely involves manipulating system resources or data structures that are accessed in a time-sensitive manner.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position where they can interact with the affected system and race against the vulnerable check. This likely requires local access or, in some cases, the ability to execute code on the system.

**Affected Products/Versions**
- Exynos 980, Exynos 990, Exynos 1080, Exynos 2100, Exynos 2200, Exynos 1280, Exynos 1380, Exynos 2400
