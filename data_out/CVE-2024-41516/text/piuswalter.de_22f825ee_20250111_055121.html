Overview of the versions of CADClick used from 07/08/2024

### Reflected XSS on Various Endpoints (CVE-2024-41513, CVE-2024-41514, CVE-2024-4151, CVE-2024-41516)

CADClick is developed in C# using the ASP.NET web application framework. The following endpoints have been identified as vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks:

* `Artikel.aspx` (parameter `searchindex`) (CVE-2024-41513)
* `PrevPgGroup.aspx` (parameter `wer`) (CVE-2024-41514)
* `ccHandlerResource.ashx` (parameter `res_url`) (CVE-2024-41515)
* `ccHandler.aspx` (parameter `bomid`) (CVE-2024-41516)

The image below demonstrates the reflected XSS vulnerability on the `Artikel.aspx` endpoint. The payload `<script>alert(location.hostname)</script>` can be used to exploit this flaw. It’s important to note that this vulnerability is not present in all versions of CADClick.

Reflected XSS on the `Artikel.aspx` endpoint

The same vulnerability applies to the `PrevPgGroup.aspx` endpoint. The same payload, `<script>alert(location.hostname)</script>`, can be used here as well. However, like the previous example, this endpoint is only vulnerable in specific versions of CADClick.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-2-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-2.png)

Reflected XSS on the `PrevPgGroup.aspx` endpoint

The image below displays a version of CADClick that is not susceptible to the vulnerability. In this version, special characters such as `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `;`, `'`, and `"` are automatically replaced with underscores (`_`), preventing the XSS exploit.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-3-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-3.png)

Fixed Reflected XSS on the `PrevPgGroup.aspx` endpoint

The `ccHandlerResource.ashx` endpoint, specifically with the parameter `res_url` is also vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-4-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-4.png)

Reflected XSS on the `ccHandlerResource.ashx` endpoint

The `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint is vulnerable to multiple security issues, including Reflected XSS and SQL Injection attacks. When accessed without parameters, it reveals available and vulnerable parameters, providing insight into potential exploitation points.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-5-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-5.png)

Loaded the `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint without parameters

Testing with the BoM ID using the guessed parameter `bomid` and a slightly adjusted payload proves successful. This demonstrates the endpoint’s vulnerability to the Reflected XSS attack.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-6-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-6.png)

Reflected XSS on the `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint

After confirming the pop-up window, an intriguing error message appeared. The space in the error message revealed the SVG, which was inserted with the payload. More notably, the error indicated a SQL syntax issue near the character `'`. This raises the possibility of an additional vulnerability in the application.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-7-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-7.png)

Via Reflected XSS loaded SVG on the `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint

### SQL Injection Possibilities (CVE-2024-41512)

SQL Injection attacks are also effective. As noted earlier, this vulnerability impacts numerous customers. During an assessment of other clients, a case was found with extensive logging enabled. This logging not only displays the SQL query but also specifies the exact location of the error on the server, providing insights into the directory structure used. A closer examination reveals important details.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-8-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-8.png)

SQL error on the `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint

By appending the payload `and 1=2 union all select concat_ws(0x3a,version(),user(),database())` to the previous URL, an error message was generated. This indicates that the SQL query was successfully appended to the original query.

Unfortunately, explicit output of information regarding the endpoints was not achievable at this time. It would be advisable for the manufacturer to conduct further investigation into this matter.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-9-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-9.png)

SQL Injection on the `ccHandler.aspx` endpoint

### Path Traversal (Local File Inclusion) Vulnerability (CVE-2024-41511)

Subsequent examination of the web application aimed to identify additional endpoints where vulnerabilities might exist. This leads to the discovery of a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which can be exploited through the `BinaryFileRedirector.ashx` endpoint using the `path` parameter.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-10-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-10.png)

Web requests when loading the web application

When the request shown in the above screenshot is made, the specified image provided as a parameter is returned and subsequently downloaded by the web browser.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-11-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-11.png)

Download of an image using the `BinaryFileRedirector.ashx` endpoint

The next logical step involves attempting to access system files through the endpoint. This is illustrated below using the paths `C:\Windows\win.ini` and `C:\Windows\system.ini`. As demonstrated, this method allows for the reading of system files.

[![](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-12-1024x576.png)](https://piuswalter.de/wp-content/uploads/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-cadclick-12.png)

Access to system files via the `BinaryFileredirector.ashx` endpoint

At this point, it is concluded that further testing of the web application is unwarranted, at least until the manufacturer addresses and rectifies the known vulnerabilities across all endpoints. However, numerous indications suggest that the application harbors many other vulnerabilities, potentially including artificial ones, which could be exploited to compromise the underlying system for at least 32 customers.

## What’s the Outcome?

The findings from this investigation underscore significant security risks associated with the CADClick web application, including multiple critical vulnerabilities. Despite attempts to engage with the manufacturer, no communication has been received, leaving some of these issues unresolved. The lack of response highlights a concerning trend in vulnerability management, emphasizing the necessity for proactive security measures in software development. It is imperative for developers to prioritize the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust.
