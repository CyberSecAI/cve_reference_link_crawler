{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing Data Node jobs. Specifically, the issue results in a read past the end of an array.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of array index leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, this can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the service account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability without authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and does not need any prior authentication."
