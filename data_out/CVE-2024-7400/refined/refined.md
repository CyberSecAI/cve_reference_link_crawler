- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file operations handling during the removal of a detected file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists, allowing an attacker to misuse ESET's file operations during the removal of a detected file. This leads to the ability to delete files without proper permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with low-privileged code execution can delete arbitrary files, thereby escalating their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
