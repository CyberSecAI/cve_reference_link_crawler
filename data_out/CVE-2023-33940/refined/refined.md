Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue arising from unsanitized input within the IFrame URL of Remote Apps.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    * **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored within the application and executed when other users access the affected functionality.
    * **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the IFrame URL, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to:
    * **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    * **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive data within the application.
    * **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the application.
    * **Malware delivery:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
* **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious code via the Remote App's IFrame URL.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges to configure the IFrame type Remote App URL. Specifically, the attacker needs to be a user with high permissions (PR:H) within the Liferay Portal or DXP instance to configure a Remote App with a malicious IFrame URL. The attack also requires user interaction (UI:R) as the malicious script will be executed when another user views the page containing the vulnerable IFrame.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 31 and Liferay Portal versions 7.4.0 through 7.4.3.30
*   **Fixed Versions:** Liferay DXP 7.4 update 31 and Liferay Portal 7.4.3.31
*   **CVSS Score:** 4.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) indicating a medium severity. The vectors indicate:
    *   **AV:N:** Network attack vector
    *   **AC:L:** Low attack complexity
    *   **PR:H:** High privileges required
    *  **UI:R:** User interaction required
    *   **S:C:** Scope changed
    *   **C:L:** Low Confidentiality impact
    *   **I:L:** Low Integrity impact
    *   **A:N:** No Availability impact
