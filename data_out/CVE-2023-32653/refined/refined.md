The content is related to CVE-2023-32653.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer underflow in the `dcm_pixel_data_decode` function within the Accusoft ImageGear library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Integer underflow (CWE-191)
*   Out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Specifically, a large value for `esi` is calculated due to an integer underflow, and this value is used as an offset to write to the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution by overwriting parts of the stack with attacker-controlled values.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Opening a specially crafted, malformed DICOM file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to create or modify a DICOM file.
*   Ability to convince a victim to open the malicious DICOM file using a vulnerable application (Accusoft ImageGear 20.1).
