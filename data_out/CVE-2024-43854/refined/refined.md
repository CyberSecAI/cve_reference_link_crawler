The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's block layer data integrity support.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `bio_integrity_prep` function allocates memory for metadata using `kmalloc` without initializing it to zero. This results in uninitialized kernel memory being written to the storage media.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** Uninitialized kernel memory, which could contain sensitive data, is written to the disk.
- This is present both for PI (Protection Information) metadata and non-PI metadata, with the leak being limited to the app tag for PI but affecting the entire buffer for non-PI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read the leaked kernel memory from the storage media.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any operation that uses the block layer's data integrity feature, which involves writing to a block device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to read data written to block devices where data integrity metadata is being used.
- This could be achieved via physical access to the storage media or logical access if the attacker can read the block device.

**More Detail than CVE description:**
- The provided commit messages and diffs offer specific details including the affected function (`bio_integrity_prep`), the allocation type `kmalloc`, and the fix implemented by adding `__GFP_ZERO` to the allocation flags. The text also makes the distinction between the impact on PI and non-PI metadata, with PI leaks limited to the app tag only.
