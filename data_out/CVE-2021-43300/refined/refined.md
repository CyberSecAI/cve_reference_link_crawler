Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-43300:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the PJSUA API within the `pjsua_recorder_create` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `filename` argument, controlled by the attacker, is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper size validation. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.
*   **Missing Size Validation:** The code lacks a check on the length of the filename before copying it to the stack buffer. This is the core weakness enabling the overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful stack buffer overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** Even if arbitrary code execution isn't achieved, a buffer overflow can cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `filename` argument passed to the `pjsua_recorder_create` function.
*   This could be achieved through malicious input provided via an application using the vulnerable library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to make the application call `pjsua_recorder_create` with a crafted, overly long, filename.
*   This implies the attacker must have some form of access to the application's input mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue also has a related out-of-bounds read vulnerability when using a filename shorter than 4 characters in `pjsua_recorder_create`.
*   The vulnerability is present in `pjproject` versions 2.11.1 and below, and fixed in version 2.12 and later.
*   The advisory also mentions the same type of vulnerability impacting `pjsua_player_create` and `pjsua_playlist_create` functions.
*   A workaround is to validate the length of the filename before calling the vulnerable functions.

In summary, CVE-2021-43300 describes a stack buffer overflow in the `pjsua_recorder_create` function of `pjproject` due to missing size validation on the filename, potentially leading to code execution or denial-of-service. The attacker needs to be able to control the filename parameter.
