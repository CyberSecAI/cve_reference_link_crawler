Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14725:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies within the Oracle MySQL server. Specifically, versions up to 8.0.20 are susceptible to a flaw that can lead to a hang or a frequently repeatable crash.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a vulnerability in the MySQL server code that can be triggered by specific operations, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can cause a hang or a frequently repeatable crash, resulting in a partial or complete Denial of Service (DoS) of the MySQL server. This disrupts normal database operations.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through network interaction with the vulnerable MySQL server instance. The specific way in which a crafted query leads to the crash is not explained.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable MySQL server.
*   According to NetApp, a successful attack may require a high level of privileges, however, Oracle states "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server."
*   The Gentoo advisory does not specify the required privileges but notes that the vulnerability can be exploited locally or remotely

**Additional Notes:**

*   The NetApp advisory highlights the affected products, which include:
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory provides a list of affected and unaffected versions of mysql and mysql-connector-c.
*   The Oracle advisory indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. It also states that a successful attack can lead to unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.
*   The advisory from Oracle also lists a large number of affected products that use MySQL.
*   The NetApp advisory provides a remediation path, recommending an upgrade to the listed versions to resolve the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-14725 describes a vulnerability in MySQL servers (versions up to 8.0.20), where a malicious actor can cause a DoS condition, causing the server to crash or hang. The NetApp and Gentoo advisories provide information on affected products and versions, while Oracle details the overall impact of the flaw in their extensive advisory.
