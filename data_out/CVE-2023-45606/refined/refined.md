- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Simple URLs Plugin <= 120 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack is based on a CSRF vulnerability, meaning that the attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that triggers the CSRF attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
