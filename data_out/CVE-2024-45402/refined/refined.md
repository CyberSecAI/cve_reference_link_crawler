The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A double free vulnerability exists in picotls due to incorrect memory management when handling spoofed TLS handshake messages, specifically during the disposal of multiple objects without intervening calls to malloc.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The same memory is freed twice, which can lead to a crash or potentially a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The double free can trigger a crash due to the malloc implementation detecting the error and aborting the process.
- Potential Use-After-Free: Depending on the malloc implementation and crypto backend used, the double free could lead to a use-after-free scenario, which could allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted (spoofed) TLS handshake message over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a service using the vulnerable picotls library. No special privileges are required, nor does the attack require any user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a spoofed TLS handshake message.
- The vulnerability exists in the bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries.
- The vulnerability was patched in commit `9b88159` and above in the `picotls` repository.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Kian Kai Ang ([@QUICTester](https://github.com/QUICTester)).
