Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-32660:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Uncontrolled search path in the Intel(R) NUC Kit NUC6i7KYK Thunderbolt(TM) 3 Firmware Update Tool installation software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The software installer uses an uncontrolled search path. This means it might search for required files in locations that an attacker could control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Escalation of privilege. An attacker can potentially gain higher privileges on the system than they should have.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access. The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable software installation.
- The vulnerability requires user interaction as specified by the "UI:R" parameter in the CVSS vector string.

**Additional details:**

- The specific software affected is the Intel(R) NUC Kit NUC6i7KYK Thunderbolt(TM) 3 Firmware Update Tool installation software before version 46.
- The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity with a CVSS base score of 6.7.
- The provided CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` which translates to:
    - **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local)
    - **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High)
    - **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    - **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
    - **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    - **C:H** (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    - **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High)
    - **A:H** (Availability Impact: High)
- Intel recommends updating the software to the latest version (version 46 or later) to mitigate this vulnerability.
