### Summary:
The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-1384. This CVE relates to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the "Premium Portfolio Features for Phlox theme" WordPress plugin, specifically within the `aux_recent_portfolios_grid` shortcode.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `aux_recent_portfolios_grid` shortcode.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the `aux_recent_portfolios_grid` shortcode attributes. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed within the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected pages.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Arbitrary script execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when users visit pages containing the vulnerable shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the user's browser context.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the website.
    - **Malware distribution:**  Injecting code that attempts to install malware on user machines.
- **Privilege escalation:**  An attacker might be able to use XSS to gain access to higher-level admin accounts through social engineering.

### Attack vectors:
- **Shortcode injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript within the attributes of the `aux_recent_portfolios_grid` shortcode.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the website's database and served to users visiting pages containing the shortcode.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress site.
- **Shortcode access:** The attacker must be able to add or modify content that uses shortcodes, including `aux_recent_portfolios_grid`.

### Additional details:
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.3.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.5.
- The file `recent-portfolios.php` shows the shortcode definition.
