*   It describes a "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software Web Services Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability."
*   The description aligns with a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
*   This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by "improper input validation when parsing HTTPS requests" within the web services interface of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of incoming HTTPS requests. This allows for the injection of malicious data that is not correctly handled, leading to a crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service condition. This disrupts the availability of the services provided by the device.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who is able to send network traffic to the affected device.
*   **Crafted HTTPS Requests:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS request to the device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to send HTTPS requests to the target device.

**Additional Information from the Security Advisory:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software that have vulnerable remote access VPN configurations enabled. This includes AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services), AnyConnect SSL VPN and Clientless SSL VPN.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released free software updates to address the vulnerability. The advisory includes detailed tables of the affected and fixed software releases for both ASA and FTD.
*   **No Public Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory publication, the Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*  **Source of the vulnerability** The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case and further reported by Saleh Iskandar.
*   **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score is 7.5, classified as High Severity.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-20745 is a high-severity vulnerability in Cisco ASA and FTD software that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted HTTPS requests. This is due to improper input validation, and there are no workarounds available. Customers are strongly advised to upgrade their software to patched versions provided by Cisco.
