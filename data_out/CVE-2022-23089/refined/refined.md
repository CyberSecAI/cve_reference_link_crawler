Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23089

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how FreeBSD handles process information ("prpsinfo") when creating a core dump, specifically within the `elf_note_prpsinfo()` function.
- The function uses `proc_getargv()` which can return a sbuf with a length of 0 or -1. This invalid length was not properly handled, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** An attacker-controlled crafted `ps_string` can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which is a memory safety violation.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability arises because `elf_note_prpsinfo` did not properly validate the length of the sbuf returned by `proc_getargv`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the kernel to crash, leading to a system-wide denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted `ps_string`:** A user must be able to influence the creation of the process information string `ps_string`. This can be achieved by constructing a specific argument list for a process.
- **Core Dump Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered during core dump creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to influence the process argument list and trigger the core dump.
- **User-Level Access:** A normal user is capable of triggering the vulnerability by manipulating process arguments.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all supported versions of FreeBSD.
- The vulnerability is fixed in the specified versions of FreeBSD stable/release/security branches with a patch.
- A workaround involves disabling core dumps through sysctl configuration (`kern.coredump=0`).
- NetApp products are affected if they incorporate a vulnerable version of FreeBSD, although the NetApp advisory lists many unaffected products.
