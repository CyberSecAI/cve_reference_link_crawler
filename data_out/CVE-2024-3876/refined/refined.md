Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `page` parameter in the `fromVirtualSer` function. The `sprintf` function is used to format a string with the user-supplied `page` parameter, which is not validated for size.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Stack-based buffer overflow.
    *   Lack of input validation.

*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   The buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially take control of the device.
    *   Denial of service is also possible.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted POST request with an oversized `page` parameter to the `/goform/VirtualSer` endpoint of the vulnerable Tenda F1202 router.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface, typically implying network access. The PoC targets the router on IP 192.168.84.101, suggesting it's likely within the local network.
    *   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Information:**
- The specific vulnerable function is `fromVirtualSer`
- The vulnerable firmware version is F1202 V1.2.0.20(408).
- The `sprintf` function is used to format a string with the user provided `page` parameter, leading to buffer overflow because there are no bounds checks.
- A provided PoC is included.
