The pointer for a necessary buffer will briefly point to a location outside the buffer. During heavy load, or blocks the data is serialized. An attacker can not control the state while this is occurring. The attacker would also have to ensure that the write buffers are primed for this exploit to work. After the extensive setup, there is a small window of time where a possibly useful value could be written. Depending on the value written, this could lead to affects on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the system.   ``` |  |

### Avoid use-after-free in serialization

```

Serializing parsers with large amounts of buffered write data (e.g. in case of
a slow or blocked write destination) would cause "serialize_data" to reallocate
the state buffer whose default size is 64kB (USBREDIRPARSER_SERIALIZE_BUF_SIZE).
The pointer to the position for the write buffer count would then point to
a location outside the buffer where the number of write buffers would be written
as a 32-bit value.

As of QEMU 5.2.0 the serializer is invoked for migrations. Serializations for
migrations may happen regularily such as when using the COLO feature[1].
Serialization happens under QEMU's I/O lock. The guest can't control the state
while the serialization is happening. The value written is the number of
outstanding buffers which would be suceptible to timing and host system system
load. The guest would have to continously groom the write buffers. A useful
value needs to be allocated in the exact position freed during the buffer size
increase, but before the buffer count is written. The author doesn't consider it
realistic to exploit this use-after-free reliably.

### Avoid use-after-free in serialization

```

Serializing parsers with large amounts of buffered write data (e.g. in case of
a slow or blocked write destination) would cause "serialize_data" to reallocate
the state buffer whose default size is 64kB (USBREDIRPARSER_SERIALIZE_BUF_SIZE).
The pointer to the position for the write buffer count would then point to
a location outside the buffer where the number of write buffers would be written
as a 32-bit value.

As of QEMU 5.2.0 the serializer is invoked for migrations. Serializations for
migrations may happen regularily such as when using the COLO feature[1].
Serialization happens under QEMU's I/O lock. The guest can't control the state
while the serialization is happening. The value written is the number of
outstanding buffers which would be suceptible to timing and host system system
load. The guest would have to continously groom the write buffers. A useful
value needs to be allocated in the exact position freed during the buffer size
increase, but before the buffer count is written. The author doesn't consider it
realistic to exploit this use-after-free reliably.
