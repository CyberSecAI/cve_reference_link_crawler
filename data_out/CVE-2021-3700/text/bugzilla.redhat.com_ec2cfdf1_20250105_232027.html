| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1992830#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-11 19:12:44 UTC  ``` An use-after-free vulnerability was found in usbredir in versions prior to 0.11.0 in usbredirparser_serialize() in usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c when serializing large amounts of buffered write data in case of a slow or blocked destination.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/usbredir/-/commit/03c519ff5831ba>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1992830#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-08-11 19:13:15 UTC  ``` Created mingw-usbredir tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1992832](show_bug.cgi?id=1992832 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3700 mingw-usbredir: usbredir: use-after-free in usbredirparser_serialize() in usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c [fedora-all]")]   Created usbredir tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1992831](show_bug.cgi?id=1992831 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2021-3700 usbredir: use-after-free in usbredirparser_serialize() in usbredirparser/usbredirparser.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1992830#c2)  Garrett Tucker    2021-08-11 21:26:22 UTC  ``` This use after free vulnerability is caused by serializing large amounts of write data. The pointer for a necessary buffer will briefly point to a location outside the buffer. During heavy load, or blocks the data is serialized. An attacker can not control the state while this is occurring. The attacker would also have to ensure that the write buffers are primed for this exploit to work. After the extensive setup, there is a small window of time where a possibly useful value could be written. Depending on the value written, this could lead to affects on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the system.   ``` |  |
