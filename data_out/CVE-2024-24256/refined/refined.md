Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `gwbhAIM` parameter in the `saveMove.jsp` file within the `/hr_position/` directory is directly used in a database query without any processing, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Information disclosure: Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `gwbhAIM` parameter in the `saveMove.jsp` file is the entry point for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint using the `gwbhAIM` parameter. The attacker must be able to reach the /hr\_position/saveMove.jsp endpoint

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text includes a suggested description for a vulnerability: "SQL Injection vulnerability in Yonyou space-time enterprise information integration platform v.9.0 and before..." which aligns with the content of the file 3.md
- The file specifies the vulnerable component, which is `saveMove.jsp` in the `/hr_position/` directory, which takes the `gwbhAim` parameter.
- The affected product is Yonyou space-time enterprise information integration platform - <=V9.0
