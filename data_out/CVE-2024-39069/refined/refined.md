Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue. The "ifood Order Manager 'Gestor de Peddios.exe'" application is susceptible to loading a malicious DLL due to an insecure DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure DLL search path:** The application searches for DLLs in locations that a low-privileged user can write to.
*   **DLL hijacking:** The application loads a malicious `d3d12.dll` instead of the legitimate one if present in a higher-priority directory on the search path.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the application (which is an administrator in the provided POC).
*   **Privilege escalation:** Because the application is run by an administrator, the attacker effectively escalates privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local file system:** The attacker needs to place the malicious DLL on the local machine's file system where the application searches for DLLs before finding the legitimate one. In the example provided, the malicious DLL needs to be placed at `C:\Gestor de Peddios\d3d12.dll`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low-level user access:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to the target system (Windows host) and the specific directory used by the application to load DLL files.
*   **Ability to create and transfer malicious DLL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious DLL, in this case using `msfvenom`, and transfer it to the target system.
*   **No need for admin rights before exploitation:** The attack works because the target application is run by an administrator.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

* The provided content offers a specific example of how to exploit this vulnerability with the application `ifood Order Manager 'Gestor de Peddios.exe'`. It provides the exact malicious DLL name (`d3d12.dll`) and the vulnerable directory `C:\Gestor de Peddios`. It includes commands for creating the malicious DLL using msfvenom and details steps on how to achieve the attack. It gives a vendor URL, google drive link to the affected application, and a POC video URL.
