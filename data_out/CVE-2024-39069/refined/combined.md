# ifood Order Manager 'Gestor de Peddios.exe' - DLL hijacking

An attacker places a malicious DLL named "d3d12.dll" in a directory that is searched by the application before the legitimate "d3d12.dll" is found. When the application is launched, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.
