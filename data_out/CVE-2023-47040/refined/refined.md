- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, the attacker needs to have local access. User interaction is required, as indicated by the "UI:R" in the CVSS vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system, and the user needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
