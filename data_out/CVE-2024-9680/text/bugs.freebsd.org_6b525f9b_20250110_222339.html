| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=281992#c0)  Tomasz "CeDeROM" CEDRO    2024-10-10 15:59:27 UTC  ``` An attacker was able to achieve code execution in the content process by exploiting a use-after-free in Animation timelines. We have had reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131.0.2, Firefox ESR < 128.3.1, and Firefox ESR < 115.16.1.  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/> <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9680> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=281992#c1)  Vladimir Druzenko   freebsd_committer freebsd_triage  2024-10-10 20:24:33 UTC  ``` 131.0.2 already in ports. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=281992#c2)  Henrich Hartzer    2024-10-10 22:12:40 UTC  ``` I also see firefox-esr's update backported to quarterly.  Could probably close this one out.  Thank you for the notice, though. Had no idea such a serious vulnerability was out. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=281992#c3)  Tomasz "CeDeROM" CEDRO    2024-10-11 01:18:25 UTC  ``` WOW THAT WAS FAST :-) BIG THANK YOU!! :-) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=281992#c4)  kundewayne    2024-11-25 03:32:16 UTC  ``` MARKED AS SPAM ``` |  |
