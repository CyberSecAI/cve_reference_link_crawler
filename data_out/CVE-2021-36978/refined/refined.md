  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-use-after-free in the `Pl_ASCII85Decoder::write` function. This occurs when a downstream write fails, leading to a use of freed memory.",

      "Heap-use-after-free",
      "Buffer Overflow"

    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to memory corruption, and potentially other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted PDF file that uses ASCII85 encoding within a stream which can cause a downstream write to fail.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable qpdf library."
