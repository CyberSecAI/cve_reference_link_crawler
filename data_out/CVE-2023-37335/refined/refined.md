- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer during the parsing of BMP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the BMP file parsing functionality of Kofax Power PDF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious BMP file or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerable parsing code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious BMP file or a malicious web page that can be accessed by the victim. User interaction is required, meaning the victim must open the file or visit the malicious page.
