The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, which includes information about CVE-2024-36229.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (Stored XSS)
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected and stored in the system.
**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L). The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) and the user must be tricked into performing an action (UI:R) within the scope of the component's vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is scoped to the affected component (S:C).
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low privileges can inject malicious scripts, and a user needs to interact with the injected code (via a browser), for the script to execute.
