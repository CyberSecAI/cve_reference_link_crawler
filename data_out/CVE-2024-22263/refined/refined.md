- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of upload paths in Spring Cloud Data Flow's Skipper server when handling upload package requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Skipper server lacks proper validation and sanitization of file paths during upload operations, leading to an arbitrary file write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user with access to the Skipper server API can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious upload request. This could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted upload requests to the Skipper server API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the Skipper server API to exploit this vulnerability.
