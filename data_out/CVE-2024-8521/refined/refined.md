Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Wavelog web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user in the `manual` parameter of the `/qso` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the `manual` parameter in the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected back to the user's browser, leading to the execution of malicious code within the context of the user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker can create a fake login form and overlay it on the legitimate website to trick the user into entering their credentials.
*   **Credential Theft:** By capturing submitted form data, the attacker can steal the user's credentials.
*   **Session Hijacking:** With arbitrary JavaScript execution, attackers might be able to perform actions as the victim, if the application does not have suitable protections in place.
*   **UI Redressing:** The attacker can overlay the page with their content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker crafts a malicious link containing the XSS payload and sends it to the victim via email or other means.
*   **Social Engineering:** The victim is tricked into clicking the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that injects JavaScript.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to click on the malicious link.
*   **External Position:** The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Wavelog versions prior to 1.8.1.
*   The `manual` parameter in the `/qso` endpoint is vulnerable.
*   The provided example demonstrates how to trigger the XSS with `https://demo.wavelog.org/qso?manual=alert('xss')`
*   A more sophisticated attack is demonstrated to capture credentials by overlaying the page.
