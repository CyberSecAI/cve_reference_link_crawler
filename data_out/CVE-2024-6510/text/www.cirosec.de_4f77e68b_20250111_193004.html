## CVE-2024-6510: Local Privilege Escalation

Local privilege escalation in AVG Internet Security v24 on Windows allows a local unprivileged user to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via COM hijacking.

This was possible by using COM hijacking to execute code in the context of a trusted front-end process. The trust between the front end and the back end was then abused to load a DLL into a process running as SYSTEM, allowing an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM.

For CVE assignment we tried contacting AVG and security@nortonlifelock.com after the fixed release but got no response.

The vulnerability was acknowledged and fixed by AVG within three months.

**CVSS Score**7.8 (CVSS v3)

**CVSS Vector String**CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Affected Version**Versions < 24.1

**Fixed Version**24.1
