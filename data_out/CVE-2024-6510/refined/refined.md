- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  COM hijacking was used to execute code in the context of a trusted front-end process. The trust between the front end and the back end was then abused to load a DLL into a process running as SYSTEM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  COM hijacking, improper trust between front-end and back-end processes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local unprivileged user access.
