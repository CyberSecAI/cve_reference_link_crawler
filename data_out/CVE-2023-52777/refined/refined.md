- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ath11k_mac_get_arvif_by_vdev_id()` function, called within the GTK offload status event handler, was not protected by an RCU read-side critical section, despite the active pdevs being protected by RCU.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A race condition leading to a potential use-after-free vulnerability exists. The code was accessing shared data (active pdevs) without proper synchronization mechanisms within the RCU read-side context.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to a use-after-free scenario, potentially resulting in a system crash or other undefined behavior.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a GTK offload status event. The attacker would likely need to manipulate the system such that a GTK rekey event occurs.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger GTK rekey offload events, typically as a user connected to a Wi-Fi network using the affected driver.
