- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `userid_change` parameter within the `/cgi/usrPasswd.cgi` endpoint of the web servers running on Sunhillo devices. This parameter is reflected into the value of an HTML tag when a user attempts to reset their password using the "Forgot Password" functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `userid_change` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject malicious Javascript code into the HTML context.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code into the user's browser session when the user interacts with the vulnerable application. This can lead to various impacts such as stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious Javascript payload in the `userid_change` parameter. This URL would need to be sent to a user of the vulnerable application who would then need to click it or otherwise trigger it to execute the malicious code within their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the Javascript payload and then social engineer or trick a valid user of the vulnerable webserver to load that crafted URL in their browser.
