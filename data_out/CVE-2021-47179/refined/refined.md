{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The function `pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return()` in `fs/nfs/pnfs.c` was called with a NULL `pnfs_layout_range` argument, which it then dereferenced without checking for NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Kernel crash (oops) leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering the `_pnfs_return_layout()` function with a specific configuration which then calls  `pnfs_mark_matching_lsegs_return()` with a NULL layout range.",
   "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the `_pnfs_return_layout` function via an NFSv4.1/v4.2 client interaction with a server using pNFS (e.g., an ONTAP server). The specific conditions involve returning a layout."
