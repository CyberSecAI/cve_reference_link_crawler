- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a DLL hijacking issue in the CENTUM CAMS Log server. An attacker can replace a legitimate DLL file with a malicious one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284) is present, as the system loads DLLs from untrusted locations. This allows for DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, system manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a computer with the affected product installed or accessing a shared folder. The attacker then replaces a legitimate DLL file with a tampered one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to write to the file system where the vulnerable application loads DLLs, either by having local access to the machine or by having access to a network share. They also need to be able to craft a malicious DLL.
