  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities, especially if targeting high-privilege users like administrators.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload within a specific parameter and tricking a user to access the crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted link. The user must also have admin privileges for the impact to be higher."
