- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Himer theme lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in its poll voting functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Absence of CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can force users to vote on polls, even those they should not have access to. This could lead to manipulated poll results and potentially other unintended consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a vote to the vulnerable endpoint. When a logged-in user visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, casting a vote without the user's direct consent or knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to visit a malicious webpage under their control. No special privileges or prior authentication are needed.
