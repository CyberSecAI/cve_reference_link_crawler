Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-controlled input within the `txtstart_date` and `txtend_date` parameters of the Prison Management System application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling the `txtstart_date` and `txtend_date` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can have various impacts, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the application's interface.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data accessible by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through user-controlled input parameters (`txtstart_date` and `txtend_date`) in the Prison Management System application.
*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL or form that contains the malicious JavaScript payload within these parameters. When the application processes this request, the script would be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the values of the `txtstart_date` and `txtend_date` parameters, either by directly crafting a URL or through other means such as form submissions.
*   No special position on the network is needed, since this is a client side attack, where the victim's browser is executing the attacker's code.
* The attacker has to entice the victim to trigger the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `apply_leave.php` file of the "Prison Management System 1.0"
