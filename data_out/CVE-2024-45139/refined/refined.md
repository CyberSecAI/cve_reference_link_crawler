- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Stager.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges (PR:N), and user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have a user interact with a maliciously crafted file or perform some action within the application to trigger the overflow.
