# The Dataease datasource exists deserialization and arbitrary file read vulnerability

High

[fit2cloudrd](/fit2cloudrd)
published
GHSA-8x8q-p622-jf25
Feb 1, 2024

## Package

maven

io.dataease
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 1.18.14

## Patched versions

1.18.15

## Description

### Impact

A deserialization vulnerability exists in the DataEase datasource, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The location of the vulnerability code is listed below:

`core/core-backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/datasource/type/Mysql.java`

The blacklist of mysql jdbc attacks can be bypassed and attackers can further exploit it for deserialized execution or reading arbitrary files.

The steps are as follows:

```
for (StringillegalParameter: illegalParameters) {
    if (getExtraParams().toLowerCase().contains(illegalParameter.toLowerCase())) {
        DEException.throwException("Illegal parameter: " + illegalParameter);
    }
}
```

For user-controllable jdbc parameters, filtering, filtering blacklist is as follows:

```
privateList < String > illegalParameters = Arrays.asList("autoDeserialize", "queryInterceptors", "statementInterceptors", "detectCustomCollations", "allowloadlocalinfile", "allowUrlInLocalInfile", "allowLoadLocalInfileInPath");
```

But it does not take into account the case of url encoding, you can url encode allowLoadLocalInfile = true:

`%61%6c%6c%6f%77%4c%6f%61%64%4c%6f%63%61%6c%49%6e%66%69%6c%65=%74%72%75%65`

The url encoding successfully bypasses the filter, and the jdbc connection parses the url encoding normally, clicks the verify button, and sends a malicious connection request to the mysql server.

Successfully bypassed the filter:

The server receives a connection with the parameter allowLoadLocalInfile=true and successfully reads the server file.
