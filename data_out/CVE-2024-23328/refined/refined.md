Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-23328.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of user-supplied JDBC parameters when establishing a connection to a MySQL database. Specifically, the application attempts to prevent the use of dangerous parameters like `allowLoadLocalInfile` via a blacklist. However, this blacklist can be bypassed using URL encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input validation. The application filters dangerous parameters based on a blacklist, but it doesn't account for URL encoding, allowing attackers to bypass the filter.
- Use of `allowLoadLocalInfile` parameter in MySQL JDBC connection. This parameter, when set to true, enables reading local files on the server where the MySQL database is hosted.
- Deserialization vulnerability that could allow arbitrary code execution, though the main attack vector described focuses on file read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file read:** By injecting the URL-encoded `allowLoadLocalInfile=true` parameter, an attacker can force the server to read arbitrary files from the MySQL server's file system.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:**  The description notes that the deserialization vulnerability can be further exploited for arbitrary code execution. While the details on how this is achieved are not fully explained, it appears to relate to the bypass of the blacklist leading to further exploitation of the MySQL JDBC driver.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the `extraParams` field in the DataEase datasource configuration to include a URL-encoded malicious parameter like `allowLoadLocalInfile=true`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure or modify datasource settings within DataEase. This suggests the attacker needs some level of access to the DataEase application.

**Additional details:**
- The provided text includes commit diffs showing the fix, which involves adding URL decoding to the parameter check to prevent the bypass.
- The vulnerability was reported by `liangyueliangyue`.
- The fix was introduced in version 1.18.15 of DataEase.
