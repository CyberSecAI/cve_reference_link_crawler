## How Can You Use Open MCT?

Open MCT can be adapted for planning and operations of any system that produces telemetry. While Open MCT is developed to support space missions, its core concepts are not unique to that domain. It can display streaming and historical data, imagery, timelines, procedures, and other data visualizations, all in one place.
