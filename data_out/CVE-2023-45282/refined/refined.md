  "CVE-2023-45282": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure, recursive deep merge function within the Open MCT's Import from JSON functionality. Specifically, the `_deepInstantiate` function in `ImportFromJSONAction.js` recursively processes a JSON file without proper checks for the `__proto__` property.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution: The application is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its custom implementation of deep object merging.",
        "Lack of Input Validation: The `_deepInstantiate` function does not sanitize or validate the input JSON to remove or escape potentially harmful `__proto__` properties."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by crafting a malicious JSON file containing a `__proto__` property with an arbitrary value. This can lead to:",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Import from JSON: The primary attack vector is through the 'Import from JSON' feature in Open MCT.",
         "Malicious JSON file: A specially crafted JSON file with a `__proto__` property injected into it."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": [
           "The attacker needs the ability to import a malicious JSON file to Open MCT through the interface.",
            "No special privileges or access is required to perform the attack."
        ],
        "additional_details": [
          "The vulnerability allows for overriding the prototype of the imported object, which is `MutableDomainObject` in this case.",
          "Successful exploitation leads to a JavaScript exception and application crash, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS).",
          "Depending on the context and the plugin that uses the import functionality, this could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities and lead to more severe outcomes like XSS or CSRF.",
           "The vulnerability can cause a DoS because after the prototype pollution the application will throw an error on trying to access properties of the polluted object. Refreshing the page fixes the issue in most cases, but for some plugins like Plan plugin, the issue remains even after the refresh causing persistent DoS.",
           "The patch involves adding a check in the `_deepInstantiate` function to remove the `__proto__` property from the imported object. Additionally, the use of a third-party library for deep copy/merge/clone of JavaScript objects is recommended."
