The content is related to CVE-2024-38992.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the `registerView` function in the `@airvertco/frappejs` package, which is susceptible to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `registerView` function does not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to pass a specially crafted argument containing the `__proto__` property. This enables modification of the `Object.prototype`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to:
  - Denial of service
  - Remote code execution
  - Cross-site scripting attacks

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `registerView` function. An attacker can call this function with a specially crafted argument containing the `__proto__` property.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `registerView` function with a crafted payload containing the `__proto__` property.
