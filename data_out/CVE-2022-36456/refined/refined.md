  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TOTOLINK A720R router firmware has a command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability in the cstecgi.cgi script. The 'username' parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a command.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `username` parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the router and the ability to send HTTP requests. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required in this context. "
