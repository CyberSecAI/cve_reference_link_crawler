- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to weak entropy for handlers used during the VPN authentication process and a race condition within the same process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Weak entropy in authentication handlers.
    - Race condition in the VPN authentication process.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can hijack an existing AnyConnect VPN session from a target user.
    - An attacker can prevent a target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote attack via crafted HTTPS requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Unauthenticated remote attacker.
    - The attacker must be able to correctly guess an authentication handler.
