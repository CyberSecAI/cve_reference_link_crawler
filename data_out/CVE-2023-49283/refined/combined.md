# Disclosure of sensitive credentials and configuration in containerized deployments

Nov 21, 2023

* Risk: critical
* CVSS v3 Base Score: 10
* CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
* CWE ID: CWE-200
* CWE Name: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

### Description

The “graphapi” app relies on a third-party library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals

the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of

the webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the

ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, and license key.

It’s important to emphasize that simply disabling the graphapi app does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally,

phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to

gather information about the system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this

vulnerability should still be a cause for concern.

Note that Docker-Containers from before February 2023 are not vulnerable to the credential disclosure.

### Affected

* graphapi 0.2.0 – 0.3.0

### Action taken

Delete the file owncloud/apps/graphapi/vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php. Additionally, we disabled the phpinfo function

in our docker-containers. We will apply various hardenings in future core releases to mitigate similar vulnerabilities.

We also advise to change the following secrets:

– ownCloud admin password

– Mail server credentials

– Database credentials

– Object-Store/S3 access-key

# Test code in published microsoft-graph-core package exposes phpinfo()

Moderate

[MIchaelMainer](/MIchaelMainer)
published
GHSA-mhhp-c3cm-2r86
Dec 5, 2023

## Package

composer

microsoft-graph-core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.1

## Patched versions

2.0.2

## Description

### Impact

The Microsoft Graph Core PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that enabled the use of the phpInfo() function from any application that could access and execute the file at vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php. The phpInfo function exposes system information.

The vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of the PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function.

This vulnerability requires a misconfiguration of the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making the PHP application’s /vendor directory web accessible.

The combination of the vulnerability and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes the phpinfo() method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system information like configuration, modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised secrets to access additional data.

### Patches

This problem has been patched in version 2.0.2.

### Workarounds

If an immediate deployment with the updated vendor package is not available, you can perform the following temporary workarounds:

* delete the vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php file
* remove access to the /vendor directory will remove this vulnerability
* disable the phpinfo function

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
