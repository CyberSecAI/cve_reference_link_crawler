The provided content relates to CVE-2023-49283.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a test file (`GetPhpInfo.php`) in the Microsoft Graph Core PHP SDK. This file contains a call to the `phpinfo()` function, which when executed, exposes sensitive system information. The vulnerability is triggered when the `/vendor` directory containing this file is made web-accessible due to server misconfiguration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inclusion of test code (`GetPhpInfo.php`) in the published package
- Unprotected use of the `phpinfo()` function
- Server misconfiguration making the `/vendor` directory web-accessible

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of system information, including configuration, modules, and environment variables.
- Disclosure of sensitive credentials, including ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, database credentials, and object-store/S3 access keys.
- Potential for further attacks by exploiting compromised secrets.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft an HTTP request to execute the `phpinfo()` method if the `/vendor` directory is web-accessible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The server must have a misconfiguration where the `/vendor` directory is accessible via web requests.
