Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from insufficient permission checks when displaying previews of linked artifacts within Tuleap. Specifically, when a user previews an artifact link with a type, the system does not properly enforce project, tracker, and artifact level permissions. This leads to potential information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to properly control access to artifact information when displayed as a linked preview.
-   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The system does not verify whether the user has permission to view the linked artifact, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information (title, status, assigned to, and last update date) of artifacts that they would not normally have access to.
-   **Limited Scope of Disclosure:** The vulnerability is limited to specific fields (title, status, assigned to and last update date) and respects strict field-level permissions. For example, if a title is restricted to a specific user group, this restriction is still enforced.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
-   **Specific User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user tries to preview an artifact link with a type on the artifact view (not reproducible on the artifact modal).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Tuleap platform.
-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. Specifically, a user who is not a member of the private project is able to view the preview of a linked artifact from that private project.
-   **Knowledge of Target Artifacts:** The attacker needs knowledge of the existence and artifact ID of artifacts in a private project, in order to preview them.

**More Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered on the artifact view, not the artifact modal.
*   The fields exposed by the vulnerability include the title, status, assigned to, and last update date of the linked artifact.
*   The vulnerability affects Tuleap Community Edition versions prior to 14.11.99.28, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition versions prior to 14.10-6 and 14.11-3
*   The fix involves checking if the user has view permissions for an artifact before presenting the preview and was addressed in commit `307c1c8044522a2dcc711062b18a3b3f9059a6c3`.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (AC:L)
*   **Privileges Required:** Low (PR:L)
*   **User Interaction:** None (UI:N)
*   **Scope:** Unchanged (S:U)
*   **Confidentiality:** High (C:H)
*   **Integrity:** None (I:N)
*   **Availability:** None (A:N)
