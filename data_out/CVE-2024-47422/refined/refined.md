- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted Search Path
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application loads resources from an uncontrolled path allowing a malicious actor to introduce malicious files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited when the application searches for and loads resources from a path controlled by an attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file in the search path of the vulnerable application. The attack requires user interaction.
