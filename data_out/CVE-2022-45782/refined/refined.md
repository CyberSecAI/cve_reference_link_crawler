- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The password reset token in dotCMS is generated using the `randomAlphanumeric()` method, which is not cryptographically secure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure random number generation leading to predictable password reset tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to an admin account by brute-forcing the password reset token. This is done by requesting a password reset token for the attacker's account, then requesting one for the admin account. The attacker can then leverage the predictability of the token generation method to guess the token for the admin account
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the password reset functionality of dotCMS, specifically by sending a password reset request to `/api/v1/changePassword`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make password reset requests and have the ability to intercept the email containing the password reset token for their own account. They also need the ability to send subsequent password reset requests, to target the admin account.
