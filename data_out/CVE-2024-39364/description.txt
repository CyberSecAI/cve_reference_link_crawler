Advantech ADAM-5630 
has built-in commands that can be executed without authenticating the 
user. These commands allow for restarting the operating system, 
rebooting the hardware, and stopping the execution. The commands can be 
sent to a simple HTTP request and are executed by the device 
automatically, without discrimination of origin or level of privileges 
of the user sending the commands.
