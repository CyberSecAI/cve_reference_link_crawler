- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of external input SQL statements in the `/admin/file/list` interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute illegal SQL commands, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive database data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the `/admin/file/list` interface. The vulnerable parameter is `is_disable`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `is_disable` parameter.
