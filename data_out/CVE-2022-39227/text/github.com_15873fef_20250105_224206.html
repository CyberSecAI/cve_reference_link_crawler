# Token forgery with new claims

Critical

published
GHSA-5p8v-58qm-c7fp
Sep 21, 2022

## Package

pip

python-jwt
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.3.4

## Patched versions

3.3.4

## Description

### Impact

An attacker who obtains a JWT can arbitrarily forge its contents without knowing the secret key. Depending on the application, this may for example enable the attacker to spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 3.3.4

Fixed by: [88ad9e6](https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9)

### Workarounds

None

### References

<https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/python-jwt/PYSEC-2022-259.yaml>

### More information

The vulnerability allows an attacker, who possesses a single valid JWT, to create a new token with forged claims that the verify\_jwt function will accept as valid.

The issue is caused by an inconsistency between the JWT parsers used by python-jwt and its dependency jwcrypto. By mixing compact and JSON representations, an attacker can trick jwcrypto of parsing different claims than those over which a signature is validated by jwcrypto.

Testing the fix has been added as an [automated unit test](https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/blob/master/test/vulnerability_vows.py) to python-jwt.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
