```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an inconsistency between the JWT parsers used by python-jwt and its dependency jwcrypto. By mixing compact and JSON representations, an attacker can trick jwcrypto of parsing different claims than those over which a signature is validated by jwcrypto.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Token forgery: An attacker with a valid JWT can forge its contents without knowing the secret key.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can spoof other user's identities, hijack their sessions, or bypass authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker who obtains a valid JWT can forge its contents by manipulating the representation of the JWT.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to obtain a single valid JWT."
