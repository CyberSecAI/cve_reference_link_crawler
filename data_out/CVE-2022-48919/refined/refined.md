Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2022-48919.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a double-free condition in the CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation within the Linux kernel. This occurs specifically during a failed mount operation when `cifs_get_root()` fails within the `cifs_smb3_do_mount()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a double-free race condition. When the `cifs_get_root()` function fails during mounting, the code calls `deactivate_locked_super()`, which initiates the freeing of the context. The code, in the 'out:' section of `cifs_smb3_do_mount()`, attempts to free the same resources a second time, leading to the double-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a use-after-free condition leading to a kernel panic. The KASAN report shows a use-after-free in `rcu_cblist_dequeue`, and a subsequent crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is triggered when the cifs mount operation fails. This could be triggered via a malformed mount request or by providing parameters to trigger the failure in the `cifs_get_root` call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to initiate a CIFS mount operation, and have control over the parameters to cause a failure in the `cifs_get_root` function. This typically requires local or privileged access.
