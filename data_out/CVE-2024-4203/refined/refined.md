Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4203

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the maps widget of the Premium Addons Pro for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website's database. These scripts are then executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** Specifically, the plugin does not correctly sanitize the `pin_website` attribute within the map widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts.
*   **Compromised User Sessions:** When a user views a page with injected malicious code, the script will execute within their browser session. This could potentially be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the webpage, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user (victim) to access a page containing the injected malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Modify Plugin Settings/Content:**  The attacker needs to have permissions to use the Elementor plugin and add or edit map widgets.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter**: The attacker needs to know the `pin_website` attribute is vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability affects Premium Addons Pro for Elementor plugin versions 4.10.30 and earlier.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 4.10.31.
* The vulnerable code was located in `premium-addons-for-elementor/trunk/widgets/premium-maps.php` file, specifically around line 1374/1375. The fix replaces `esc_attr` and `wp_kses_post` with `esc_url` for output escaping.
