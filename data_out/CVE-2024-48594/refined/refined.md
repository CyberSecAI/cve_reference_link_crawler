Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application lacks proper file type validation during the upload process. It allows users to upload files with any extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The core issue is that the application does not validate file types, allowing users to upload any file, including executable ones.
*   **Lack of Extension Validation:** The application relies on the user-provided filename and doesn't properly check if the extension is acceptable or malicious
*   **Direct File Execution:** After upload, the application allows direct access to the uploaded files through a direct URL, making it possible to execute them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** An attacker can upload and execute malicious code on the server.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can provide an attacker with unauthorized access to the server.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data on the server might be compromised, leading to data leakage or manipulation.
*   **Server Compromise:** A compromised server can be used for further malicious activities, such as lateral movement within the network.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Attackers can potentially use the compromised server to gain access to other systems within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed through a POST request to the file upload endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The exploit utilizes multipart form data to submit the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application (either admin or regular user).
*   **Knowledge of Upload Feature:** The attacker must be aware of the file upload functionality available within the application (at `/Employee/edit-photo.php` or `/Admin/add-admin.php`).
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker has to craft a malicious POST request that contains the payload and a disguised filename (e.g., renaming `1.php` to `1.jpg`, then re-renaming).

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the "Prison Management System Using PHP V1.0" from sourcecodester.com
*   Vulnerable files are `/Employee/edit-photo.php` and `/Admin/add-admin.php`.
*   The content includes a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how to upload a PHP file disguised as an image, and then execute it to reveal the phpinfo()
*   The content provides the specific data packet of a successful attack, including the HTTP request and payload.

This content provides a good description of the vulnerability, its impact and how to exploit it, which is consistent with the description of an arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
