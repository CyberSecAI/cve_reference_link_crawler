Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `phone_number` input in the `book-boat.php` and `/admin/all-booking.php` pages of the PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to reflected XSS attacks due to the unsanitized input field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable input field. When a user accesses the page, this script will execute in their browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions like:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying page content.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through user-supplied input via the `phone_number` parameter in the `book-boat.php` and `/admin/all-booking.php` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `phone_number` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking or accessing the crafted URL for the XSS payload to be executed.

**Technical Details**
The specific XSS payload mentioned is:

```
%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e
```
Which decodes to:
```
<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
```
This payload attempts to inject an image tag and then inject and execute the JavaScript that pops up an alert box with the text XSS

This indicates that the application does not adequately filter out HTML tags and javascript code and that input is reflected back to the user.

**Summary:**

The PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0 is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation on the `phone_number` field in book-boat.php and `/admin/all-booking.php`, allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in a user's browser by crafting a malicious URL.
