# Resolved RCE in Sophos Firewall (CVE-2022-3236)

[← Back to Security Advisories Overview](/en-us/security-advisories)

**Critical**

 **CVE(s)**
CVE-2022-3236

**Updated:**
2023 Dec 11

**Product(s)**
Sophos Firewall

**Publication ID:**
sophos-sa-20220923-sfos-rce

**Article Version:**
3

**First Published:**
2022 Sep 23

**Workaround:**
Yes

## Overview

**[Update December 11, 2023]** A code injection vulnerability allowing remote code execution was discovered in the User Portal and Webadmin of Sophos Firewall. The vulnerability was originally fixed in September 2022. In December 2023, we delivered an updated fix after identifying new exploit attempts against this same vulnerability in older, unsupported versions of the Sophos Firewall.

No action is required if organizations have upgraded their firewalls to a supported firmware version after September 2022.

All the vulnerable devices are running end-of-life (EOL) firmware. We immediately developed a patch for certain EOL firmware versions, which was automatically applied to the 99% of affected organizations that have “accept hotfix” turned on.

Attackers commonly hunt for EOL devices and firmware from any technology vendor, so we strongly recommend that organizations upgrade their EOL devices and firmware to the latest versions.

**[September 23, 2022]** No action is required for Sophos Firewall customers with the "Allow automatic installation of hotfixes" feature enabled on remediated versions (see *Remediation* section below). Enabled is the default setting.

**[Update October 20, 2022]** Sophos has observed this vulnerability being used in the wild. See the *Incident response* section below for details.

### Applies to the following Sophos product(s) and version(s)

Sophos Firewall v19.0 MR1 (19.0.1) and older

## Workaround

Customers can protect themselves from external attackers by ensuring their User Portal, and Webadmin are not exposed to WAN.

Disable WAN access to the User Portal and Webadmin by following [device access best practices](https://docs.sophos.com/nsg/sophos-firewall/19.0/Help/en-us/webhelp/onlinehelp/AdministratorHelp/Administration/DeviceAccess/index.html "https://docs.sophos.com/nsg/sophos-firewall/19.0/Help/en-us/webhelp/onlinehelp/AdministratorHelp/Administration/DeviceAccess/index.html") and instead use VPN and/or Sophos Central (preferred) for remote access and management.

## Remediation
