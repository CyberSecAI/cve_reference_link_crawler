- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow occurs while parsing specially crafted WRL files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious WRL file using the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious WRL file.
