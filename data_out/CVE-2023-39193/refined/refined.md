{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `match_flags()` function in the xtables sctp netfilter module lacks proper input validation for the flag_count field, allowing a read past the end of an allocated data structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges can trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or information disclosure (kernel memory leakage).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Network access if an attacker can somehow manipulate netfilter rules"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges, which typically implies root or administrative access. Also needed is the ability to influence netfilter rules.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in the `xt_sctp` netfilter module. Red Hat has addressed this issue with various security advisories (RHSA-2024:2394, RHSA-2024:2950, RHSA-2024:3138) and a fix was implemented in the 6.6-rc1 kernel version."
