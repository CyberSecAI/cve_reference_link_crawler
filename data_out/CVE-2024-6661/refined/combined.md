### Description

The ParityPress – Parity Pricing with Discount Rules plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'Discount Text' in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered\_html has been disabled.
