### CVE-2021-47136

Based on the provided information, this CVE is related to the fix for a use of uninitialized memory vulnerability in the Linux kernel networking subsystem.

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
- The `skb_ext_add()` function did not initialize the created skb extension memory, relying on the user to do so.
- The `TC_SKB_EXT` extension, which initially contained only a single `chain` value, was later extended with additional fields.
- Not all users of the `TC_SKB_EXT` extension were updated to properly initialize the new fields, leading to use of uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of uninitialized memory. Specifically, the `TC_SKB_EXT` structure was not fully initialized upon allocation via `skb_ext_add`, leading to the possibility that newly added fields contained garbage data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The use of uninitialized memory could lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or crashes.
- The provided UBSAN log indicates a specific case where a boolean field in the `TC_SKB_EXT` structure is loaded with an invalid value, leading to a crash in `net/openvswitch/flow.c`.

**Attack vectors:**
- This is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when specific code paths within the kernel are executed.
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing network packets, specifically within the context of traffic control (tc) and openvswitch.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to influence the network traffic and trigger the vulnerable code paths.
- Specific configurations with tc and openvswitch are likely required for exploitation. This would most likely be a local user with the ability to manipulate network traffic.

The fix for this vulnerability introduces a new function `tc_skb_ext_alloc()` which allocates the `tc_skb_ext` and initializes its memory to 0 using `memset`, resolving the issue of uninitialized memory.
