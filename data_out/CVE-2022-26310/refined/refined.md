**CVE-2022-26310**
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Agent Manager and Improper Authorization in User Management leading to Vertical Privilege Escalation.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the Agent Manager, allowing for the storage of malicious script code, and improper access controls in user management which can lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary script execution within a user's browser and allow unauthorized users to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the Agent Manager, which is then executed in the browsers of users who access the affected section. Additionally, by exploiting user management flaws, a user can escalate their privileges.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to modify agent information to insert malicious code, which would typically require a low-privileged account.
*  **Fixed in Version:** 762 and 761, respectively.
