- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) leading to memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction required (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious file that is then opened by a victim using the vulnerable software.
