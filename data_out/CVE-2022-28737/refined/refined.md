Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `handle_image()` function within the shim component of GRUB2. This function processes EFI executables. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper bounds checking when processing the `SizeOfRawData` field from each section of the EFI executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `handle_image()` function does not properly validate the `SizeOfRawData` field of the sections in a crafted EFI executable. This allows an attacker to specify an overly large value, leading to an out-of-bounds write during the loading process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to write arbitrary data into memory, leading to arbitrary code execution. This could potentially bypass Secure Boot protections and allow the attacker to load malicious code early in the boot process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted EFI Executable:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted EFI executable with a manipulated `SizeOfRawData` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to be able to load the crafted EFI executable.
- **Privileged User:** The attacker requires high privileges to be able to load the crafted EFI image through the shim.
- **User interaction:** The user must be tricked into executing the crafted EFI image, making it a user assisted attack
