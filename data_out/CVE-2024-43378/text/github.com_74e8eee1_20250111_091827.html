# calamares-nixos-extensions LUKS keyfile exposure regression on legacy BIOS systems

High

[ElvishJerricco](/ElvishJerricco)
published
GHSA-vfxf-gpmj-2p25
Aug 15, 2024

## Package

Graphical Calamares Installer
(NixOS)

## Affected versions

≤0.3.16

## Patched versions

0.3.17

## Description

### Impact

Users who installed NixOS through the graphical installer who used manual disk partitioning to create a setup where **all of the following** are true:

* the system was booted via legacy BIOS rather than UEFI; and
* some disk partitions are encrypted; but
* the partitions containing either `/` or `/boot` are unencrypted

have their LUKS disk encryption key file in **plain text** either in `/crypto_keyfile.bin`, or in a CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd.

`nixos-install` **is not affected**, nor are UEFI installations, nor was the default automatic partitioning configuration on legacy BIOS systems.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in calamares-nixos-extensions 0.3.17 via [#43](https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/pull/43), which was included in NixOS via [NixOS/nixpkgs#331607](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/331607) and [NixOS/nixpkgs#334252](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/334252). The current installer images for the NixOS 24.05 and unstable (24.11) channels are unaffected. The fix reached 24.05 at 2024-08-13 20:06:59 UTC, and unstable at 2024-08-15 09:00:20 UTC. Installer images downloaded before those times may be vulnerable.

### Workarounds

The best solution for affected users is probably to back up their data and do a complete reinstallation. However, the mitigation procedure in [GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww](https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww) should work **solely for the case where `/` is encrypted but `/boot` is not**. If `/` is unencrypted, then the `/crypto_keyfile.bin` file will need to be deleted and the `boot.initrd.luks.devices.*.keyFile` options removed in addition to the remediation steps in the previous advisory.

### References

This is a partial regression of [CVE-2023-36476 / GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww](https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww), which was more severe as it applied to the default configuration on BIOS systems.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
