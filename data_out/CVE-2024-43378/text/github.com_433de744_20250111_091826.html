# `calamares-nixos-extensions` LUKS keyfile exposure

Critical

[RaitoBezarius](/RaitoBezarius)
published
GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww
Jun 28, 2023

## Package

Graphical Calamares Installer
(NixOS)

## Affected versions

≤0.3.12

## Patched versions

0.3.13

## Description

### Impact

Users who installed NixOS through the graphical calamares installer, with an unencrypted `/boot`, on either:

* non-UEFI systems
* with a LUKS partition different from `/`

have their LUKS key file in `/boot` as a **plaintext** CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd.

`nixos-install` **is not affected**.

### Am I affected?

Run  `nix-shell -p binwalk --run "binwalk /boot/EFI/nixos/*.efi | grep -i cpio | grep -i crypto_keyfile.bin"` on an EFI system, if you have a match, you are likely to be vulnerable.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in this unreleased commit [vlinkz@837ca4d](https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/commit/837ca4da5521a74d3b5ca6f7b88890a6713faa22).

We plan to release a new extension for 0.3.13 and backport it to NixOS 22.11, 23.05 and unstable channels.

### Workarounds

This is reserved for **expert users** who have a **copy** of their data, we will provide a remediation tool shortly.

To remediate this vulnerability by yourself:

1. Reboot with a NixOS live environment you trust.
2. Mount your rootfs and all relevant LUKS devices using the `crypto_keyfile.bin`, you can achieve by doing `binwalk $initrd -D cpio:.bin` on an initrd containing this "secret", you will obtain a folder containing all the data of CPIO archives, otherwise, you can look for the `append-initrd-secrets` Bash script in your Nix store which shows how to copy this information
3. Confirm you have a backup of your valuable data before moving on.
4. Unmount everything and proceed to a re-encryption procedure:
5. `cryptsetup reencrypt $affected_partition`
6. Remount your partition and confirm that `crypto_keyfile.bin` is not able to unlock your LUKS partition anymore
7. Remount your whole NixOS system
8. Remove any mention of `boot.initrd.secrets."crypto_keyfile.bin"` in your NixOS configuration.
9. Perform a `nixos-rebuild boot` while staying in that live environment via `nixos-enter` or anything you prefer
10. Reboot, you should have a rotated key for all your affected LUKS partitions now

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
