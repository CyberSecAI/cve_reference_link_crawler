- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities, especially when targeting high-privilege users like administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload and tricks a user into opening it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a victim into clicking a malicious URL. For high-privilege impact, they should target admin users.
