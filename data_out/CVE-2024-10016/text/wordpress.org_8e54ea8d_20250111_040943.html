## Description

### WordPress File Upload Types Plugin

Do you want to let your WordPress website accept uploads from your users for more file types and to freely upload files? We created the File Upload Types plugin to make it simple for anyone to easily add support for any file types with any extension or MIME type.

#### How WordPress File Uploads Work

By default, WordPress only allows [certain file types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files#About_Uploading_Files_on_Dashboard) to be uploaded to your website’s media library.

If someone tries to upload a file type outside of these whitelisted WordPress file extensions, this can be the cause of the [common WordPress error](https://www.wpbeginner.com/common-wordpress-errors-and-how-to-fix-them/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fileuploadtyes&utm_content=readme "common WordPress error") `Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons` message.

It can be frustrating if you’ve [created a file upload form](https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-file-upload-form-in-wordpress/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fileuploadtypes&utm_content=readme "
created a file upload form") in WordPress but the file type you want to accept is a file extension that’s not allowed.

This plugin lets your website upload more file types beyond the limited file extension types that WordPress allows by default.

#### How does the File Upload Types plugin work?

The File Upload Types plugin works by letting you adjust the internal file whitelist, letting you manually control which types of file extensions your WordPress website can upload.

This way, you can accept any file type through your website and/or any contact form plugin like [WPForms](https://www.wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fileuploadtypes&utm_content=readme "WPForms").

#### What file types can I upload to WordPress with this plugin?

The File Upload Types plugin lets you allow uploads of any file extension, including custom file types.

Some common file extension types this plugin lets you add that WordPress doesn’t support natively include:

.ai

.zip

.xml

.svg

.csv

.mobi

.cad

.dwg

.dxf

…and any other file extensions that exist, including custom file types.

We hope that you find the File Upload Types plugin helpful!

Having problems uploading permitted file types or with a big file upload? Some [WordPress hosting providers](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fileuploadtypes&utm_content=readme "
WordPress hosting providers") don’t allow you to add all file types, even if you add file types to your media file library with the File Upload types plugin. Hosts can also limit the maximum file upload size you can accept.

### I found a bug, now what?

If you’ve stumbled upon a bug, the best place to report it is in the [File Upload Types GitHub repository](https://github.com/awesomemotive/file-upload-types). GitHub is where the plugin is actively developed, and posting there will get your issue quickly seen by our developers. Once posted, we’ll review your bug report and triage the bug. When creating an issue, the more details you can add to your report, the faster the bug can be solved.

This plug-in just saved me from disaster. I needed to upload an .msi file to my WordPress site just before leaving on a trip, and at the last minute I discovered that WordPress didn’t allow that file type to be uploaded. Even after using FTP to upload the file manually, it still wasn’t showing up when I tried to insert a link to it on a page. After installing this plugin, and dragging and dropping the .msi file into the custom file type area of the plugin’s settings page, WordPress then allowed me to upload the file and insert a link to it in the usual way. Problem solved!

It took me a few minutes to work out that if I uploaded a file into the box at the bottom of the instruction panel that it would automatically verify the mime type and add the upload capabilities to my site without needing to know anything else. It was extremely easy after that and I am so incredibly appreciative for the work this developer has done. THANK YOU.
