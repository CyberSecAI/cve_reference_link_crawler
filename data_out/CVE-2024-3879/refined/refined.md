Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetCfm` function of the Tenda W30Ev1.0 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `formSetCfm` function takes a `funcpara1` parameter from a POST request.
- This parameter is passed to the `save_list_data` function.
- Inside `save_list_data`, the `sprintf` function copies the user-supplied `funcpara1` into a fixed-size 64-byte array (`v10`).
- There is no input validation, allowing a user to provide a string longer than 64 bytes which leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses or other stack-based data.
- The device can be taken over by a malicious actor.
- This can result in denial of service, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/goform/setcfm` endpoint.
- The `funcpara1` parameter contains the oversized payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tenda device (likely LAN access in default configurations).
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests.
- The attacker needs to craft a payload that exceeds the 64-byte buffer in the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware is Tenda W30Ev1.0 V1.0.1.25(633).
- The vulnerable code is inside the `save_list_data` function where `sprintf` is used to copy user-supplied data to a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit script is provided, showing how to trigger the vulnerability with a simple HTTP POST request and a large payload for the `funcpara1` parameter.
