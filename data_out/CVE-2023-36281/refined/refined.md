The provided content is related to CVE-2023-36281.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of Jinja2 templating engine in Langchain's PromptTemplate, which is not sandboxed and allows for arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious template with Jinja2 syntax, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Template Injection:** The primary vulnerability is template injection via Jinja2. The `PromptTemplate` class in Langchain was vulnerable to template injection, especially when loading templates from untrusted sources, such as files.
- **Lack of Sandboxing:** Jinja2 templates in this context were not sandboxed, allowing arbitrary code execution during the rendering process.
- **Loading templates from untrusted sources**: The vulnerability is triggered when loading a template file from untrusted sources, as the attacker can embed malicious code in the template.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system. The provided example uses the `popen` function to execute a `dir` command, but more dangerous commands could be used.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored on the server.
- **System Compromise:** Full system takeover, including installing malware, manipulating data, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File-based Loading:** An attacker provides a malicious template via a file, which is then loaded by the Langchain application using the `load_prompt` function.
- **Untrusted Input:** Loading a prompt template from an untrusted source could trigger the vulnerability if a malicious payload is inserted into the template.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to supply a crafted file with a malicious Jinja2 template to a Langchain application.
- The attacker needs to know the application is loading the file with the vulnerable `load_prompt` function
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server; an indirect attack through file upload/transfer is possible.
