- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'tstats' command in Splunk Enterprise improperly handles JSON, allowing an attacker to bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of JSON within the 'tstats' command. Bypassing of SPL safeguards designed to prevent the execution of risky commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute risky commands with the privileges of a highly privileged user on the affected Splunk instance. This could potentially lead to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to phish a victim, tricking them into initiating a malicious request within their browser while logged into Splunk.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or request that the victim will click while being logged into a vulnerable Splunk instance in their browser. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Splunk instance directly.
