Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on external key (extkey) values during object creation or updates. Specifically, when a user creates or modifies an object, the system does not verify if the referenced objects in the extkey attributes are within the user's allowed scope or "silo".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of silo checks on extkey attributes. This allows users to potentially reference objects that they should not have access to, bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Inconsistent Security Checks:** The vulnerability highlights inconsistencies in how the application handles object references. While access checks may exist in other parts of the system, they were not consistently applied to extkey values during object creation or modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage/Manipulation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could create objects that are linked to other objects that they shouldn't normally have access to. This could lead to data leakage or the manipulation of data across organizational silos/scopes.
- **Cross-Organization Actions:** An attacker may, for example, create a "UserRequest" in an organization outside of their allowed scope, potentially causing disruptions or unauthorized actions within the system.
- **Scope Change:** The vulnerability can cause a scope change, where one component (the vulnerable object) can impact resources beyond its security scope.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Forgery:** Attackers can forge HTTP requests to create or modify objects, including specifying extkey values pointing to objects outside their authorized silo.
- **Console/Portal Exploitation:** The vulnerability exists in both the console and portal interfaces of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low-level privileges to create or modify objects within the application.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires some level of user interaction (e.g., to submit the forged HTTP request).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability includes the implementation of `CheckChangedExtKeysValues()` method within `DBObject` class which verifies that the user can access objects pointed to by extkey attributes before an object is modified.
- The vulnerability is tracked by Combodo ref NÂ°6458 and Huntr report.
