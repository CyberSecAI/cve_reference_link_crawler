Based on the provided content, here's the information about CVE-2024-40576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the "House No" and "Description" fields on the houses page (`index.php`). User-supplied input is not sanitized before being rendered, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious code into the "House No" or "Description" fields.
- When a user views the page displaying these fields, the injected code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the "House No" or "Description" fields. 
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated for the exploit to work, assuming the vulnerable page is accessible to unauthenticated users.
- The attacker can send a malicious URL to the victim or perform the attack through the application directly.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected software is the "Best House Rental Management System" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability exists in the `index.php` file.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting `<script>` tags into the vulnerable fields.
- The exploit is tested on Windows 11, PHP 8.2.4 and Apache 2.4.56
- There is no patched version of the software available.
- The severity is rated as moderate.
