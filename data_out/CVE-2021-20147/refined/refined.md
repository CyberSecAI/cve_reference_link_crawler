Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-20147

**Vulnerability Description:** Windows Domain User Existence Determination

**Root Cause:** The ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (ADSSP) application exposes an API endpoint that allows an unauthenticated user to make requests that respond differently depending on whether a user exists in the configured domain. This is due to an improper implementation within the `/RestAPI/ChangePasswordAPI` endpoint where successful requests to change a user's password (even with invalid passwords) result in a `200 OK` response if the user exists and a `500 Internal Server Error` if the user does not exist.

**Weakness:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability. The system reveals the existence or non-existence of user accounts, which constitutes sensitive information. This also violates security best practices, because successful or unsuccessful user authentication should not reveal user existence.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can enumerate valid usernames in configured Windows domains by analyzing the HTTP status codes received when using the vulnerable endpoint.

**Attack Vector:** Network access to the ADSSP application through the exposed REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ADSSP server on port 8888. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `/RestAPI/ChangePasswordAPI` endpoint.
*   An attacker sends a POST request with parameters like `oldPassword`, `newPassword`, `operation=UMCP`, `umcp=1`, `loginName`, and `domainName`.
*   The ADSSP application responds with HTTP status code `200 OK` if the user specified in `loginName` exists.
*   The application responds with HTTP status code `500 Internal Server Error` if the user does not exist.

**Additional Notes:**
* The specific requests and responses show how the information about a user's existence is leaked via HTTP response codes.
* The advisory specifically notes that oldPassword and newPassword parameters need to conform to the password policies of the target domain, implying that the password policy of the domain is checked before the user existence is evaluated.
* The vulnerability is fixed in build 6116.
