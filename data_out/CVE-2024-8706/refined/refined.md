Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The JFinalCMS system's `/admin/template/edit` interface is vulnerable due to insufficient input validation on the `filename` parameter.
*   The `com.cms.controller.admin.TemplateController#edit` method accepts the filename parameter without proper sanitization.
*   The application then uses this filename parameter in the `com.cms.util.TemplateUtils#read` method, which utilizes the `FileUtils` class from Apache Commons IO to read the file. This allows for arbitrary file reading by crafting the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize the filename parameter, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences like `fakedir/../realdir/filename` to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:**  The lack of input sanitization in the filename parameter allows an attacker to read any file on the server that the application user has permissions to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Exposed information could be leveraged to escalate privileges or perform other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/admin/template/edit` endpoint with a maliciously crafted `filename` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** The attacker likely needs to be authenticated and authorized to access the `/admin/template/edit` endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in JFinalCMS version 1.0 and potentially earlier versions.
* The vulnerability was discovered by user xinjiuW.
* The provided information includes screenshots demonstrating how the path traversal vulnerability is exploited to read `/etc/passwd` file.

This vulnerability is similar to what is described in CVE-2024-277215, which is referenced in the VulDB content, and likely describes the same issue.
