### @gcs278 **[gcs278](/gcs278)** commented [Oct 11, 2023](#issue-1938872991) • edited Loading

This update keys the cache on CD bit, which effectively separates the entries for queries with CD disabled or enabled.

### 1. Why is this pull request needed and what does it do?

The cache plugin currently does not have separate entries for CD disabled/enabled. When a user initially queries WITH the CD bit set, the cache stores the a potentially invalid cache entry. Then if a user queries without CD bit set, CoreDNS will return the invalid cache entry (as if the CD bit was set) which violates [rfc4035#section-4.7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-4.7):

> Resolvers MUST NOT return RRsets from the BAD cache unless the resolver is not required to validate the signatures of the RRsets in question under the rules given in [Section 4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-4.2) of this document.

And [rfc4035.html#section-3.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4035.html#section-3.2.2) specifically says our cache should depend on the CD Bit of the original query:

> If the resolver side implements a BAD cache (see [Section 4.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4035.html#section-4.7)) and the name server side receives a query that matches an entry in the resolver side's BAD cache, the name server side's response depends on the state of the CD bit in the original query.

### 2. Which issues (if any) are related?

[#6186](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/6186)

### 3. Which documentation changes (if any) need to be made?

N/A

### 4. Does this introduce a backward incompatible change or deprecation?

No

Good point. It never uses `out`. I'll clean it up.

Sorry, something went wrong.

At first glance, it does seem cleaner to move `AuthenticatedData`, `RecursionAvailable`, and `Truncated` into `test.Case` and to have an explicit expected `out` value for each test case. However, it seems that `TestCacheInsertion` doesn't actually check these fields in `out`: I can remove everything except `Answer` or `Ns` from `out` in each of the test cases, and tests still pass. That seems strange to me.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Great catch. I think the right thing to do is to add the various header flag checks to the `Header` function:

[coredns/plugin/test/helpers.go](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/4652bf17a95844f18008ce782201eb33f95ba6dd/plugin/test/helpers.go#L127)

[4652bf1](/coredns/coredns/commit/4652bf17a95844f18008ce782201eb33f95ba6dd)

|  | func Header(tc Case, resp \*dns.Msg) error { |
| --- | --- |

However, i started down this path and saved my progress here: [master...gcs278:coredns:unit-test-header-checking](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/compare/master...gcs278%3Acoredns%3Aunit-test-header-checking), but this seems like a large unit test change and a bit out of the scope of this PR.

So, for the time being, I added the individual checks in `TestCacheInsertion` (AuthenticatedData, RecursionAvailable, CheckingDisabled, Authoritative). Note that Truncated actually doesn't really need to be checked, because the expectation is that Truncated responses should never be cached.

I can follow up with another PR with the unit test changes. It seems like a gap in coverage that we aren't consistently checking the header flags for the plugins.

I also realize this PR leaves things in a bit of a transitional phase in which these fields are move into `test.Case`, but other unit tests are still utilizing adding the header bits at the top level test case structure such as in `cname_test.go`:

[coredns/plugin/template/cname\_test.go](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/blob/2fe5890d8b7fc7801d308dbb51bf29c57ee9a92b/plugin/template/cname_test.go#L66)

Line 66
in
[2fe5890](/coredns/coredns/commit/2fe5890d8b7fc7801d308dbb51bf29c57ee9a92b)

|  | Truncated bool |
| --- | --- |

I don't think this is too problematic to be in this transitional state, since I feel like it like the header flags should be transitioned to be specified in the `test.Case`, but feel free to let me know if you feel differently.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Nope that doesn't make sense, I think I was just iterating through the header fields, but TC bit only matters for responses. We won't cache truncated entries, and that test is covered in `TestCacheInsertion`, so I'll delete this.

The error messages above include the index of the test case, so it would make sense for these error messages to include it as well:

Suggested change

|  | t.Error("Expected Authoritative Answer bit to be true, but was false") |
| --- | --- |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.AuthenticatedData != tc.out.AuthenticatedData { |
|  | t.Errorf("Expected Authenticated Data bit to be %t, but got %t", tc.out.AuthenticatedData, resp.AuthenticatedData) |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.RecursionAvailable != tc.out.RecursionAvailable { |
|  | t.Errorf("Expected Recursion Available bit to be %t, but got %t", tc.out.RecursionAvailable, resp.RecursionAvailable) |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.CheckingDisabled != tc.out.CheckingDisabled { |
|  | t.Errorf("Expected Checking Disabled bit to be %t, but got %t", tc.out.CheckingDisabled, resp.CheckingDisabled) |
|  | t.Errorf("Test %d: Expected Authoritative Answer bit to be true, but was false", n) |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.AuthenticatedData != tc.out.AuthenticatedData { |
|  | t.Errorf("Test %d: Expected Authenticated Data bit to be %t, but got %t", n, tc.out.AuthenticatedData, resp.AuthenticatedData) |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.RecursionAvailable != tc.out.RecursionAvailable { |
|  | t.Errorf("Test %d: Expected Recursion Available bit to be %t, but got %t", n, tc.out.RecursionAvailable, resp.RecursionAvailable) |
|  | } |
|  | if resp.CheckingDisabled != tc.out.CheckingDisabled { |
|  | t.Errorf("Test %d: Expected Checking Disabled bit to be %t, but got %t", n, tc.out.CheckingDisabled, resp.CheckingDisabled) |

On the other hand, I notice that some `t.Error`s below don't print the index. Rather than changing all the error messages, might be simpler to rewrite this test to use `t.Run`. Alternatively, if you want to keep things simple in this PR, just `t.Log("Test", n)` at the top of the loop.

On the gripping hand, it's just an error message in a test that shouldn't be failing anyway, so ¯\\_ (ツ)\_/¯.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Good point. I bit bullet and added another commit that wraps `TestCacheInsertion` in `t.Run`. I moved the test case struct into the unit test function, so you can reap the benefit of running individual test cases (at least with GoLand and I presume `go test` as well).

The file name has a typo: `prefech_test.go` should be `prefetch_test.go`. Potential follow-up clean-up.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Oh wow, didn't even notice. Added as a separate commit, but let me know if it's too much for this PR.

Why do you need `break` here? Wouldn't an empty `case` clause have the same effect? I know I reviewed this code before and didn't comment on this line then, but I can't see a reason for it now, so if there is a valid reason, it's subtle enough that it warrants a comment.

Capitalization is inconsistent here and a few other places: "bit" versus "Bit". (I hesitate to comment on such a trivial thing...)

These should be `t.Fatalf` now. You still want to go to the next test case (which pre-`t.Run`-refactoring was done by `continue`) rather than do all the `if resp.foo != tc.out.foo { t.Errorf(...) }` checks below if you didn't find a cache entry or got an unexpected cache entry. (Alternatively, you could make the `if found` into an `else if found`.)

Done - I debated internally about this and thought it wouldn't hurt to continue checking the improperly found cache item, but now that seems pointless since the test is already invalid.
