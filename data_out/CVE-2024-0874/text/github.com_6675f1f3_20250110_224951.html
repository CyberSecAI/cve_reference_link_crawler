| I think some DNS resolvers choose to not cache queries with CD bit set at all, but `unbound-1.17.1-2.fc38.x86_64` has properly working separate caches for example. |

| I have opened [#6354](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/pull/6354) which introduces cache separation for queries with the CD bit set. The [RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4035.html#section-3.2.2) speaks to the approach for managing a BAD cache, suggesting to me that separating the cache is a reasonable way to approach this.  Please feel free to review and comment. |
