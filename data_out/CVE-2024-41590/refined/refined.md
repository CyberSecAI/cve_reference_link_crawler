Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-41590:

**Root Cause:**
- Several CGI pages in the Web UI have buffer overflow vulnerabilities because user data is not validated before being passed into the `strcpy()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the unsafe use of `strcpy()`. This function does not perform bounds checking, leading to memory corruption when copying user-supplied input into a fixed-size buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service condition, potentially crashing the device or causing it to become unresponsive.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability is also likely exploitable for remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web UI:** The attack vector is through the web user interface (Web UI) of the DrayTek router.
- **CGI Pages:** Specific vulnerable CGI pages are targeted, where user-supplied data is copied into a buffer using `strcpy()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires valid administrator credentials to access the vulnerable CGI pages and trigger the buffer overflow.
