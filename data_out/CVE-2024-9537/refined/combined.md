# Rackspace Breach Linked to Zero-Day Vulnerability in ScienceLogic SL1’s Third-Party Utility

### [< BACK TO BLOG](/resources/blog/)

On September 24, 2024, Rackspace, a managed cloud computing company providing cloud hosting, dedicated servers, and multi-cloud solutions, reported an issue with their Rackspace Monitoring product in the ScienceLogic EM7 (ScienceLogic SL1) Portal. Rackspace utilizes the ScienceLogic application as a third-party tool for monitoring certain internal services.

Days later, subsequent communications to customers revealed that a threat actor had exploited an undocumented zero-day vulnerability in a non-Rackspace utility bundled with the ScienceLogic application. The threat actor has not yet been linked to any known groups at this time. Rackspace promptly informed ScienceLogic about the vulnerability and collaborated with them to develop a patch for remediation. ScienceLogic has since made the patch available to all its customers.

Rackspace has indicated that the breach was limited to performance monitoring data of low-security sensitivity. This data included customer account names and numbers, customer usernames, Rackspace internally generated device IDs, names and device information, device IP addresses, and AES256 encrypted Rackspace internal device agent credentials. The company also confirmed that all affected customers have been notified, and no action is required on their part.

### **Vulnerability**

During Rackspace and ScienceLogic’s collaboration to develop a remediation, it was discovered that the undocumented zero-day vulnerability was a remote code execution flaw in a third-party utility not developed by ScienceLogic, but included with the SL1 package. ScienceLogic has also chosen not to disclose the name of the third-party utility to avoid giving potential threat actors any insights, noting that the utility may be used in other products as well. Currently, this vulnerability does not have a CVE assigned. Additionally, Arctic Wolf has not identified any other impacted products or a publicly accessible proof of concept exploit.

### **Risk of Exploitation**

Arctic Wolf will continue monitoring intelligence sources for any additional vendors or products affected by this vulnerability and its details once a CVE is assigned. A remote code execution vulnerability affecting a third-party utility used by various other products presents an appealing target for threat actors, as it offers a broad attack surface for exploitation, similar to the infamous Log4j, a third-party library, which was exploited in 2021 to allow attackers to execute arbitrary code across millions of systems.

## **Recommendations**

### **Recommendation #1: Update ScienceLogic SL1**

ScienceLogic has stated that the issue has been resolved and updates have been provided to all affected customers. If you use ScienceLogic SL1 in your environment, Arctic Wolf strongly recommends updating ScienceLogic SL1 to mitigate this zero-day vulnerability. The System Updates page allows you to update the software on your SL1 appliances (System > Tools > Updates). More information on updating SL1 can be found here: <https://docs.sciencelogic.com/latest/Content/Web_Admin_and_Accounts/System_Administration/sys_admin_system_upgrade.htm>

### **Recommendation #2: Follow Updates**

Given the potential for the vulnerability to affect other products and applications, Arctic Wolf recommends monitoring for updates in case any of your utilized products are disclosed as impacted in the future. We will continue to monitor for updates surrounding impacted products as well.

# Rackspace monitoring data stolen in ScienceLogic zero-day attack

Cloud hosting provider Rackspace suffered a data breach exposing "limited" customer monitoring data after threat actors exploited a zero-day vulnerability in a third-party tool used by the ScienceLogic SL1 platform.

ScienceLogic confirmed to BleepingComputer that they quickly developed a patch to address the risk and distributed it to all impacted customers while still providing assistance where needed.

"We identified a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability within a non-ScienceLogic third-party utility that is delivered with the SL1 package," explained a statement from Jessica Lindberg, Vice President at ScienceLogic.

"Upon identification, we rapidly developed a patch to remediate the incident and have made it available to all customers globally."

ScienceLogic declined to name the third-party utility to avoid providing hints to other hackers, as it might be used on several other products.

The attack was first disclosed by a [user on X](https://x.com/ynezzor/status/1839931641172467907) who warned that a Rackspace outage from September 24 was due to active exploitation in the hosting provider's ScienceLogic EM7.

"Oopsie, a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability was exploited ... third-party ScienceLogic application used by Rackspace," an account named ynezz [shared on X](https://x.com/ynezzor/status/1839931641172467907).

"We have confirmed that the exploit of this third-party application resulted in access to three internal Rackspace monitoring webservers."

[![Ynezz tweet](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/vulnerabilities/s/sciencelogic/rackspace/ynezz-tweet.jpg)](https://twitter.com/ynezzor/status/1839931641172467907)

ScienceLogic SL1 ([formerly EM7](https://sciencelogic.com/blog/a-new-defining-moment-for-sciencelogic)) is an IT operations platform for monitoring, analyzing, and automating an organization's infrastructure, including cloud, networks, and applications.

It provides real-time visibility, event correlation, and automated workflows to help manage and optimize IT environments efficiently.

Rackspace, a managed cloud computing (hosting, storage, IT support) company, uses ScienceLogic SL1 to monitor its IT infrastructure and services.

In response to the discovery of the malicious activity, Rackspace disabled monitoring graphs on its MyRack portal until they could push an update to remediate the risk.

However, the situation was worse than what a short [Rackspace service status update](https://rackspace.service-now.com/system_status?id=detailed_status&service=4dafca5a87f41610568b206f8bbb35a6) reflected.

As [first reported by The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/30/rackspace_zero_day_attack/), Rackspace's SL1 solution was hacked via the zero-day and some customer information was stolen.

In an email sent to customers and seen by The Register, Rackspace warned that the hackers exploited the zero-day to gain access to web servers and steal limited customer monitoring data, including customer account names and numbers, customer usernames, Rackspace internally generated device IDs, device name and information, IP addresses, and AES256 encrypted Rackspace internal device agent credentials.

Rackspace rotated those credentials as a precaution, despite them being strongly encrypted, and informed customers they needed to take no further action to protect from the malicious activity, which had been stopped.

While the data is limited, it is common for companies to hide their devices' IP addresses behind content delivery systems and DDoS mitigation platforms. Threat actors could use the exposed IP addresses to target company's devices in DDoS attacks or further exploitation attempts.

It is unknown how many customers have been impacted by this breach.

*Update 10/2* - A RackSpace spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following information:

> On September 24th, 2024, Rackspace discovered a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in a non-Rackspace utility that is packaged and delivered by the third-party ScienceLogic application (known as SL1).  This was not a Rackspace vulnerability. Rackspace utilizes the ScienceLogic application internally to provide system monitoring of some (but not all) Rackspace services.
>
> The system improperly accessed, as a result of exploitation of the SL1 vulnerability, is a Rackspace system used for generating internal performance reporting and is internal to Rackspace. Our forensic investigation identified no access to customer configurations, or their hosted data.
>
> Rackspace immediately notified ScienceLogic of their vulnerability. Rackspace worked with ScienceLogic to ensure development of a patch to remediate their vulnerability, and ScienceLogic has now made it available to all of their customers globally.
>
> Limited performance monitoring information of low-security sensitivity was improperly accessed. Out of an abundance of caution, all impacted customers have been notified. No remediation steps are required from customers.
>
> Rackspace’s monitoring functionality is not dependent on the ScienceLogic dashboard, and our Rackspace customer performance monitoring was not impacted by this event.  There was no interruption to our monitoring and alerting services for our customers.
>
> The only service impact to customers was the inability to access their associated ScienceLogic monitoring dashboard, which is an optional service feature infrequently utilized by some customers. - Rackspace spokesperson

Exclusive Rackspace has told customers intruders exploited a zero-day bug in a third-party application it was using, and abused that vulnerability to break into its internal performance monitoring environment.

That intrusion forced the cloud-hosting outfit to temporarily take its monitoring dashboard offline for customers.

Reading between the lines, it appears Rackspace was hosting a ScienceLogic-powered monitoring dashboard for its customers on its own internal web servers, those servers included a program that was bundled with ScienceLogic's software, and that program was exploited, using a zero-day vulnerability, by miscreants to gain access to those web servers. From there, the intruders were able to get hold of some monitoring-related customer information before being caught.

"On September 24, 2024, Rackspace discovered a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in a non-Rackspace utility, that is packaged and delivered alongside the third-party ScienceLogic application," a spokesperson for Rackspace told *The Register* Monday.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_specialfeatures/cybersecuritymonth&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4EeAFPLBgOPLAjC-o7h6AAAAEA&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_specialfeatures/cybersecuritymonth&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4EeAFPLBgOPLAjC-o7h6AAAAEA&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

Yes, it not only discovered that flaw in the third-party utility, it realized it had been exploited.

Rackspace uses a ScienceLogic stack internally for system monitoring and providing a dashboard to users. ScienceLogic, which supplies IT infrastructure observation software, did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the exploitation.

Abusing this zero-day vulnerability gave the criminals access to three of Rackspace's internal monitoring web servers, "and some limited monitoring information," a Rackspace spokesperson told us, adding:

Customer performance monitoring was not impacted by this event. The only impact to customers was the inability to access their associated monitoring dashboard. There was no other customer service disruption as a result of this event.

A letter sent to Rackspace customers and shared earlier with *The Register* by a reader provides additional details about what the crooks accessed. It notes that "limited" internal monitoring information included: Customer account names and numbers, customer usernames, Rackspace internally generated device IDs, names and device information, device IP addresses, and AES256 encrypted Rackspace internal device agent credentials.

We've asked Rackspace for more details, such as how many customers were affected, regarding this cyber close shave.

* [How much to clean up a ransomware infection? For Rackspace, about $11M](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/16/rackspace_ransomware_expenses/)
* [Rackspace customers rage as email outage continues and migrations create migraines](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/05/rackspace_hosted_exchange_security_update/)

* [T-Mobile US to cough up $31.5M after that long string of security SNAFUs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/30/tmobile_data_breaches_settlement/)

The letter customers received also says there is no need for them to take any remediation steps, but "in an abundance of caution, we commenced rotation of the Rackspace internal device agent credentials."

"There was no other customer service disruption as a result of this event," the biz told its clients. "No other Rackspace products, platforms, solutions, or businesses were affected by this event. We have actively notified all affected customers and are updating customers as appropriate."

> No other Rackspace products, platforms, solutions, or businesses were affected by this event

Rackspace also assured us that upon spotting the security breach, it immediately isolated the affected equipment, took them offline, and then worked with ScienceLogic to develop and apply a patch.

"ScienceLogic has notified their customers, and we have actively notified Rackspace customers utilizing this third-party monitoring service," the spokesperson said.

In December 2022, the IT provider's hosted Microsoft Exchange service was hit by a [ransomware infection](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/03/rackspace_security_incident_hosted_exchange/), which shut down email services to [thousands of customers](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/05/rackspace_hosted_exchange_security_update/), most of whom were small and mid-sized businesses.

The company's expenses related to that cyberattack, also a result of a zero-day exploit, hit about [$11 million](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/16/rackspace_ransomware_expenses/), Rackspace said in a 2023 regulatory filing. ®

### Updated to add at 0100 UTC, September 30

While we continue to press ScienceLogic to identify the third-party application that was exploited, the biz has told us the vulnerable program was bundled with its SL1 monitoring product, and that it is pushing out a fix to its clients.

"We identified a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability within a non-ScienceLogic third-party utility that is delivered with the SL1 package, for which no CVE has been issued," a spokesperson for ScienceLogic told us.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_specialfeatures/cybersecuritymonth&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=3&c=33Z4EeAFPLBgOPLAjC-o7h6AAAAEA&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_specialfeatures/cybersecuritymonth&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=3&c=33Z4EeAFPLBgOPLAjC-o7h6AAAAEA&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

"Upon identification, we rapidly developed a patch to remediate the incident and have made it available to all customers globally. We are focused on assisting our customers in implementing the fix to minimize their risk. We will continue to update customers as appropriate."

### Updated to add at 0400 UTC, September 30

ScienceLogic has declined to identify the exploited bundled software. A spokesperson told us: "At this point, we are not naming the third-party utility to diminish potential risk to our customers. We are aware of only one instance when the vulnerability has been exploited and a patch was quickly provided."

That one instance being, so far, Rackspace.

Speaking of which, the cloud virtual server host has been in touch to stress that it was its self-hosted ScienceLogic dashboard that was hit via the zero-day and that while that web interface was taken offline, its monitoring services continued to run.

"Rackspace’s monitoring functionality is not dependent on the ScienceLogic dashboard," a spokesperson informed us.

"Our Rackspace monitoring functionality was not impacted and there was no interruption to our monitoring and alerting services for our customers."
