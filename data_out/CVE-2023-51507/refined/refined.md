- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited. However, it could allow an unauthenticated user to perform actions they are not intended to. The specific impact will vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a function lacking proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
