{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Atahualpa theme for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access to sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into submitting it, often through social engineering or malicious links.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a request to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed by the attacker."
