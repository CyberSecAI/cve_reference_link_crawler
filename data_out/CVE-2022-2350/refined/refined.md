Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-2350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks within the "Disable User Login" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify user permissions and does not include CSRF tokens when updating settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to modify its settings, which should be restricted to administrators or authorized users.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:**  The absence of CSRF protection makes it possible for attackers to craft malicious requests that can modify plugin settings without the victim's consent, provided the victim is logged into the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can block or unblock users at will. This could result in:
    *   Denial of service by blocking legitimate user accounts.
    *   Disruption of the website's functionality.
    *   Potential for unauthorized access by selectively unblocking accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to initiate the attack
*   **CSRF:** Exploits the lack of CSRF protection via crafted requests that can be triggered when a logged-in admin visits a malicious page or a page with a malicious injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to know the URL of the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint
*   For successful exploitation, the attacker would need to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious site/page in order to take advantage of the CSRF vector.
