- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Site Protector plugin <= 2.0 lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through CSRF attacks, where a malicious site or email can trick a logged-in user into executing unwanted actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress site to visit a malicious site or click a link controlled by the attacker. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the vulnerable WordPress site.
