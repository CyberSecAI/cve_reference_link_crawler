A guest user could exploit a chart data REST API and send arbitrary SQL statements that on error could leak information from the underlying analytics database.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.0.4, from 3.1.0 before 3.1.1.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.1.1 or 3.0.4, which fixes the issue.
