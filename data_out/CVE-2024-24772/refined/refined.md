Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of custom SQL statements within the embedded context of Apache Superset's chart data REST API. Specifically, a guest user can inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied SQL queries, allowing for injection of malicious SQL statements.
- **Information Disclosure:** Error messages generated from the execution of these injected queries reveal details about the underlying analytics database, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain insights into the structure, schema, and contents of the underlying analytics database by exploiting SQL error messages.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Depending on the database setup and permissions, it may be possible to further escalate an attack by crafting SQL queries that perform data manipulation or exfiltration, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Chart data REST API:** The vulnerability is triggered by making requests to the chart data REST API.
- **Custom SQL statements:** The attack relies on injecting custom or arbitrary SQL statements through this API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest User:** The attacker only needs to be a guest user, indicating no authentication is required beyond the typical guest level access, which is significant.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker must know or discover the chart data REST API to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to craft SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL statements.
