Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an unrestricted SQL injection vulnerability in the `view_csprofile.php` file of the Online Graduate Tracer System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `view_csprofile.php` file is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain sensitive server information by injecting malicious SQL code. This could include database schema, user credentials, and other confidential data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `view_csprofile.php` file. The `id` parameter in the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication requirements are mentioned in the provided text, implying that the vulnerability could be exploited without prior authentication. However, the `Referer` header in the provided PoC shows that an admin session might be required, although this is not explicitly confirmed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a `UNION` based injection to extract the database name, using `updatexml` to trigger an error with the database name included in the error message.
