Stable Editon and Developer Edition are different in nature and purpose, and have different release intervals regarding new features and code changes. Most advanced users of SoftEther VPN prefer the Developer Edition. Most users who use SoftEther VPN for stable work or enterprise prefer the Stable Edition.

Updates to SoftEther VPN Stable Edition are released as infrequently as 2 to 4 times a year, except when "critical" or "urgent" vulnerabilities are discovered.

Examples of recent "critical" or "urgent" vulnerabilities:

2023/06/30: SE202301: Security Advisory: [CVE-2023-27395](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-33mh-qwc8-jxxx "CVE-2023-27395") etc: Fixed 6

vulnerabilities of SoftEther VPN in cooperation with Cisco Systems, Inc

<https://www.softether.org/9-about/News/904-SEVPN202301>

2023/08/31: TunnelCrack protection implemented in SoftEther VPN Client

<https://www.softether.org/9-about/News/905-TunnelCrack>

2019/07/09: SE201901: SoftEther VPN Server NDIS 5.x Windows Local Bridge

Driver Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

<https://www.softether.org/9-about/News/900-SEVPN201901>

Update history:

<https://www.softether.org/5-download/history>

The reason is that many users of SoftEther VPN Stable Edition place the utmost importance on stability in order to use it for business purposes. To meet their demands, it is necessary to ensure that stability is never compromised by changes in code or behavior. For this reason, the various code and behaviors added or changed in the Developer Edition must be well tested by Developer Edition users for a minimum of three months.

An exception to the above, of course, is if a "critical" or "urgent" vulnerability arises, in which case a fix will be made available immediately for the Stable Edition. A "critical" or "urgent" vulnerability is one where the risk to confidentiality, integrity, or availability outweighs the benefit of maintaining stability.

CVE-2024-38520 is not an urgent vulnerability. It has no impact on confidentiality/integrity. As for availability, the UDP amp multiplier is approximately 2x, and there is no imminent risk of an immediate individual specific exploit.

Therefore, the code and behavior changed in Developer Edition 5.02.5185 will need to be tested for a period of time to ensure that there are no issues with user L2TP communications. We will apply the same patch to SoftEther VPN Stable Edition after we are sure that this change in the behavior of the L2TP communication code will not cause any detrimental side effects for the many Stable Edition users who are using L2TP for their daily important work.

Sorry, something went wrong.
