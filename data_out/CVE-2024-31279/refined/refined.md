- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Generate Child Theme plugin for WordPress versions <= 2.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious requests that target a vulnerable endpoint within the plugin, an attacker can exploit the lack of CSRF protection to trick an authenticated user into performing unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into interacting with the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site, just the victim.
