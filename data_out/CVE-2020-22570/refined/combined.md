### **[NB-zhibin](/NB-zhibin)** commented [Mar 27, 2020](#issue-589010832)

| memcached maintainer,  I found a NULL pointer reference bug in code of memcached, which could conduct DoS by remote artificial command.  The affected memcached version: >1.6.0.  The bug location is at file: memcached.c, detailed information as the following:  In the function "process\_mget\_command", the local variable "errstr" is defined as a char\*, which is not initialized. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62643867/77742729-e2ebfd80-7051-11ea-8421-8ca62bf4cab8.png)  In certain condition, the function "\_meta\_flag\_preparse" is called in "process\_mget\_command", and the address of "errstr" is the 4th param. In the function "\_meta\_flag\_preparse", there is chances that the "\*errstr" is not initialized while command is "F" or "S". [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62643867/77742808-08790700-7052-11ea-895a-61a77b72af93.png)  then, out\_errstring->out\_string->strlen referencing a NULL pointer, conduct a crash.

| Hi [@NB-zhibin](https://github.com/NB-zhibin)  You reached out over discord and I didn't hear back; you didn't submit this privately. May I ask what your motivation is? Is this for a class at school? |

| [@NB-zhibin](https://github.com/NB-zhibin)  我之前在discord上有跟您聯系，並沒有得到你的回複，而你也沒有私底下提交這個bug。想問你提交這個request是否與學校作業有關。（如果比較方便的話，您可以用中文回複。） |
