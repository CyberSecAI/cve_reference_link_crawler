The content is related to CVE-2020-22570.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `process_mget_command` function of memcached. The local variable `errstr` is not initialized. In certain conditions, specifically when the `_meta_flag_preparse` function is called, the `*errstr` is not initialized when the command is "F" or "S". This leads to an attempt to dereference a NULL pointer through `out_errstring->out_string->strlen`, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Uninitialized variable: The `errstr` variable is not initialized before being potentially used in `_meta_flag_preparse`.
  - NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer via `out_errstring->out_string->strlen` when `*errstr` is not initialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Denial of Service (DoS): The NULL pointer dereference causes a crash, which can be triggered remotely, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
  - Remote artificial command: The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted remote command that reaches the vulnerable code path in `process_mget_command`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the memcached server, likely over a network connection.
  - The attacker needs to craft a command that triggers the specific code path leading to the uninitialized `errstr` variable and the subsequent NULL pointer dereference.
