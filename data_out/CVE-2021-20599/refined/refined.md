Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-20599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the cleartext transmission of sensitive information during the authentication process in the Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-R series CPU modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-319:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. The affected devices transmit authentication credentials, other than the password, in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can potentially bypass authentication and log in to the CPU module by obtaining credentials other than the user's password, which are transmitted in clear text.
- Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and control of the affected industrial control systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** Exploiting the vulnerability is considered to have low attack complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected devices.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of MELSEC iQ-R series Safety CPU and SIL2 Process CPU modules.
- The vulnerability is associated with the use of a clear text communication protocol where sensitive data is not encrypted during transmission.
- A CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 is assigned, indicating a critical severity due to the high impact on confidentiality and integrity with no impact on availability.
-  A CVSS v4 base score of 7.8 has been calculated.
