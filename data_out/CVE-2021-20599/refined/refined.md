Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Cleartext transmission of sensitive information. The affected Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC iQ-R Series CPU modules transmit credentials, other than password, in cleartext, which can be intercepted by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-319:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. This vulnerability arises from the lack of encryption or secure transport mechanisms for sensitive data, allowing unauthorized interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the CPU module by intercepting and using the transmitted credentials. This access could enable them to manipulate the device, potentially impacting industrial control processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, over a network.
*   **Low attack complexity:** Exploitation is considered to have a low level of complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic to capture the cleartext credentials. This implies network access to the targeted device. No specific privileges or user interaction is needed on target host

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-20599.
*   The affected products include various MELSEC iQ-R series Safety and SIL2 Process CPU modules with specific firmware versions.
*   The advisory provides mitigation strategies including using firewalls, VPNs, LAN access restrictions, and IP filters.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ivan Speziale of Nozomi Networks.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 and a v4 score of 7.8 have been calculated.
