Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36896:

**CVE-2022-36896**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of permission checks in several HTTP endpoints within the BMC AMI DevX Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and Code Pipeline Plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission checks on HTTP endpoints.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can enumerate hosts and ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs stored in Jenkins. This information can be leveraged in further attacks to potentially capture the actual credentials using other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance, specifically targeting the vulnerable plugin's HTTP endpoints.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins environment to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of Vulnerability**

The vulnerability in the BMC AMI DevX Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and Code Pipeline Plugin (versions 2.0.12 and earlier) allows an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to enumerate hosts/ports of Compuware configurations, as well as credential IDs, by making requests to specific HTTP endpoints that lack proper permission validation. This information could then potentially be used to capture the credentials via another vulnerability.

**Affected Component:**
* BMC AMI DevX Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and Code Pipeline Plugin
* Specifically versions 2.0.12 and earlier.

**Fix:**
* Update the BMC AMI DevX Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and Code Pipeline Plugin to version 2.0.13

This update includes the necessary permission checks.
