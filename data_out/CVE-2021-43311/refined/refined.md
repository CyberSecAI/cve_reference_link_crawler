The content is related to CVE-2021-43311.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by multiple heap-based buffer overflows within the `get_le32()` function in UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables). Specifically, a generic pointer 'p' points to an inaccessible memory address when dereferenced, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflows in `get_le32()` function
- Dereferencing a generic pointer 'p' pointing to an inaccessible address.
- Vulnerable code locations within `p_lx_elf.cpp`:
    - Line 5382 in `PackLinuxElf32::elf_lookup()`
    - Line 5368 in `PackLinuxElf32::elf_lookup()`
    - Line 5404 in `PackLinuxElf64::elf_lookup()`
    - Line 5349 in `PackLinuxElf32::elf_lookup()`
- Insufficient bounds checking when accessing memory via pointers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to crashes from out-of-bounds reads.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input files.
- Specifically crafted ELF files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted input file to be processed by UPX.
- No special privileges required.
