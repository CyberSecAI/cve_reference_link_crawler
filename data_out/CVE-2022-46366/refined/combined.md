Subject: CVE-2022-46366: Apache Tapestry prior to version 4 (EOL) allows
 RCE though deserialization of untrusted input

Description:

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Apache Tapestry 3.x allows deserialization of untrusted data, leading to remote code execution. This issue is similar to but distinct from CVE-2020-17531, which applies the the (also unsupported) 4.x version line. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects Apache Tapestry version line 3.x, which is no longer supported by the maintainer. Users are recommended to upgrade to a supported version line of Apache Tapestry.

Apache would like to thank Ilyass El Hadi from Mandiant for reporting this issue

# MNDT-2022-0041

## Description

Apache Tapestry Framework version 3.x is affected by a unauthenticated Java unsafe deserialization vulnerability, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the underlying server.

## Impact

Very High - Exploiting the vulnerability could allow an attacker to completely compromise the application's underlying server.

## Exploitability

Medium - A review of the framework's source code is required in order to identify the proper exploitation steps. As such, automated scanners cannot identify this issue.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2022-46366

## Technical Details

Similar to CVE-2020-17531, the sp parameter's contents, which are under the end-user's control, will ultimately be deserialized. However, for the vulnerable application to deserialize the malicious Java serialized object, certain modifications must be made to the payload. The payload modifications required for successful exploitation differ from the deserialization vulnerability affecting version 4.x (CVE-2020-17531).

## Resolution

No patch to be released as the affected software is End-of-Life (EOL).

## Discovery Credits

Ilyass El Hadi, Mandiant
