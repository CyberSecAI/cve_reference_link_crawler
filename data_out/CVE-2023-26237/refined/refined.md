- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to bypass the Advanced Protection feature by setting a specific Windows registry key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an advanced protection bypass. The software does not properly validate registry settings related to the Advanced Protection feature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute binaries that have not been classified, thus bypassing security controls designed to prevent execution of malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the system where the affected software is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local access to the system and must have system-level privileges to modify the Windows registry.
