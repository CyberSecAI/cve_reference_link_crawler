Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities affecting D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the outdated firmware of the D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers. These devices have reached their End of Life (EOL) and End of Service Life (EOS) on December 31, 2015, meaning they no longer receive security updates or patches from D-Link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The reports detail multiple vulnerabilities, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Multiple reports indicate RCE vulnerabilities, particularly related to the `webmailattach.md`, `resmanage.php`, and `importhtml.md` files.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Several reports also identify arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities in the following files `licenseauthorization.php`, `onlineuser.php`, `resmanage.php`, `url.php`, and `urlblist.php`.
*   **SQL Injection:** There is a mention of a SQL injection vulnerability in `edit_manageadmin.php`, however, it's not directly associated with this advisory but is present in the same repository.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the affected routers, potentially gaining full control of the device.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the device, which can lead to various consequences such as further exploitation, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can use SQL injection to potentially access sensitive data in the database or execute malicious queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are web-based, utilizing the routers' web interfaces. It is highly likely that these vulnerabilities are accessible remotely if the router's management interface is exposed to the internet. The specific attack vectors are via:
* Webmail attachment handling (RCE).
* Handling of imported HTML files (RCE)
* Improper handling of the `resmanage.php` file (RCE and Arbitrary File Upload)
* Upload functionality in the following files: `licenseauthorization.php`, `onlineuser.php`, `url.php`, and `urlblist.php` (Arbitrary File Upload)
* SQL queries within `edit_manageadmin.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need network access to the affected routers' web interface.
*   For remote attacks, the router's web management interface would need to be exposed to the internet or an attacker would need to have access to the internal network.
*   The attacker would exploit the vulnerable endpoints mentioned to trigger RCE, arbitrary file upload, or SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes**

* The advisory explicitly states that the affected products are EOL/EOS and will not receive updates.
* The vulnerabilities were reported by multiple third-party security researchers.
* D-Link recommends that users retire and replace these devices.

In summary, the documents describe a range of severe vulnerabilities in the outdated D-Link DAR-7000 and DAR-8000 routers, including RCE, arbitrary file upload, and SQL injection, which pose significant security risks. The products have reached EOL and users should not continue to use them.
