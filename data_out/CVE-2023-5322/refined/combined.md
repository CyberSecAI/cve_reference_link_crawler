(Non-US) DAR-7000 / (Non-US) DAR-8000 :: All Models :; All Revisions :: End-of-Life / End-of-Service Life :: Multiple Report Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

Since September 16, 2023, a 3rd Party security VulDB CVE Vendor Coordination brought a security reports to D-Link's attention. D-Link appreicates the cooperative effort by VulDB in publishing accurate information of security incidents involving D-Link products. These disclosure reports are specifically for the DAR-7000/DAR-8000 hardware revision Ax.

This exploit affects a legacy D-Link router and all hardware revisions, which have reached their End of Life ("EOL")/End of Service Life ("EOS") Cycle on December 31, 2015.  Products that have reached their EOL/EOS no longer receive device software updates and security patches and are no longer supported by D-Link.

These products are not sold in the US; we would encourage you to find more information from the regional source at <http://www.dlink.com.cn>

D-Link US recommends that D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS be retired and replaced. Please get in touch with your regional office for recommendations.

Regardless of product type or sales channel, D-Link's general policy is that when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products ceases. Please read the information and recommendations below.

**Recommendation for End-of-Support/End-of-Life Products**

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL an effect due to the evolution of technology, market demands, innovations, and product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is usually no further extended support or development for it.

Typically, for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link US is prohibited from supporting these EOL/EOS products; if you are outside the US, please get in touch with your regional D-Link office. If your device was provided by a licensed carrier (service provider) and firmware, o get in touch with don’t hesitate to contact your carrier (service provider). Many devices on this list have available 3rd party open-firmware, D-Link does not support open-firmware, which voids any warranty and is solely the responsibility of the device's owner.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the last know firmware which can be located on the Legacy Website links above. Please make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
