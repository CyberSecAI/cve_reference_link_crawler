# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1862

## tddpd enable\_test\_mode command execution vulnerability

##### April 9, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-49133,CVE-2023-49134

##### SUMMARY

A command execution vulnerability exists in the tddpd enable\_test\_mode functionality of Tp-Link AC1350 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Access Point (EAP225 V3) v5.1.0 Build 20220926 and Tp-Link N300 Wireless Access Point (EAP115 V4) v5.0.4 Build 20220216. A specially crafted series of network requests can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can send a sequence of unauthenticated packets to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Tp-Link N300 Wireless Access Point (EAP115) v5.0.4 Build 20220216

Tp-Link AC1350 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Access Point (EAP225 V3) v5.1.0 Build 20220926

##### PRODUCT URLS

AC1350 Wireless MU-MIMO Gigabit Access Point (EAP225 V3) - <https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/omada-sdn-access-point/eap225/>
N300 Wireless Access Point (EAP115) - <https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/ceiling-mount-access-point/eap115/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.1 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-829 - Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

##### DETAILS

The EAP225(US) AC1350 Access Point is a wireless access point from TP-Link offering native integration with tp-link Omada Cloud SDN for centralized cloud management and zero-touch provisioning.

The EAP225 and EAP115 Wireless Access Points run various services to manage the access point. One such service is `tddpd` which listens on UDP port 1024 for the first 15 minutes after the device is restarted. By default, this service is running as the root user. The `tddpd` service exposes unauthenticated access to device functionality normally intended for troubleshooting activities. Implemented functionality appears to change depending on the device.

`tddpd` request messages consist of an 0x1C byte header followed by a data field only used by some commands, as shown below.

```
struct tddp_header {
    uint8_t version,          // protocol version (0x01 or 0x02)
    uint8_t type,             // TDDP_SPECIAL_CMD_OPT_Subtype (0x03) or TDDP_ENC_CMD_OPT_Subtype (0x07)
    uint8_t code,             // 0x01
    uint8_t direction,        // 0x00 for request
    uint32_t pay_len,         // number of bytes contained within the payload
    uint16_t pkt_id,          // 0x01
    uint8_t sub_type,         // TDDP_SPECIAL_CMD_OPT or TDDP_ENC_CMD_OPT depending on `type`
    uint8_t reserved,         // 0x00
    uint8_t[0x10] digest,     // MD5 digest of the message
}

```

The affected devices mainly use version 2 of the `tddp` service, implementing two of the available request types: `TDDP_SPECIAL_CMD_OPT` and `TDDP_ENC_CMD_OPT`. When a `TDDP_SPECIAL_CMD_OPT` request is chosen, the device loops over all of the available special command types searching for a matching function. Two of the available sub-requests (0x4B and 0x4F) cause the device to enter a Test Mode.

```
0040161c  int32_t _enableTestMode()
00401630      int32_t var_14 = 0
00401634      int32_t var_18 = 0
00401664      int32_t $v0 = wrpOpDo(0x240007, 0, 0, &var_14, 4, 0, 0x423640)
0040168c      int32_t var_10
0040168c      if ($v0 != 0 || ($v0 == 0 && var_14 != 0))
004016b0          printf("[TDDP_ERROR]<error>[%s:%d] faile…", "_enableTestMode", 0x14b)
004016c0          var_10 = 0xffffffff
0040168c      if ($v0 == 0 && var_14 == 0)
004016cc          var_10 = 0
004016dc      return var_10

```

A majority of core functionality on these devices is handled within a service called `uclited`, and the various network services simply provide a way of acccessing these functions over the network. In this case we focus on a functionality titled `enableTestMode`, which is only exposed via `tddpd`. This appears to be debugging/diagnotic functionality not intended for normal users. This functionality is rather straightforward in that it fetches a shell script via TFTP from a hard-coded IP address and executes it.

Using this vulnerablity, a properly positioned network attacker can manipulate the device into fetching and executing an untrusted shell script with root permissions.

#### CVE-2023-49133 - AC1350

On the AC1350 (EAP225 V3\_5.1.0 Build 20220926) the vulnerable function is located at offset `0x47b264`, which is titled `api_wlan_enableTestMode`. An annotated decompilation of this function is included below, for reference.

```
int32_t api_wlan_enableTestMode() {
    struct stat buf;
    memset(&buf, 0, 0x98);
    int32_t i;
    do {
        i = execFormatCmd("arping -I %s -c 1 192.168.0.100", "br0")                     // [1] Check for the existence of a system at 192.168.0.100
    } while (i == 1);
    execFormatCmd("tftp -g 192.168.0.100 -r test_mode_tp.sh -l /tmp/test_mode_tp.sh");  // [2] TFTP Get a file named `test_mode_tp.sh` from 192.168.0.100
    stat("/tmp/test_mode_tp.sh", &buf);
    int32_t result = 1;
    if (buf.st_size s> 0) {                                                             // [3] If the file was successfully fetched...
        execFormatCmd("chmod +x /tmp/test_mode_tp.sh");                                 // [4] Mark the file as executable
        execFormatCmd("/tmp/test_mode_tp.sh &");                                        // [5] and finally execute the shell script with root permissions
        result = 0;
    }
    return result;
}

```
#### CVE-2023-49134 - N300

On the N300 (EAP115 V4\_5.0.4 Build 20220216) the vulnerable function is located at offset `0x47159c`, which is titled `api_wlan_enableTestMode`. An annotated decompilation of this function is included below, for reference.

```
int32_t api_wlan_enableTestMode() {
    struct stat buf;
    memset(&buf, 0, 0x98);
    int32_t i;
    do {
        i = execFormatCmd("arping -I %s -c 1 192.168.0.100", "br0")                     // [1] Check for the existence of a system at 192.168.0.100
    } while (i == 1);
    execFormatCmd("tftp -g 192.168.0.100 -r test_mode_tp.sh -l /tmp/test_mode_tp.sh");  // [2] TFTP Get a file named `test_mode_tp.sh` from 192.168.0.100
    stat("/tmp/test_mode_tp.sh", &buf);
    int32_t result = 1;
    if (buf.st_size s> 0) {                                                             // [3] If the file was successfully fetched...
        execFormatCmd("chmod +x /tmp/test_mode_tp.sh");                                 // [4] Mark the file as executable
        execFormatCmd("/tmp/test_mode_tp.sh &");                                        // [5] and finally execute the shell script with root permissions
        result = 0;
    }
    return result;
}
