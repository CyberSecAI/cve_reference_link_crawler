{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hardcoded credentials in the main settings binary of the VONETS VAP11G-300 router.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded plaintext credentials within the `Http_handle` object of the settings binary.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the hardcoded credentials via the device's portal login (HTTP request).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to be able to reach the device's login portal to test the credentials.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability persists even after factory resets because the credentials are baked into the binary. The credentials `test:test` provides higher administrative privileges than the others."
