The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes CVE-2021-44413.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi` JSON command parser of the Reolink RLC-410W camera. Specifically, the code assumes that the "param" field within a JSON command is always a JSON object. If a different type is provided, it leads to an assertion failure and a subsequent device reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The `cgiserver.cgi` does not properly validate the type of the `param` field in the JSON commands. The code assumes it is an object and attempts to access it using the subscription operator as if it were an object, without checking its actual type first.
-   **Denial of Service:** Sending a crafted request with a non-object value for `param` in the "AddUser" command causes the `cgiserver.cgi` to assert and the device to reboot, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation of the vulnerability causes the camera to reboot, disrupting its functionality.
-   **Loss of Surveillance:** This reboot leads to a temporary loss of surveillance capabilities, potentially leaving the area unprotected.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The request must contain a JSON array in the body where a command is present with a "param" field that is not an object.
-   **Specifically, for CVE-2021-44413**: The "AddUser" command is used with a non-object value for the "param" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the camera.
-   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to know how to construct the specific HTTP request and JSON body format.
-   **Session Token or Authentication Bypass:**  While most of the vulnerable API calls would require a session token, the report notes that another vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) could be used to bypass the need for authentication in certain scenarios.
