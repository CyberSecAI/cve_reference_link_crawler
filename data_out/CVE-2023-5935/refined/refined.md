- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The local web interface provided by Arc during initial configuration lacks authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical functions (CWE-306).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker or malware can extract sensitive information, change Arc's configuration, or even achieve arbitrary code execution by installing a malicious update package.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine where Arc is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user or process with the ability to access the local web interface during the configuration window.
