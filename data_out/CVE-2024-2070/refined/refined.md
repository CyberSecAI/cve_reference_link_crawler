The provided content details a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "FAQ Management System Using PHP and MySQL" version 1.0, specifically in the `add-faq.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `add-faq.php` file. User-supplied data for the question and answer fields are directly inserted into the database without proper encoding or filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization. User-provided input containing malicious JavaScript is stored in the database and later displayed on the website, executing the injected script in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information like cookies (including session information) and send them to attacker-controlled servers.
- **Malicious requests:** Attackers can send malicious requests to the web application on behalf of the victim.
- **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.
- **Browser exploitation:** Attackers could potentially exploit browser vulnerabilities and compromise the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the FAQ Management System, specifically the `add-faq.php` page.
- Attacker submits crafted POST requests with malicious JavaScript code in the `question` and `answer` parameters to `add-faq.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `add-faq.php` page, which is used to add new FAQs to the system.
- The attacker requires no special privileges other than the ability to submit requests to the web application.
