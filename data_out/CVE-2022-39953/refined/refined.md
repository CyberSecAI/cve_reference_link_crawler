- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management in FortiNAC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A low privilege local user with shell access can execute arbitrary commands as root due to a flaw in how FortiNAC manages privileges. This is identified as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a low privilege local user to escalate their privileges to root, leading to complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker who already has low-level shell access to the FortiNAC system can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have low-privilege shell access to the vulnerable FortiNAC system.
