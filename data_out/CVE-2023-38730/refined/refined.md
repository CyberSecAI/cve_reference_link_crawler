Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management allows SSL/TLS connections using Diffie-Hellman moduli that are 1024 bits or smaller. These relatively small moduli are vulnerable to cryptanalysis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use of weak cryptographic algorithms:**  Specifically, the use of Diffie-Hellman key exchange with moduli of 1024 bits or less is considered weak in modern cryptographic standards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially recover the shared secret, allowing them to decrypt the communication and expose sensitive information being transmitted over the SSL/TLS connection (plaintext recovery).
*   **Violation of integrity:**  An attacker might be able to manipulate the communication, potentially causing data corruption or other integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network attack:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network through SSL/TLS connections to the affected service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or participate in the SSL/TLS connection between a client and the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management server.
*   **Computational resources:** The attacker requires sufficient computational resources to perform the cryptanalysis needed to break the weak Diffie-Hellman keys. The effort depends on the modulus size and the attackerâ€™s resources.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Spectrum Copy Data Management versions 2.2.0.0 through 2.2.19.0.
*   The fix is provided in version 2.2.20.0.
*   There are no workarounds or mitigations provided other than upgrading the software.
