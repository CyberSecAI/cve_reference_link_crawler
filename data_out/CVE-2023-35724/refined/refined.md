Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-35724

**Vulnerability:** D-Link DAP-2622 Telnet CLI Use of Hardcoded Credentials Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The Telnet CLI service on the D-Link DAP-2622 router contains hardcoded credentials.

**Weakness:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of hardcoded credentials within the Telnet CLI service. This bypasses the intended authentication mechanism.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows for authentication bypass on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the system via Telnet CLI.
*   **Full Control:** Exploitation could provide an attacker with full access to the device through the Telnet interface.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Network-Adjacent:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device.
*   **Telnet Protocol:** Exploitation occurs via the Telnet protocol, specifically port 23.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be network-adjacent to the target device.
*   **Basic Network Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the device's telnet port.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability allows for authentication bypass.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the CLI service listening on TCP port 23.
*   D-Link has released an update to address this vulnerability.
