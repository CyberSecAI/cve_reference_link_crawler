**CVE-2024-25420**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not remove a deleted administrative user's username from the `admin.authorizedJIDs` system property. This property stores the usernames of administrative users.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. Specifically, the lack of proper cleanup of administrative user data upon deletion.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: A new user created with the same username as a previously deleted administrator is automatically granted administrative privileges without proper authorization.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker can create a new user via XMPP registration with the same username as a deleted admin user.
    *   An attacker can brute-force commonly used admin usernames during registration.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Ability to register a new user, which can be done through the XMPP protocol.
    *   Knowledge of a previously existing administrator username. This can be obtained through OSINT.
    *   Network access to the vulnerable service.
