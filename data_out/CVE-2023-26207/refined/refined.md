- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information (SMTP passwords) into log files. Specifically, the passwords are included in ciphertext format within FortiOS and FortiProxy log events.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Exposure of sensitive information (SMTP passwords) in log files. This is a weakness related to logging practices and not sanitizing sensitive data before logging. [CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File]
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker with access to the logs can read SMTP passwords in ciphertext. While the passwords are not in plaintext, this information disclosure could potentially be used for further attacks if the ciphertext is weak or if the attacker is able to decrypt them.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker needs to have access to the log files where the sensitive information is recorded. This could be through compromised accounts or through other means of accessing the logging system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with the ability to access and read the log files generated by FortiOS or FortiProxy.
