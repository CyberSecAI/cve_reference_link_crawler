### Is there an existing issue for this?

* I have searched the existing issues

### Is your issue described in the documentation?

* I have read the documentation

### Is your issue present in the nightly release?

* This issue is present in the nightly release

### Describe the Bug

After unpairing all devices in the web UI interface and them pairing only one device, sunshine pair all of the previously devices again.

I have 3 paired devices through my lan using moonlight as client and sunshine as server. If I unpair all the devices in the Troubleshooting tab, then pair one device again, without removing the server in my moonlight clients, all of them are automatically paired again.

The only way to not have them paired without a pin again, is to forget the sunshine server in the moonlight client. If I do this, when pairing them, the pin is asked normally.

To reproduce it:

* Pair 2 or more devices in a sunshine server. Do as regular: type the pin for both in the sunshine web UI.
* Unpair all devices in the Troubleshooting tab. The server in all devices should have a locker. Do not forget the sunshine server in the devices.
* Pair only one device again, using the pin in the web UI.
* The other devices that were previously paired and forgotten by the sunshine server are now paired again without the need of a pin. i.e. the locker disappear and the connection to the stream is made successfully.

### Expected Behavior

After unpairing all devices, they should not be paired again without a pin even if the server are still present in the client.

### Additional Context

I was planning to stream my server to friends, but with this, even if I remove all paired clients, they will gain access to my computer without the need of my authorization again. Making the use for this case impossible.

# Clients removed during unpairing process may regain access if Sunshine was not restarted

Moderate

[ReenigneArcher](/ReenigneArcher)
published
GHSA-v8gw-jw28-v55m
Apr 7, 2024

## Package

sunshine

## Affected versions

>= 0.10.0, < 0.23.0

## Patched versions

v0.23.0

## Description

### Impact

After unpairing all devices in the web UI interface and then pairing only one device, all of the previously devices will be temporarily paired. Once Sunshine is restarted only the clients that were re-paired would have access, as intended.

### Patches

v0.23.0

### Workarounds

Restarting Sunshine after unpairing all devices prevents the vulnerability.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
