Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-0456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in APICast's OIDC (OpenID Connect) module when handling mismatched JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens from different realms. Specifically, the module fails to properly evaluate the response to a token from a different realm, leading to incorrect authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper JWT Handling:** The OIDC module does not properly handle exceptions when a JWT's `kid` (key ID) doesn't match, which indicates a token from a different realm.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the failure to catch the exception, the proxy module proceeds without properly evaluating the authorization.
*  **Incomplete Request to Backend:** The proxy module then sends an incomplete request to the backend, lacking the required authorization parameters.
* **Incorrect Caching with Routing Policy:** When the routing policy is enabled, the proxy module incorrectly assumes the JWT is cached, further contributing to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can potentially gain access to resources or APIs belonging to a different realm, without proper authorization. This can lead to the disclosure of unauthorized information.
*   **Bypass of Security Measures:** By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the intended security controls of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to generate a JWT token from a different realm than the one expected by the target application.
* The attacker sends a request to the gateway using a host and path that will match the targeted product.
*   The request is made to the APIcast gateway, specifically targeting an endpoint associated with a configured product.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to generate or obtain a JWT token from a different realm.
*   The attacker needs to know the target API endpoint/path configured in APICast.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The issue is triggered when a backend is configured with a public path different from "/".
*   The vulnerability is exacerbated when the routing policy is enabled.
*   A 404 "Not Found" from the backend can be used to identify this behavior
