# Blind SQL-injection in DAL aggregations

published
GHSA-p6w9-r443-r752

## Package

composer

shopware/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 6.5.8.12
>= 6.6.0.0 <=6.6.5.0

## Patched versions

6.5.8.13
6.6.5.1

composer

shopware/platform
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

<= 6.5.8.12
>= 6.6.0.0 <=6.6.5.0

6.5.8.13
6.6.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the “aggregations”

object. The ‘name’ field in this “aggregations” object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using SQL parameters.

### Patches

Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13

### Workarounds

For older versions of 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.

### Credit

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
