{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Lightweight Sidebar Manager plugin does not properly validate nonces when saving sidebar metabox data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can forge a request to save arbitrary metabox data if they can trick an administrator into clicking a link.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A forged request initiated by an attacker.",
      "Trick a site administrator into clicking on a link"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action that triggers the request."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2020-36747",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Lightweight Sidebar Manager",
    "versions": "<= 1.1.4"
  },
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists due to the metabox_save() function in the plugin not validating the nonce if the nonce parameter is not set in the request. This allows a CSRF attack because if the nonce isn't present, it won't be verified."
