    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code within the application's data store. When a victim user accesses this data through their browser, the malicious code executes within the context of the web application, potentially leading to information disclosure, session theft, or client-side request forgery.",
    "attack_vectors": "Adjacent network access.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a high privileged user within the adjacent network. They also need to be able to inject the malicious code. The user must then interact with the injected code through a web browser for the exploit to be triggered."
