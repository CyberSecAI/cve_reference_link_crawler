{
    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the virtio-net transmission component of Oracle VirtualBox. Specifically, the issue leads to an out-of-bounds read, where the software reads past the end of an allocated buffer.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Out-of-bounds read",
            "Lack of input validation"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading memory outside of the intended buffer. This could be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution in the context of the hypervisor.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Local access to the guest system",
             "Exploiting the virtio-net component"

        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest system."
