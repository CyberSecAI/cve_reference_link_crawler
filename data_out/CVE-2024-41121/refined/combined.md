# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

| Getting privileged permissions using an escalated plugin by adjusting workspace Dear Woodpecker Security Team,  I am writing to inform you about the possibility of running arbitrary code in a privileged container using the default configuration. As you know, the default configuration has multiple containers that run in privileged mode. These include the "plugins/docker" image. (I haven't looked at the other images, though I'm sure they are vulnerable to the same or similar exploits.) My POC uses the workspace attribute with the base set to "/use/local". This way, I can place a file at "/usr/local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh" in a step before the "plugins/docker" step to overwrite the commands executed in the privileged container.  ``` workspace:   base: /usr/local/  steps: - name: prepare   image: alpine   commands:     - mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/     - cp fake-local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh     - cp ncat /usr/local/ncat     - cp bash /usr/local/bash     - chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dockerd-entrypoint.sh     - chmod +x /usr/local/ncat     - chmod +x /usr/local/bash - name: drone   image: plugins/docker  ```  This is possible because the only things checked before allowing the setting of the container to privileged are that the "Commands" and "Entrypoint" attributes are unset using the "IsPlugin" function. There are multiple other ways to gain code execution in the privileged container, such as setting environment variables like "LD\_PRELOAD".  I only tested this in the docker runner, but looking at the code, the same should be possible for the kubernetes runner.  I'm not sure how to fix this correctly, as it is broken by design when allowing the building of docker images inside the CI.  Similar bugs exist in the Drone CI, so a scheduled disclosure with them makes sense.  I am also informing you that I am the author of a CTF Challenge where people tried to find and exploit this bug. The event was a final to a qualification with a small number of participants. Two Teams solved the challenge by finding other bugs. I will tell them to report their found vulnerability as well.  Feel free to follow up with any questions.
