Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how the ksmbd (kernel SMB daemon) handles compound SMB2 requests. Specifically, the functions `smb2_get_ksmbd_tcon` and `smb2_check_user_session` incorrectly used `smb2_get_msg` to retrieve the SMB2 header. This function always returns the *first* header in a compound request, regardless of the current command being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Header Retrieval:** The core issue is that `smb2_get_msg` does not correctly iterate through the headers of a compound request. This leads to using the initial request's session ID and tree ID for subsequent operations within the same compound request.
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** When a `SMB2_TREE_CONNECT_HE` command is the first operation in a compound request, the `smb2_get_ksmbd_tcon` function would effectively skip the tree ID check because `smb2_get_msg` would return 0, causing the `tree_id` variable to be uninitialized and the check to be skipped. Similarly, the session ID check in `smb2_check_user_session` was also affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass session and tree ID validation checks. This could lead to:

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker might be able to connect to a shared resource using a different tree ID than expected, potentially accessing files or resources they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Session Hijacking:** It might be possible to perform actions within a session without proper authorization, if the session ID check is bypassed.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, incorrect session/tree handling could destabilize the ksmbd service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SMB2 Compound Requests:** The attack vector is sending a specially crafted SMB2 compound request to the ksmbd server. This request would need to be structured to have a `SMB2_TREE_CONNECT_HE` command as the first command in the compound request in order to trigger the vulnerability with the tree id check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the target ksmbd server using the SMB protocol.
*   **Knowledge of SMB2 Protocol:** The attacker must have a sufficient understanding of the SMB2 protocol to craft malicious compound requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves replacing `smb2_get_msg` with `ksmbd_req_buf_next`, which correctly iterates through the commands within a compound request, ensuring that the right header is being used for each operation and the checks are properly performed.
*   The commit messages all point to the same root cause and fix, with different commits applying the patch to different branches of the kernel.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) under the identifier ZDI-CAN-21506.

In summary, this vulnerability allowed attackers to potentially bypass session and tree ID checks in compound SMB2 requests, and was due to incorrect header retrieval in the ksmbd module. The fix replaces the flawed `smb2_get_msg` with `ksmbd_req_buf_next` to iterate through the commands in the compound request.
