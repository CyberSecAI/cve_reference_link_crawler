The provided content relates to CVE-2023-36671.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how VPN clients handle routing exceptions, specifically regarding traffic destined for the VPN server's IP address.  VPN clients typically exclude traffic to the VPN server's IP from being routed through the VPN tunnel to avoid routing loops.  The vulnerability is caused by the fact that the VPN client does not verify the real IP address of the VPN server, and trusts the address it receives in DNS responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **ServerIP attack:** The core vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to spoof the DNS response for the VPN server's hostname. By providing a malicious IP address, the attacker can trick the victim's device into adding a routing rule that sends traffic destined for that IP address *outside* of the VPN tunnel. This traffic would normally be encapsulated by the VPN.
- **Routing rule manipulation**: VPN clients add a routing rule to send traffic to the IP address of the VPN server outside the VPN tunnel in order to prevent routing loops. This rule can be exploited by attackers.
- **Lack of IP verification:** The VPN client does not verify the IP address of the VPN server. It trusts the spoofed address in the DNS reply.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Traffic leakage:** An attacker can intercept and read traffic that is supposed to be protected by the VPN tunnel. This includes sensitive data like login credentials, browsing history and other information transmitted to insecure websites or older protocols.
- **Privacy breach:** Even if traffic to websites is encrypted by HTTPS, the attack reveals *which* websites a user is visiting, which is a privacy concern.
- **Attacks on older protocols:** VPNs are often used to protect older, insecure protocols like RDP, POP, FTP, and telnet. This vulnerability allows an attacker to remove the VPN protection of these protocols, exposing them to attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Wi-Fi networks:** An attacker can set up a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot to perform DNS spoofing and intercept traffic.
- **Malicious ISPs:** A malicious internet service provider can perform DNS spoofing and intercept traffic.
- **Compromised Internet routers:** An attacker who has compromised an internet router can perform DNS spoofing and intercept traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify DNS responses before the VPN is enabled.
- **Visibility of VPN server traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to see the traffic going to the real VPN server, in order to redirect it.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to either control the Wi-Fi network or be in a position to perform DNS spoofing (e.g., malicious ISP or compromised router).

**CVE-2023-36671 Specifics**
CVE-2023-36671 is specifically related to the ServerIP attack where only traffic to the real IP address of the VPN server can be leaked. This is a variant of the more general ServerIP attack (CVE-2023-36673) where an arbitrary IP address can be used to leak traffic.
