Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2017-10116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the "Security" subcomponent of the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, and JRockit components of the Oracle Java SE platform. It stems from a flaw in how `LDAPCertStore` handles referrals. It allows an attacker to potentially redirect connections to non-LDAP URLs, which may result in a compromise of the Java installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:**  The vulnerability is classified as an "Improper Access Control", leading to the ability to compromise the Java SE environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of CVE-2017-10116 can lead to a "takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit". The nature of the takeover is not further detailed but implies complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access through "multiple protocols".
*   **Human Interaction:** Exploitation "requires human interaction from a person other than the attacker". This suggests that an attacker needs a user to perform some action to complete the exploit.
*   **Sandboxed Environments:** The vulnerability is exploitable through "sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets".
*   **API Data:** The flaw can also be triggered by "supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Network Access:** Attackers can be unauthenticated, gaining access to vulnerable components over the network.
*   **Social Engineering** The attacker needs a user to interact with the exploit. This might include luring them to a malicious site or other means of tricking them into loading malicious java components.

**Technical Details & Descriptions**

*   The vulnerability is described as "difficult to exploit", but the impact can be "significant".
*   The vulnerability is associated with "LDAPCertStore following referrals to non-LDAP URLs".
*   The vulnerability impacts the following:
    *   Java SE: 6u151, 7u141, and 8u131
    *   Java SE Embedded: 8u131
    *   JRockit: R28.3.14

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered without the use of applets through methods like web services, emphasizing the need for secure API interaction.
*   Several products across multiple vendors are identified as affected, specifically NetApp and Phoenix Contact.
*   Patches and workarounds involve updating Java to versions that contain a fix for this CVE.
