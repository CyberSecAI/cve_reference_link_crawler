  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A crafted SVM model with a large value in the `_n_support` array can cause a segmentation fault when `svm_predict_values` is called within the libsvm library, as used by scikit-learn.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when the `_n_support` array within a Support Vector Machine model is modified to contain a large value, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
      "The scikit-learn library did not validate the consistency between `_n_support` and `support_vectors`, allowing for exploitation via crafted models."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious actor can cause a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of the application using the library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious SVM model with a large value in the `_n_support` array.",
      "The crafted model can be introduced via pickle, JSON, or any other model persistence technique."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SVM model to a scikit-learn application."

       "resolution": "The vulnerability is resolved by implementing an internal consistency check between the `_n_support` array and the `support_vectors` within the SVC and SVR classes, raising a `ValueError` if an inconsistency is found. This prevents the segfault."
