 From my understanding of Git commit
94062790aedb505bdda209b10bea47b294d6394f
(<URL:<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=94062790aedb505bdda209b10bea47b294d6394f>>),
this appears to be a race condition where a program (running locally)
calls connect(2) and then shutdown(2) without actually attempting to
transfer any data, with a further constraint that certain packets (I am
unsure precisely what) must have been transferred such that the TCP
connection is half-opened.  It *might* be possible to cause this crash
remotely if a program attempts to set up a unidirectional TCP connection
(achieved by shutting down the undesired direction) but I am unsure if
any such programs are actually in use.

I would need to further study the Linux networking code to be sure, but
a comment updated in the patch seems to imply that this is an edge case
that was previously believed to be impossible to reach.  I suspect NIST
labeled it "network" because TCP is involved, but as of this writing
<URL:<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36905>> says "This
vulnerability is currently awaiting analysis." so I would expect NIST's
indication to be revised after that analysis is completed.

Again, this issue is probably only remotely exploitable if the host is
running a very unusual client program, but a local exploit can supply
the required oddly-behaving program.
