NIST doesn't appear to provide their own CVSS vectors/scores lately.
However, they republish (with attribution) some third-party ones, this
time from CISA-ADP.  The CISA-ADP CVSS vector for this vulnerability
specifies that it not only is network-reachable, but also that it has
High impact not only on Availability, but also on Confidentiality and
Integrity.  This results in a CVSSv3.1 score of 9.8.  Even merely
correcting the vector not to claim any Confidentiality and Integrity
impact (as a divide-by-zero generally does not have that) would bring
the score down significantly.

So a question for this list/thread may be - where/how may we dispute
CISA-ADP analysis?  Maybe someone would reply with specific contact info
for them, and Joel would proceed with that.

Also, this bug existed since prehistoric times.  The commit referenced
above says:

Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")

This is git commit from 2005, which says "Initial git repository build."

If the issue were in fact network-reachable with low access complexity
and no user interaction required (as the CISA-ADP CVSS vector claims),
then we'd have had plenty of Linux systems on the Internet crashing with
divide-by-zero in the kernel very often.  Since we didn't notice that,
and since the bug doesn't involve e.g. any magic numbers, this disproves
that it's easily triggerable over network in typical setups.

Joel wasn't subscribed to oss-security at the time, but has since
subscribed and wanted to post a follow-up question, which I am doing to
add it to the thread:

"Thanks for your reply Jacob.
Anyone able to comment about Red Hat or AWS justifications on this CVE ?"

To me, the above is already that kind of comment, but perhaps Joel would
like to hear specifically from Red Hat and AWS.
