 shutdown of TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

Hello
First thanks to Alexander for reposting because I was not able to do so!
You're right Clemens, I have myself ask the question on this github (<https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues/130>), but still no information for the moment.
Joel

I think the source for the CISA-ADP data is at [1]. For this specific CVE, the relevant file would be [2]. Their readme has a section at the bottom, where they encourage feedback:

> We want to hear from you, the IT cybersecurity professional community, about Vulnrichment and ADP! If you see something, please feel free to say something in the Issues, or even better, open a Pull Request with your suggested fix.

I’m aware of at last one prior case where a similar case of (IMHO) overblown CVSS scores was discussed in an issue on this particular GitHub project [3].

Somebody seems to already have opened a ticket for this CVE, too: [4]

[1]: <https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment>
[2]: <https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/blob/develop/2024/36xxx/CVE-2024-36905.json>
[3]: <https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues/93>
[4]: <https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues/130>

HTH,
Clemens
