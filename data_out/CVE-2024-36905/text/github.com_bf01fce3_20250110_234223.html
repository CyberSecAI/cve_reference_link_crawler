## Description

![@joelguittet](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6479682?u=e2e8c023401f4f058dc5e5805c44bd9014d6d3a2&v=4&size=48)[joelguittet](https://github.com/joelguittet)opened [on Nov 7, 2024](https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues/130#issue-2640363028)

Hello,

I would like to ask a clarification about the CVE-2024-36905. You indicate it is a network attack vector. Can you elaborate why ?

Both [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-36905) and [AWS](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2024-36905.html) classify the CVE with a local attack vector. Note I don't know why either.

Thanks for the feedbacks

Joel

PS: NIST currently check for this database to populate their own and so they currently indicate a network attack vector but the CVE is still indicated waiting for analysis. This is the path I followed to open this issue.
