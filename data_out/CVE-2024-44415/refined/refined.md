  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The strcpy function is used without checking the length of the string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unspecified, but typically leads to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is in the `dbsrv_asp` function of the D-Link DI-8200 router.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to send a crafted string to the vulnerable function to trigger the buffer overflow."
