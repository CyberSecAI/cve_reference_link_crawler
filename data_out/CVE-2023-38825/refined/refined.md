**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can dump all data from the database.
- An attacker can obtain password reset keys and change the passwords of any REDCap user, including the admin.
- Full account takeover including admin access

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request to the `/<redcap_version>/MyCapMobileApp/update.php` API.
- Malicious payload injected through the `$_POST['index_modal_update']` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be logged in as a REDCap user.
- The user must have one or more instruments enabled as MyCap tasks.
