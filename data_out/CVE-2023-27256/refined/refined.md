Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check in the `GetLogFiles` method of IDAttend's IDWeb application. This lack of authentication allows unauthorized access to sensitive log files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the **missing authentication** on a function that handles access to sensitive data. This is an instance of an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve sensitive log files. The content doesn't specify the exact type of sensitive information stored in the log files.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `GetLogFiles` method in IDAttend's IDWeb application, which is accessible over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `GetLogFiles` method over the network; no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in version `3.1.013` of IDAttendâ€™s IDWeb application.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version `3.1.053`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jack Misiura, working on behalf of The Missing Link Security.
