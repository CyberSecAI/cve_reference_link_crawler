Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1770

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted input within the `get_post_data` function. The plugin was directly using `get_post_meta` which could retrieve serialized data and not sanitizing it before unserializing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **PHP Object Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the injection of a PHP object through the deserialization of untrusted data. This is due to the usage of the `unserialize()` function on data retrieved from the WordPress database without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution (Conditional):** While the vulnerable plugin itself doesn't have a readily exploitable "POP chain" (a sequence of method calls that can be triggered during unserialization to achieve code execution), if a POP chain is present in another plugin or the active theme, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion/Retrieval:** With a suitable POP chain, an attacker could delete or retrieve sensitive files on the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Access:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Full System Compromise:** In cases where code execution is achieved, a full system compromise can be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through the WordPress application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Subscriber" level access or higher.
*   **Access to WordPress:** Requires access to a vulnerable WordPress install, using the plugin.
*   **Knowledge of POP Chain:**  An additional POP chain is required from another plugin or theme to achieve code execution. The vulnerable plugin does not provide one.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in Meta Tag Manager plugin versions <= 3.0.2.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.
* The patch involves removing `maybe_unserialize` and adding an explicit check with `is_serialized()` and sanitizing the unserialized output, ensuring only permitted object classes can be unserialized.
