- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Template Injection in the Email Templates feature of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when processing email templates, allowing for the injection of malicious template code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary code on the Jira server leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject malicious template code through the Email Templates feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrator permissions to modify email templates.
