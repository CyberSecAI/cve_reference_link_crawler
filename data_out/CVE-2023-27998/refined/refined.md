- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of custom error pages in FortiPresence allows an attacker to access sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper error handling (CWE-756), specifically the absence of custom error pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An unauthenticated attacker can navigate to specific HTTP(s) paths and potentially gain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Navigating to specific HTTP(s) paths on the FortiPresence login GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to navigate to the login GUI but does not need to be authenticated.
