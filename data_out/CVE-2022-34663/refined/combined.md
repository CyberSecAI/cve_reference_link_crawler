WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access in affected system(s) to ports 443/TCP and 22/TCP, to trusted IP addresses

only

• Disable the webserver: Via the Command Line Interface (CLI), go to “Administration”, “Configure IP
Services”, “Web Server Users Allowed” and change it to “Disabled” using the keyboard’s up/down
arrow keys

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM ROS-based devices, typically switches and serial-to-Ethernet devices, are used to connect
devices that operate in harsh environments such as electric utility substations and traffic control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34663

Affected devices are vulnerable to a web-based code injection attack via the console.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject code into the web server and cause malicious
behavior in legitimate users accessing certain web resources on the affected device.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CWE

8.0
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
