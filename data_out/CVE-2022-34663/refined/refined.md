- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a web-based code injection attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') - CWE-94. This allows an attacker to inject code into the web server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject code into the web server, causing malicious behavior when legitimate users access certain web resources on the affected device. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of services.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is web-based and requires prior access to the system via the Command Line Interface (CLI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs access to the system via the CLI. The attack also requires user interaction (UI:R) for successful exploitation on affected web resources.

The advisory provides a detailed list of affected products and versions, along with remediation recommendations and mitigations, which include:
*   Restricting network access to ports 443/TCP and 22/TCP to trusted IP addresses only
*   Disabling the webserver via the CLI
*   Updating to the latest software version.
