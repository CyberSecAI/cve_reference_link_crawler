{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the `WAV_CreateFile` function of the Watchdog AV driver, specifically how it handles file creation requests via the `IOCTL_WAV_CREATE_FILE` IOCTL. It does not properly validate access rights when creating a file handle, leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The driver uses an IOCTL to create file handles, and it appears to improperly handle the security context of the caller when creating a new handle. Specifically, the driver does not validate if the caller has the rights to open the file with the requested access mode.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A low-integrity user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain a handle to a file with write access, even if they normally wouldn't have the permission to do so, by sending a crafted IOCTL to the driver. This can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to overwrite system files or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via a crafted IOCTL call to the driver. The attacker must be able to open a handle to the vulnerable device, usually done by calling `CreateFileA` on the device path `\\\\.\\wsdk`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system as a low integrity user. They also need to know the device path of the vulnerable driver (`\\\\.\\wsdk`)."
