{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function `saveParentControlInfo` reads a user-provided parameter `time` without any length check, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute a denial of service attack or potentially achieve remote code execution by providing carefully crafted overflow data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted request to the `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint with an overly long 'time' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device."
