## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Helpful < 4.5.26 - Information Disclosure

### Description

The plugin puts the exported logs and feedbacks in a publicly accessible location and guessable names, which could allow attackers to download them and retrieve sensitive information such as IP, Names and Email Address depending on the plugin's settings

### Proof of Concept

After an admin export logs (via wp-admin/admin.php?page=helpful&tab=log) or feedbacks (wp-admin/admin.php?page=helpful\_feedback), the CSV files can be downloaded by simply accessing the following URLs:
https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/helpful/logs.csv
https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/helpful/feedback.csv
