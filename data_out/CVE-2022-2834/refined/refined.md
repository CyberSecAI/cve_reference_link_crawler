- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin stores exported logs and feedbacks in publicly accessible locations with predictable file names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure, sensitive data exposure. The plugin fails to restrict access to exported CSV files containing logs and feedback. The files are placed in the `wp-content/uploads/helpful` directory, and are accessible without authentication. The filenames are predictable (`logs.csv` and `feedback.csv`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can download the exported logs and feedback, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, such as IP addresses, names, and email addresses, depending on the plugin's settings and the data collected.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated access to the publicly available CSV files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no special privileges or access to the application other than network connectivity to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress instance. They only need to know the file location to retrieve the data.
