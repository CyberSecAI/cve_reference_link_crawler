# DoS vulnerability in opentelemetry-instrumentation-{instrumentation} (uncontrolled resource consumption) - due to unbound cardinality metrics

High

[ocelotl](/ocelotl)
published
GHSA-5rv5-6h4r-h22v
Oct 2, 2023

## Package

pip

opentelemetry-instrumentation
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.17.0/0.38b0

## Patched versions

>=1.20.0/0.41b0

## Description

### Summary

Autoinstrumentation out of the box adds the label `http_method` that has unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent.

### Details

HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long.

### PoC

Send many requests with long randomly generated HTTP methods and observe how memory consumption increases during it. The app can be like [this example from the official docs](https://opentelemetry-python-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instrumentation/flask/flask.html#id1).

### Impact

In order to be affected program has to be instrumented for HTTP handlers and does not filter any unknown HTTP methods on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc.

### Proposed solution

For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `UNKNOWN` non-standard HTTP methods to show that such requests were made (and this way does not increase cardinality). In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow it. The mechanism with environment variables can be reused - introduce the variable `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_CAPTURE_ALL_METHODS` that will allow enabling current behavior when someone really wants it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
