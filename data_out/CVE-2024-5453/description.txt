The ProfileGrid â€“ User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the pm_dismissible_notice and pm_wizard_update_group_icon functions in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary options to the value '1' or change group icons.
