- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect validation of allowed event types in a calendar web service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control. The system fails to properly validate the event types a user is allowed to create.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Some users can create calendar events with types/audiences they don't have permission to publish to. This could lead to unauthorized access to calendar data, potential information disclosure, or unauthorized modifications to calendar entries.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the calendar web service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user who has access to the calendar web service. They do not need to be an administrator or have any special privileges.
