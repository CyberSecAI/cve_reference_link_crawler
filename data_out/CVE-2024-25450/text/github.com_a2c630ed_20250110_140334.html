| Hi there.  There is no proper handling of the allocation of a buffer with an invalid size.  The invalid memory allocation happens in the function init\_imlib\_fonts() when called in the function main().  (The function is hidden as ?? in our report but is called in main.c:59)  Here is the output of the gdb results.

| Hi, thanks for the report!  This is an Imlib2 issue and cannot be fixed by feh. I also cannot reproduce it with a more recent Imlib2 version (1.10.0), so I'll assume that the bug no longer exists.  Let me know if you can reproduce it with that Imlib2 version or if there is something that I'm missing and that needs to be addressed in feh. I'll reopen the issue in that case. |

| Thanks for the confirmation! As I pointed out in issue [#709](https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/709), the bug is reproducible by default imlib2 package provided by Ubuntu 20 and 22, which is imlib2 <=1.9.1. And even the imlib2 of the version with the bug fix cannot be compiled. How about changing the default requirement of the imlib2 version to more than 1.9.1? |
