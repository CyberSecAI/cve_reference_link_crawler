Hi I am Heewon and I am writing to bring to your attention four vulnerabilities that our security team recently identified in imlib2. Although these issues have been addressed in your latest updates, we have observed that prior versions remain susceptible to exploitation.

Our intent is to request Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers for these vulnerabilities to ensure accurate and standardized communication within the cybersecurity community.

The vulnerabilities have already been fixed in your most recent releases, but the potential risk persists for users who have not yet updated to the latest versions.

Moreover, installing feh with the Debian-provided packages (imlib2 1.6.1 on Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS and imlib2 1.7.4 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) via apt may lead to severe problems, which is common behavior to users.

Here is a brief summary of the identified vulnerabilities along with the pertinent details:

CVE-2023-XXX1: [Description of Vulnerability 1]

* Fixed in version 1.10.0
* Still vulnerable versions to 1.9.1
* url: <https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/709>

CVE-2023-XXX2: [Description of Vulnerability 2]

* Fixed in version 1.10.0
* Still vulnerable versions to 1.9.1
* url: <https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/710>

CVE-2023-XXX3: [Description of Vulnerability 3]

* Fixed in version 1.10.0
* Still vulnerable versions to 1.9.1
* url: [<https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/711>

CVE-2023-XXX4: [Description of Vulnerability 4]

* Fixed in version 1.10.0
* Still vulnerable versions to 1.9.1
* url: [<https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/712>

We believe that assigning CVEs to these vulnerabilities will serve as a valuable reference for users who may still be operating on earlier software versions. This information will aid in facilitating effective communication, understanding, and mitigation efforts across the security community.

We kindly request that you escalate this matter to the relevant department within your organization responsible for CVE assignments. If your organization follows a specific process for such requests, please provide guidance on the steps we should follow.

Understanding that you are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of your software, we appreciate your attention to this matter. Should you require any additional information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to continued collaboration in enhancing the security of imlib2.

Hello, and thanks for the bug report(s).

The issues are all caused by the TGA loader bug fixed by [`e9c09deb08`](https://git.enlightenment.org/old/legacy-imlib2/commit/e9c09deb08047c9e902ce37144e82b6edb8aedb6) (included first in v1.10.0).

At least some of the bug descriptions are somewhat misleading. The problems are all caused by memory corruption due to an indexing bug in the tgaflip() function.

This memory corruption can probably manifest itself in countless interesting ways.

If distributions chose to ship imlib2 versions with known vulnerabilities there is not much we can do about it.

as [@kw](https://git.enlightenment.org/kw) said. rthis is fixed in 1.10 - the solution is to upgrade to 1.10. 1.9.1 by definition can NEVER be fixed as you cannot (or well never should - ever) modify an already released version silently without a new version number.

as such there is no system for handling CVE's here, there is little point doing anything. if a bug (security or otherwise) is brought to our attention and then is fixed - that's it - bug is fixed. upgrade to that release with the fix. that's what we do. nothing more. if someone wants to make a song and dance about it with VCE filings and paperwork and what not... that's up to them. :)

| Hi, thanks for the report!  This is an Imlib2 issue and cannot be fixed by feh. I also cannot reproduce it with a more recent Imlib2 version (1.10.0), so I'll assume that the bug no longer exists.  Let me know if you can reproduce it with that Imlib2 version or if there is something that I'm missing and that needs to be addressed in feh. I'll reopen the issue in that case. |

| Thanks for the confirmation! As I pointed out in issue [#709](https://github.com/derf/feh/issues/709), the bug is reproducible by default imlib2 package provided by Ubuntu 20 and 22, which is imlib2 <=1.9.1. And even the imlib2 of the version with the bug fix cannot be compiled. How about changing the default requirement of the imlib2 version to more than 1.9.1? |
