- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `getObject` method of the `ContentRestController` class, which fails to properly validate a user-supplied path before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of proper path validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can disclose sensitive information within the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks exploiting the `getObject` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, making the vulnerability remotely exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.
