- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from how the OAuth2 filter in Envoy processes the `HOST` header and the `OauthExpires` cookie. Specifically, the filter's HMAC validation logic can be manipulated by an attacker to create a valid signature for an arbitrarily large expiration time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inconsistent handling of host header including port numbers during the OAuth2 flow.
    - Lack of proper parsing and validation of the `OauthExpires` cookie before applying the HMAC signature.
    - The use of millisecond epoch for expiration parsing instead of seconds, which amplifies the impact of manipulated expiration times.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain permanent access to services behind Envoy until the HMAC secret used by Envoy is rotated, effectively bypassing the intended access control mechanisms. This results in a long-term compromise of the service's security and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client can manipulate the `HOST` header during the OAuth2 login flow and subsequently modify the `OauthExpires` cookie to achieve a very large expiration time.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the OAuth2 login flow.
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP headers (`HOST` header) and cookies.
    - No specific privileges required as long as the above two conditions are met.
