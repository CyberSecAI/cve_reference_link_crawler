Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted directory traversal flaw within the "sourcecodester Clinic's Patient Management System v1.0".
*   Specifically, the `/pms/user_images/` directory is directly accessible and vulnerable to traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Directory Traversal:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when accessing files, allowing attackers to navigate to directories outside of the intended webroot. This allows them to access files and directories they should not have access to.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system doesn't check or restrict the user's ability to traverse directories using characters like `../`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive server information, including configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other critical data, by accessing files and directories on the server through directory traversal.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable `/pms/user_images/` directory without any authentication or restriction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web application server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication. This implies the vulnerability is present in publicly accessible parts of the web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided link to the github repository confirms the vulnerability.
*   The proof of concept (POC) provided is a simple attempt to directly access the vulnerable directory, which should result in the ability to list the contents of the directory and then potentially navigate upwards using relative paths (`../`).
