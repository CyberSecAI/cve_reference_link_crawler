Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2342

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and lack of proper preparation of user-supplied parameters within SQL queries. Specifically, the `customer_id` parameter was not adequately escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin directly incorporates unsanitized user input into SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Extraction:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, configuration details, or other confidential information.
- **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:**  SQL injection could potentially allow for unauthorized modification or deletion of data within the database, if the database user has the necessary permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered via the use of a shortcode in the WordPress plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least "Contributor" level access.
- **Plugin Usage:** Attackers need to be able to use shortcodes of the vulnerable plugin to trigger the injection.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** Attackers need to know the `customer_id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c from CERT PL.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin" up to and including version 1.6.7.7.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.7.9.
- The fix involves using `$wpdb->prepare()` instead of direct string concatenation to build SQL queries.
