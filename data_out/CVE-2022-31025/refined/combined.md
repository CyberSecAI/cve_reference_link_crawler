SECURITY: Remove auto approval when redeeming an invite ([#16974](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16974))

```
This security fix affects sites which have `SiteSetting.must_approve_users`
enabled. There are intentional and unintentional cases where invited
users can be auto approved and are deemed to have skipped the staff approval process.
Instead of trying to reason about when auto-approval should happen, we have decided that
enabling the `must_approve_users` setting going forward will just mean that all new users
must be explicitly approved by a staff user in the review queue. The only case where users are auto
approved is when the `auto_approve_email_domains` site setting is used.

### @gschlager **[gschlager](/gschlager)** commented [Jun 2, 2022](#issue-1258189658)

This security fix affects sites which have `SiteSetting.must_approve_users`

enabled. There are intentional and unintentional cases where invited

users can be auto approved and are deemed to have skipped the staff approval process.

Instead of trying to reason about when auto-approval should happen, we have decided that

enabling the `must_approve_users` setting going forward will just mean that all new users

must be explicitly approved by a staff user in the review queue. The only case where users are auto

approved is when the `auto_approve_email_domains` site setting is used.

Sorry, something went wrong.

FIX: Approves user when redeeming an invite for invites only sites ([#…](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984)

[…16984](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984))

When a site has `SiteSetting.invite_only` enabled, we create a
`ReviewableUser`record when activating a user if the user is not
approved. Therefore, we need to approve the user when redeeming an
invite.

There are some uncertainties surrounding why a `ReviewableRecord` is
created for a user in an invites only site but this commit does not seek
to address that.

### @tgxworld **[tgxworld](/tgxworld)** commented [Jun 3, 2022](#issue-1259301488)

When a site has `SiteSetting.invite_only` enabled, we create a

`ReviewableUser`record when activating a user if the user is not

approved. Therefore, we need to approve the user when redeeming an

invite.

There are some uncertainties surrounding why a `ReviewableRecord` is

created for a user in an invites only site but this commit does not seek

to address that.

# Invite bypasses user approval

Low

[jomaxro](/jomaxro)
published
GHSA-x7jh-mx5q-6f9q
Jun 3, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.3; beta <= 2.9.0.beta4; tests-passed <= 2.9.0.beta4

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.8.4; beta >= 2.9.0.beta5; tests-passed >= 2.9.0.beta5

## Description

### Impact

Inviting users on sites that use SSO could bypass the `must_approve_users` check and invites by staff are always approved automatically.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest `stable`, `beta` and `tests-passed` versions of Discourse

### Workarounds

Disable invites. Administrators can increase min\_trust\_level\_to\_allow\_invite to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users (e.g. trust level 4).

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-31025

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
