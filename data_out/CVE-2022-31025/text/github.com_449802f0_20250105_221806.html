### @tgxworld **[tgxworld](/tgxworld)** commented [Jun 3, 2022](#issue-1259301488)

When a site has `SiteSetting.invite_only` enabled, we create a

`ReviewableUser`record when activating a user if the user is not

approved. Therefore, we need to approve the user when redeeming an

invite.

There are some uncertainties surrounding why a `ReviewableRecord` is

created for a user in an invites only site but this commit does not seek

to address that.

| [@tgxworld](https://github.com/tgxworld) there are failing specs but they don't *seem* related, around group ordering. Probably just flakes. |
