FIX: Approves user when redeeming an invite for invites only sites ([#…](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984)

```
[…16984](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984))

When a site has `SiteSetting.invite_only` enabled, we create a
`ReviewableUser`record when activating a user if the user is not
approved. Therefore, we need to approve the user when redeeming an
invite.

There are some uncertainties surrounding why a `ReviewableRecord` is
created for a user in an invites only site but this commit does not seek
to address that.
