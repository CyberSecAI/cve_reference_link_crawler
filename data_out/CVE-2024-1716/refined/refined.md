### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check in the `update_form()` function of the Admin Bar Remover plugin.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities
- **Missing Authorization:** The `update_form()` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user, including subscribers, to modify the plugin's settings.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** Attackers with subscriber-level access can enable or disable the admin bar on the front-end of the site. This could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.

### Attack vectors
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.
