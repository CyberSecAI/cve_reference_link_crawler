- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected product uses the MD5 algorithm to hash passwords before storing them but does not salt the hash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (MD5 without salting).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers may be able to crack the hashed passwords, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
