* **Equipment:** Mimosa by Airspan product line
* **Vulnerabilities:** Improper Authorization, Incorrect Authorization, Server-side Request Forgery, SQL Injection, Deserialization of Untrusted Data, OS Command Injection, Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain user data (including organization details) and other sensitive data, compromise Mimosa’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud EC2 instance and S3 Buckets, and execute unauthorized remote code on all cloud-connected Mimosa devices.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following products of the Mimosa by Airspan product line, a network management software platform, are affected:

* MMP: All versions prior to v1.0.3
* PTP C-series: Device versions prior to v2.8.6.1
* PTMP C-series and A5x: Device versions prior to v2.5.4.1

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)

The affected product does not perform proper authorization and authentication checks on multiple API routes. An attacker may gain access to these API routes and achieve remote code execution, create a denial-of-service condition, and obtain sensitive information.

[CVE-2022-21196](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21196) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [INCORRECT AUTHORIZATION CWE-863](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/863.html)

The affected product does not perform proper authorization checks on multiple API functions. An attacker may gain access to these functions and achieve remote code execution, create a denial-of-service condition, and obtain sensitive information.

[CVE-2022-21141](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21141) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF) CWE-918](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to force the server to create and execute a web request granting access to backend APIs that are only accessible to the Mimosa MMP server, or request pages that could perform some actions themselves. The attacker could force the server into accessing routes on those cloud-hosting platforms, accessing secret keys, changing configurations, etc.

[CVE-2022-21215](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21215) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The affected product does not properly sanitize user input, which may allow an attacker to perform a SQL injection and obtain sensitive information.

[CVE-2022-21176](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21176) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.5    [DESERIALIZATION OF UNTRUSTED DATA CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)

The affected product has a deserialization function that does not validate or check the data, allowing arbitrary classes to be created.

[CVE-2022-0138](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-0138) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)).

#### 3.2.6    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN OS COMMAND ('OS COMMAND INJECTION') CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)

The affected product does not properly sanitize user input on several locations, which may allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

[CVE-2022-21143](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21143) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.7    [USE OF A BROKEN OR RISKY CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHM CWE-327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)

The affected product uses the MD5 algorithm to hash the passwords before storing them but does not salt the hash. As a result, attackers may be able to crack the hashed passwords.

[CVE-2022-21800](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21800) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Airspan Networks recommends users update to following products (Login Required):

* MMP: [Version 1.0.4 or later](https://cloud.mimosa.co/app/index.html#/updateFirmware/firmwareDownload/MMP)
* PTP:
  + C5x: [Version 2.90 or later](https://cloud.mimosa.co/app/index.html#/updateFirmware/firmwareDownload/C5x-PTP)
  + C5c: [Version 2.90 or later](https://cloud.mimosa.co/app/index.html#/updateFirmware/firmwareDownload/C5c-PTP)
* PTMP:
  + C-series: [Version 2.9.0 or later](https://cloud.mimosa.co/app/index.html#/updateFirmware/firmwareDownload/C5-C5c-C5x)
  + A5x: [Version 2.9.0 or later](https://cloud.mimosa.co/app/index.html#/updateFirmware/firmwareDownload/A5x)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
