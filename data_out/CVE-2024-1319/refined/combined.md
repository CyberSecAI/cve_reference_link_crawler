## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Event Tickets Plus < 5.9.1 - Contributor+ Attendees Lists Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users with at least the contributor role from leaking the attendees list on any post type regardless of status. (e.g. draft, private, pending review, password-protected, and trashed posts).

### Proof of Concept

1. ADMIN: Install Event Tickets
2. ADMIN: Install Event Tickets Plus
3. ADMIN: Create pages with each status: published, private, password-protected, draft, and trashed and add one RSVP that has an end sale date of 1 week from now
4. ADMIN: Go to those pages and RSVP for each one as the currently logged in admin (the trashed post will need to be trashed after you add the RSVP)
5. CONTRIBUTOR: Add shortcode to any post and specify/guess the page ID and save
6. CONTRIBUTOR: Preview the post and see all attendees for pages (of any status) you shouldn't have access to (NOTE: Attendee list shortcode will only output on the first occurrence so you may need to modify the page ID you reference for each of your tests)
Example shortcode: `[tribe\_attendees\_list event="ANY\_PAGE\_ID"]`
