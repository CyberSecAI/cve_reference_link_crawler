Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Event Tickets Plus plugin fails to properly restrict access to attendee lists, allowing users with at least the "contributor" role to view lists associated with any post type, regardless of its status (e.g., draft, private, password-protected, trashed).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin does not enforce proper access controls, leading to unauthorized information disclosure. Specifically, it fails to check user permissions before displaying the attendee list.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes sensitive information (attendee lists) to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Attendee Information:**  Contributors can view attendee lists for events they should not have access to, including private, draft, password-protected, or trashed events.
*   **Privacy Violation:** This could potentially expose private information of event attendees to unauthorized users, which may cause reputational damage to the organizers.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** A contributor user can insert the `[tribe_attendees_list event="ANY_PAGE_ID"]` shortcode into any post and preview it. By specifying or guessing page IDs, they can gain access to attendee information for the specified events.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have at least a "contributor" role within the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to know or guess a valid page ID to view attendee lists.
*   The attacker needs to be able to add shortcodes to a post.
