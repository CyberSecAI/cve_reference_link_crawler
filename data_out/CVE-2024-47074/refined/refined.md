  "related": true,
  "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of filtering of JDBC connection parameters in the Dataease PostgreSQL data source. An attacker can inject malicious parameters to trigger the PostgreSQL JDBC deserialization vulnerability, leading to remote code execution.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The `PgConfiguration` class in `JdbcProvider.java` does not properly sanitize or filter user-provided JDBC connection parameters. Specifically, the `extraParams` field is directly concatenated into the JDBC URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Unsafe deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious parameters into the JDBC URL, which when processed by the PostgreSQL JDBC driver on the server, can lead to arbitrary code execution due to a deserialization vulnerability in the driver. This can result in complete server compromise.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious JDBC connection URL with specific parameters that exploit the deserialization vulnerability in the PG driver.",
      "The attacker must be able to configure a PostgreSQL data source in Dataease to inject the malicious JDBC parameters."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to configure a PostgreSQL data source within the Dataease application, allowing them to provide custom JDBC connection parameters. The attacker also needs to be aware of and be able to exploit the PostgreSQL JDBC deserialization vulnerability by providing malicious parameters.",
    "additional_information": "The fix involves filtering the `extraParams` parameter by checking against a list of illegal parameters. Specifically, the commit `86eafc4d77f0bbc0eaa7fc58e5076a085257f259` introduces a list of `illegalParameters` and checks if user provided extra parameters contains any of these."
