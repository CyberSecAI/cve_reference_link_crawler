Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-27034**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect locking during the process of overwriting a compressed cluster with a normal cluster in the F2FS file system. Specifically, the `cp_rwsem` lock was being released prematurely within the `f2fs_write_raw_pages()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race Condition:**  Releasing the `cp_rwsem` lock too early creates a race condition. If some blocks of the normal cluster are persisted before a checkpoint (CP) or the start of a System Power On Reset (SPOR) operation, and the cluster metadata is not updated atomically, data corruption can occur.
- **Incorrect Locking:** The code was not correctly ensuring that operations related to overwriting compressed data with normal data were atomic with respect to checkpoint and system power on reset operations, leading to a potential data inconsistency.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** The primary impact is data corruption. When a compressed cluster is overwritten with a normal cluster, the incorrect locking can result in inconsistent or partial data writes, leading to file system corruption and potential data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- This vulnerability is triggered during normal file system operations, when writing to a compressed cluster in F2FS such that it overwrites compressed data with normal (uncompressed) data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write data to an F2FS file system where data compression is enabled and then cause a system checkpoint or power reset operation. There are no special capabilities needed other than typical user level access for normal write operations in a filesystem.
