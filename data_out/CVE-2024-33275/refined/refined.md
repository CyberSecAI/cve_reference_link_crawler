Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `product_search.php` script within the "Super Newsletter" module contains SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of input parameters (`id_shop`, `id_lang`) before they are used in SQL queries. Specifically, the code uses `pSQL()` which is not enough to protect from SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The module fails to properly sanitize input parameters before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code. This can be exploited through a simple HTTP call with a predictable token.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data from the database, including tokens and admin script URLs.
*   **High Integrity Impact:** Attackers can modify data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation. This could involve adding/modifying/deleting data in the database.
*   **High Availability Impact:** The vulnerability could potentially be used to disrupt the availability of the application by making it unstable, crash or simply corrupt data.
*   **Complete system takeover** An attacker can achieve the goal of obtaining admin access, rewriting SMTP settings to hijack emails, and other malicious uses.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through HTTP requests.
*   **Simple HTTP Call**: It can be exploited with a trivial HTTP call and predictable tokens.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not require any interaction from a user to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Guest access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a guest user, no authentication is required.

**Additional details:**

*   The module is obsolete and the author has discontinued support, thus no official patch is available.
*   The provided patch replaces the use of `pSQL` with `(int)` casting to sanitize the vulnerable parameters.
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the module up to and including 1.4.21.
*   The module is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `product_search.php` file.
*   Attackers can obtain admin access, remove data, expose tokens, and hijack emails, among other malicious activities.
* The advisory recommends deleting the module and restricting access to the `/modules/supernewsletter/ajax/` directory as a workaround to the lack of official patch.
