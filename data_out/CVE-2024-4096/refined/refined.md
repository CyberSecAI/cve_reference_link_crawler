- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within its Tab settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize and escape the "title" field when creating a new tab in "Tab Sets".
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the tab title, which will then be executed when a user views the tab, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by users with contributor-level privileges or higher. They can insert the malicious code through the tab title field within the plugin's "Tab Sets" section. The payload is stored in the database, and is triggered when another user views the page where the tab is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress admin panel. They need to be able to access the "Tab Sets" section of the plugin, and be able to create and save tab sets.
