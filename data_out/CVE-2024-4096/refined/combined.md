# Responsive Tabs < 4.0.11 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Tab settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Contributors and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Tab Sets > Add New"
2. For the tab details title, add the payload: `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&gt;`
3. Save and see the XSS
4. When the admin goes to approve the tab, the XSS will triggered
