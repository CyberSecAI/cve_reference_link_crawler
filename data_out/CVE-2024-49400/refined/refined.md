- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper regex matching on authorized commands and arguments. The intended full string match was not enforced, allowing substring matches instead.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation, specifically regarding regex matching, leading to potential command injection or unauthorized command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized commands could be executed on the system due to the incorrect regex matching.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation would involve providing commands that contain a substring matching an authorized command, but with additional unauthorized content before or after it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the vulnerable Tacquito system, likely through a channel that would allow command execution.
