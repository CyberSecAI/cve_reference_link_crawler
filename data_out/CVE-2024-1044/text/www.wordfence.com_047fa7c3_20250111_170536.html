### Description

The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'submit\_review' function in all versions up to, and including, 5.38.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit reviews with arbitrary email addresses regardless of whether reviews are globally enabled.
