Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permissions checks in `LocationManagerService`. Specifically, applications were able to read location requests of other users without having the necessary `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is an insufficient access control mechanism that allows an app to access location data belonging to different users on the same device, which should not have been possible without the appropriate permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A malicious application could potentially read the location requests of other users on the device. This unauthorized access to location data could lead to a privacy breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

A malicious app installed on the device could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs to have an application installed on the device. The attacker's application doesn't need elevated privileges, but it must be able to interact with the `LocationManagerService`. The attacker must be able to run code on the target device.

**Additional Information:**

The provided commit message indicates that the fix adds a permissions check to `LocationManagerService`, explicitly requiring `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission for accessing location requests of other users.
