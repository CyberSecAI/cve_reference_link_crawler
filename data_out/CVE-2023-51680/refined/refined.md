- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions they should not have access to.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (Subscriber) can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact will vary on a case by case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not specified, however, it is implied to be related to the WordPress plugin itself.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site.
