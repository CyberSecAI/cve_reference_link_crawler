In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: mdio: fix memory leak

Syzbot reported memory leak in MDIO bus interface, the problem was in
wrong state logic.

MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED indicates 2 states:
	1. Bus is only allocated
	2. Bus allocated and __mdiobus_register() fails, but
	   device_register() was called

In case of device_register() has been called we should call put_device()
to correctly free the memory allocated for this device, but mdiobus_free()
calls just kfree(dev) in case of MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED state

To avoid this behaviour we need to set bus->state to MDIOBUS_UNREGISTERED
_before_ calling device_register(), because put_device() should be
called even in case of device_register() failure.
