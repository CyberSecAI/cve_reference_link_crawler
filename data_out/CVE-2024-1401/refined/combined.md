## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Profile Box Shortcode And Widget < 1.2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

When creating a new widget, insert the following payload in the "Max width" field: `250" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"`
View the site on the frontend to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
