- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unsafe search path vulnerability exists in FortiClient and FortiClient EMS. The application searches for DLL files in an insecure manner, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue caused by an unsafe search path. When FortiClient or FortiClient EMS attempts to load an OpenSSL engine library, it searches in locations where a malicious user can place a specially crafted DLL with the same name.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful DLL hijack attack allows an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands with the privileges of the affected application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves placing a malicious OpenSSL engine library with the same name in the application's search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to write files to a directory within the DLL search path used by the application. A low privileged user is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
