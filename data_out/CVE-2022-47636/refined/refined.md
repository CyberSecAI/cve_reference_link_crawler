  "CVE-2022-47636": {
    "Description": "A DLL hijacking vulnerability has been discovered in OutSystems Service Studio 11 11.53.30 build 61739. When a user opens a .oml file (OutSystems Modeling Language), the application will load the following DLLs from the same directory: av_libGLESv2.dll, libcef.DLL, user32.dll, d3d10warp.dll. Using a crafted DLL, it is possible to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current logged in user.",
    "Root cause": "The application loads specific DLLs from the same directory as the .oml file being opened.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "DLL Hijacking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current logged-in user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted .oml file containing malicious DLLs in the same directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a malicious .oml file and place malicious DLLs in the same directory as the .oml file. The attacker needs to have the target user open the malicious .oml file. The attacker needs local file system access to the system.",
