The provided content is related to CVE-2023-20147.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV series routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The web interface does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
* Access sensitive, browser-based information.

**Attack vectors:**
An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. The attacker must then persuade a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router and then trick a user of the router's web interface to visit a specific page containing the malicious payload. No authentication is required for the initial HTTP request.
