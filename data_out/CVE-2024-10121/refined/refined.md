Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass in the `wfh45678 Radar` application. Specifically, the application fails to properly restrict access to its interfaces, allowing unauthenticated users to access any interface by manipulating the URL with `/../`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the lack of proper authentication checks, which allows unauthorized access to application functionalities.
- **Path Traversal:** Although the vulnerability is described as not being a path traversal issue, the manipulation of the URL with `/../` suggests that path traversal-like techniques are being used to bypass authorization checks.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated requests to reach protected resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access could expose sensitive data managed by the Radar application.
- **Integrity:** Attackers might be able to modify data within the application, leading to incorrect risk assessment.
- **Availability:** The vulnerability could be exploited to disrupt the services, potentially rendering the risk engine unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Radar application.
- **No Special Skills:** The exploit is considered easy to execute.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding `/../` to the URL when accessing a specific endpoint, e.g., `/services/v1/model/list` becomes `/services/v1/model/list/../`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of Radar up to and including 1.0.8.

**Additional Notes:**
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available on GitHub.
- The vendor was notified but did not respond.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-639, relating to authorization bypass, as well as CWE-285 and CWE-266.
