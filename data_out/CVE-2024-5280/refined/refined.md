- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Affiliate Platform" lacks CSRF checks in some areas and is missing sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The absence of CSRF protection allows the attacker to force a victim to submit malicious requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the website. Non-logged in users can be targeted through CSRF attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form with an XSS payload embedded in the `start_date` and `end_date` POST parameters, and forces a user to submit the form via CSRF. The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking the victim into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious form. The attacker does not need to be logged in to the application. They need to social engineer the user into submitting the form.
