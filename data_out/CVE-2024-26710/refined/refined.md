The provided content relates to a fix for a potential stack overflow issue when using Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) on PowerPC architecture.

**Root Cause:**
- KASAN increases stack usage and the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in commit 3e8635fb2e07.
- When a 32KB stack is doubled, it results in a 64KB stack causing build errors due to out-of-range operands in assembly code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled stack growth due to KASAN could lead to stack overflow, particularly on 32-bit machines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow can lead to various issues, including:
    - System crashes
    - Arbitrary code execution (potentially)
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- This is not an externally exploitable vulnerability. The issue arises from the interaction between KASAN and stack size configurations during kernel builds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- This is not a traditional vulnerability requiring attacker capabilities. The issue is present during the build process when KASAN is enabled on the PowerPC architecture. The "attacker" would be the build process itself and its failure when certain configurations are present.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix limits the stack size increase for KASAN to 32KB only if the current stack size is less than 32KB. This prevents the doubling to 64KB when a 32KB stack is already present, avoiding the build errors.
- The commit message states that a 32KB stack seems sufficient even for KASAN builds, with the additional usage in the 2-3KB range for 64-bit KASAN.
- The fix is related to commit 18f14afe2816 ("powerpc/64s: Increase default stack size to 32KB").
