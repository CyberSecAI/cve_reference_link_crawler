This document contains vulnerability information for CVE-2021-44380.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SetTime` API's JSON parameter parser assumes that the "param" JSON element is an object, but this is not validated. When a string value is provided instead of an object, the program attempts to access it as an object which leads to an assertion failure in the `Json::Value::operator[]` function, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to terminate and the device to reboot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The API's JSON parameter parser does not validate the type of the "param" JSON element, assuming it will always be an object.
- Denial of Service: By sending a malformed JSON request with the "param" element as a string instead of an object, an attacker can trigger a crash and reboot of the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The device reboots, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the device's API endpoint (`/cgi-bin/api.cgi`) with a malformed JSON body using the `SetTime` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. While most commands require a logged-in user, it's mentioned that TALOS-2021-1420 can be used to bypass authentication.
- Knowledge of the API endpoint and JSON structure used by the device.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `cgiserver.cgi` process, which manages API requests.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the lack of type checking on the "param" JSON element in the `SetTime` command's specific parameter parser.
- The provided code snippets highlight the vulnerable `Json::Value::operator[]` function and how it causes a crash when it receives a non-object value.
- The document describes 65 similar vulnerabilities, all related to the same root cause, affecting different APIs on the Reolink RLC-410W device.
