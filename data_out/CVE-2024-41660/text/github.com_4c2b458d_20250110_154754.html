# Unauthenticated memory corruption via slpd-lite server

Critical

[geissonator](/geissonator)
published
GHSA-wmgv-jffg-v3xr
Jul 31, 2024

## Package

slpd-lite
(OpenBMC)

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Any OpenBMC system that includes the slpd-lite package is impacted. Installing this package is the default when building OpenBMC. Nefarious users can send slp packets to the BMC using UDP port 427 to cause memory overflow issues within the slpd-lite daemon on the BMC.

### Patches

Patches are available in the openbmc/slpd-lite repository. The fix is a series of 7 [commits](https://github.com/openbmc/slpd-lite/commits/master/) ending in [20bab74](https://github.com/openbmc/slpd-lite/commit/20bab74865ba955921eb0e4e427c84e37e1c8916).

### Workarounds

Block UDP port 427 on your network to prevent users from accessing the BMC. If ssh access to the BMC is available, the slpd-lite.service can be disabled via systemctl.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
