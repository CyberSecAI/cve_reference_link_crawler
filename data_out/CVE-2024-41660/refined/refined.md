- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory overflow issues within the slpd-lite daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Nefarious users can cause memory overflow issues within the slpd-lite daemon on the BMC. This can lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues, as indicated by the CVSS metrics (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors:** Network. An attacker can send specifically crafted SLP packets to the BMC using UDP port 427.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the BMC on port 427. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
