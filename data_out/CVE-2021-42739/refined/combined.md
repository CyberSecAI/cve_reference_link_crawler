Subject: [[PATCH] media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc_ca_pmt()](#r)
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 2021 11:57:59 +0300	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <YHaulytonFcW+lyZ@mwanda> (<raw>)
In-Reply-To: <[000001d73031$d5304480$7f90cd80$@nsfocus.com](../000001d73031%24d5304480%247f90cd80%24%40nsfocus.com/)>

The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should
be checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes.  If the
"es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
be an additional check for that.

I also added checks for the "write_pos".  I don't think these are
required because "read_pos" and "write_pos" are tied together so
checking one ought to be enough.  But they make the code easier to
understand for me.

The other problem is that "length" can be invalid.  It comes from
"data_length" in fdtv_ca_pmt().

This hardware isn't super common so there is no embargo.  Resending
through normal lists.

Oh, another thing is the data_length calculation in fdtv_ca_pmt() seems
very suspicous.  Reading more than 4 bytes in the loop will lead to
shift wrapping.

media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc\_ca\_pmt()The bounds checking in avc\_ca\_pmt() is not strict enough. It should
be checking "read\_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes. If the
"es\_info\_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
be an additional check for that.
I also added checks for the "write\_pos". I don't think these are
required because "read\_pos" and "write\_pos" are tied together so
checking one ought to be enough. But they make the code easier to
understand for me. The check on write\_pos is:
if (write\_pos + 4 >= sizeof(c->operand) - 4) {
The first "+ 4" is because we're writing 5 bytes and the last " - 4"
is to leave space for the CRC.
The other problem is that "length" can be invalid. It comes from
"data\_length" in fdtv\_ca\_pmt().

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

# Linux kernel: a heap buffer overflow in firedtv driver

---

*From*: "Luo Likang" <luolikang () nsfocus com>

*Date*: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 09:58:05 +0800

---

```
I found a buffer overflow vulnerability in function
avc_ca_pmt(drivers/media/fireware/firedtv-avc.c).

The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should be
checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes. If the
"es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to be
an additional check for that.

a)      static int fdtv_ca_pmt(struct firedtv *fdtv, void *arg)

{

       struct ca_msg *msg = arg;

       int data_pos;

       int data_length;

       int i;

       data_pos = 4;

       if (msg->msg[3] & 0x80) {

              data_length = 0;

              for (i = 0; i < (msg->msg[3] & 0x7f); i++)

                     data_length = (data_length << 8) +
msg->msg[data_pos++];

       } else {

              data_length = msg->msg[3];

       }

       return avc_ca_pmt(fdtv, &msg->msg[data_pos], data_length); <== setp
in

}

In this function, the content of `arg` is still the original data passed in
by the user. If msg->msg[3] = 0x84, msg->[4] = 0xff, msg->msg[5]=0xff,
msg->msg[6]=0xff, msg->msg[7]=0xff , will enter the for loop four times, and
data_length will be equal to 0xffffffff, and then call avc_ca_pmt(fdtv,
&msg->msg[8], 0xffffffff)

b)      int avc_ca_pmt(struct firedtv *fdtv, char *msg, int length)

{

       ..

       int program_info_length;

       int pmt_cmd_id;

       int read_pos;

       int write_pos;

       int es_info_length;

       int crc32_csum;

       int ret;

       ..

       program_info_length = ((msg[4] & 0x0f) << 8) + msg[5]; /////////////
[0]

       if (program_info_length > 0)

              program_info_length--; /* Remove pmt_cmd_id */

       pmt_cmd_id = msg[6];                             //////////////[1]

       c->operand[0] = SFE_VENDOR_DE_COMPANYID_0;

       ..

       c->operand[23] = (program_info_length & 0xff);

       /* CA descriptors at programme level */

       read_pos = 6;

       write_pos = 24;

       if (program_info_length > 0) {

              pmt_cmd_id = msg[read_pos++];

              if (pmt_cmd_id != 1 && pmt_cmd_id != 4)
////////////[2]

                     dev_err(fdtv->device,

                            "invalid pmt_cmd_id %d\n", pmt_cmd_id);

              if (program_info_length > sizeof(c->operand) - 4 - write_pos)
{  ///[3]

                     ret = -EINVAL;

                     goto out;

              }

              memcpy(&c->operand[write_pos], &msg[read_pos],

                     program_info_length);

              read_pos += program_info_length;

              write_pos += program_info_length;             //////[4]

       }

# Linux kernel: a heap buffer overflow in firedtv driver

---

*From*: "Luo Likang" <luolikang () nsfocus com>

*Date*: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 09:58:05 +0800

```
I found a buffer overflow vulnerability in function
avc_ca_pmt(drivers/media/fireware/firedtv-avc.c).

The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should be
checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes. If the
"es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to be
an additional check for that.

a)      static int fdtv_ca_pmt(struct firedtv *fdtv, void *arg)

{

       struct ca_msg *msg = arg;

       int data_pos;

       int data_length;

       int i;

       data_pos = 4;

       if (msg->msg[3] & 0x80) {

              data_length = 0;

              for (i = 0; i < (msg->msg[3] & 0x7f); i++)

                     data_length = (data_length << 8) +
msg->msg[data_pos++];

       } else {

              data_length = msg->msg[3];

       }

       return avc_ca_pmt(fdtv, &msg->msg[data_pos], data_length); <== setp
in

}

In this function, the content of `arg` is still the original data passed in
by the user. If msg->msg[3] = 0x84, msg->[4] = 0xff, msg->msg[5]=0xff,
msg->msg[6]=0xff, msg->msg[7]=0xff , will enter the for loop four times, and
data_length will be equal to 0xffffffff, and then call avc_ca_pmt(fdtv,
&msg->msg[8], 0xffffffff)

b)      int avc_ca_pmt(struct firedtv *fdtv, char *msg, int length)

{

       ..

       int program_info_length;

       int pmt_cmd_id;

       int read_pos;

       int write_pos;

       int es_info_length;

       int crc32_csum;

       int ret;

       ..

       program_info_length = ((msg[4] & 0x0f) << 8) + msg[5]; /////////////
[0]

       if (program_info_length > 0)

              program_info_length--; /* Remove pmt_cmd_id */

       pmt_cmd_id = msg[6];                             //////////////[1]

       c->operand[0] = SFE_VENDOR_DE_COMPANYID_0;

       ..

       c->operand[23] = (program_info_length & 0xff);

       /* CA descriptors at programme level */

       read_pos = 6;

       write_pos = 24;

       if (program_info_length > 0) {

              pmt_cmd_id = msg[read_pos++];

              if (pmt_cmd_id != 1 && pmt_cmd_id != 4)
////////////[2]

                     dev_err(fdtv->device,

                            "invalid pmt_cmd_id %d\n", pmt_cmd_id);

              if (program_info_length > sizeof(c->operand) - 4 - write_pos)
{  ///[3]

                     ret = -EINVAL;

                     goto out;

              }

              memcpy(&c->operand[write_pos], &msg[read_pos],

                     program_info_length);

              read_pos += program_info_length;

              write_pos += program_info_length;             //////[4]

       }

       while (read_pos < length) {                      ////////[5]

              c->operand[write_pos++] = msg[read_pos++]; ///[6]

              c->operand[write_pos++] = msg[read_pos++];

              c->operand[write_pos++] = msg[read_pos++];

..

              }

       }

In [0] and [1] : We can full control the program_info_length and pmt_cmd_id
;

In [2] : for bypass it, pmt_cmd_id must be 1 or 4 ;

In [3] : program_info_length > sizeof(c->operand) - 4 - write_pos)

==> program_info_length <= 509 - 4 - 24 = 0x1e1, so you can control its
value to be 0x1e1 .

           In [4] : write_pos will be updated to 24+0x1e1 = 505

           In [5]: at this time, length=0xffffffff, read_pos is much smaller
than it, so in[6] will overwrite the c->oprand many bytes.

## Environment

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux

## Issue

* How do I prevent a kernel module from loading automatically?
* How to disable a kernel module?
* How to disable a specific device driver?

## Resolution

* In order to prevent kernel modules loading during boot, the module name must be added to a configuration file for the "modprobe" utility. This file must reside in `/etc/modprobe.d` .
* Ensure the module is not configured to get loaded in either `/etc/modprobe.conf`, `/etc/modprobe.d/*`, `/etc/rc.modules`, or `/etc/sysconfig/modules/*` before making the following modifications.
* Due to differences between the various versions of RHEL, be sure to follow the appropriate steps for your system's version below:
  + The shared steps for [RHEL 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9](#sharedrhel5678and9) followed by the specific steps for each version
  + The steps for [RHEL 4](#rhel4)
* [Unloading kernel modules at the early stages of the boot](#EarlyBootStageModuleUnloading)

### Shared Initial Steps for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

Kernel modules can be loaded directly, loaded as a dependency from another module, or during the boot process -- because of this, we need to take several measures to keep the module from being loaded.

* **[ step1 ]** First we unload the module from the running system if it is loaded.

  ```
  # modprobe -r module_name                                                      #step1

  ```
* **[ step2 ]** To prevent a module from being loaded directly you add the `blacklist` line to a configuration file specific to the system configuration -- for example `/etc/modprobe.d/local-dontload.conf`.

  *This alone will not prevent a module being loaded if it is a required or an optional dependency of another module. Some kernel modules will attempt to load optional modules on demand, which we mitigate in the step3.*

  ```
  # echo "blacklist module_name" >> /etc/modprobe.d/local-dontload.conf            #step2

  ```
* **[ step3 ]** The `install` line simply causes `/bin/false` to be run instead of installing a module. (The same can be achieved by using `/bin/true`.)

  The next time the loading of the module is attempted, the `/bin/false` will be executed instead. This will prevent the module from being loaded on-demand. If the excluded module is required for other specific hardware, there might be unexpected side effects.

  ```
  # echo "install module_name /bin/false" >> /etc/modprobe.d/local-dontload.conf   #step3

  ```
* **Now continue with the relevant steps for your system's version of RHEL:**

### Finishing Steps for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 only.

* **[ step4 ]** Make a backup copy of your initramfs.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step5 ]** If the kernel module is part of the initramfs (use `lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img|grep module-name.ko` to verify), then you should rebuild your initial ramdisk image, omitting the module to be avoided (see [How to rebuild the initial ramdisk image in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1958) for more information).

  ```
  # dracut --omit-drivers module_name -f

  ```

  **Optional**: To make this persistent across future kernel upgrades and initramfs rebuilds, add the driver to omit to dracut's permanent configuration:

  ```
  # MODNAME="module_name"; echo "omit_dracutmodules+=\" $MODNAME \"" >> /etc/dracut.conf.d/omit-$MODNAME.conf

  ```

  To remove the persistent configuration, delete the `/etc/dracut.conf.d/omit-module_name.conf` file and rebuild the initramfs.
* **[ step6 ]** Get the current kernel command line parameters.

  ```
  # grubby --info DEFAULT
  # grubby --info ALL (To view changes in all available kernels)

  ```
* **[ step7 ]** Append `module_name.blacklist=1 rd.driver.blacklist=module_name` at the end of the output found in #step 6. (For RHEL 8 and RHEL 9, `grubby` utility is actually the recommended method for altering these variables. Refer [How to manually modify the boot parameter in grub before the system boots](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6668601) for more information).

  ```
  # grubby --args  "<module_name.blacklist=1 rd.driver.blacklist=module_name>" --update-kernel ALL
  # grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="<PARAMETER_TO_REMOVE>" (incase if we wish to remove the added parameters later)

  ```
* **[ step8 ]** Make a backup copy of the kdump initramfs.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step9 ]** Append `rd.driver.blacklist=module_name` to the `KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND` setting in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`. This will cause it to be omitted from the kdump initramfs.

  ```
  # sed -i '/^KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND=/s/"$/ rd.driver.blacklist=module_name"/' /etc/sysconfig/kdump

  ```
* **[ step10 ]** Restart the kdump service to pick up the changes to kdump's initrd.

  ```
  # kdumpctl restart

  ```
* **[ step11 ]** Rebuild the kdump initial ramdisk image.

  ```
  # mkdumprd -f /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img

  ```
* **[ step12 ]** Reboot the system for changes to reflect.

  ```
  # reboot

  ```

---

### Finishing Steps for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 only

* **[ step4 ]** Make a backup copy of your initramfs.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step5 ]** If the kernel module is part of the initramfs (boot configuration), rebuild your initial ramdisk image, omitting the module to be avoided (see [How to rebuild the initial ramdisk image in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1958) for more information).

  ```
  # dracut --omit-drivers module_name -f

  ```

  **Optional**: To make this persistent across future kernel upgrades and initramfs rebuilds, add the driver to omit to dracut's permanent configuration:

  ```
  # MODNAME="module_name"; echo "omit_dracutmodules+=\" $MODNAME \"" >> /etc/dracut.conf.d/omit-$MODNAME.conf

  ```

  To remove the persistent configuration, delete the `/etc/dracut.conf.d/omit-module_name.conf` file and rebuild the initramfs.
* **[ step6 ]** Append *module\_name*.blacklist to the kernel `cmdline`. We give it an invalid parameter of `blacklist` and set it to `1` as a way to preclude the kernel from loading it. Here we also set `rd.driver.blacklist` as another method of preventing it from being loaded.

  ```
  # sed -i '/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=/s/"$/ module_name.blacklist=1 rd.driver.blacklist=module_name"/' /etc/default/grub

  ```
* **[ step7 ]** Reinstall grub2 to put the kernel `cmdline` changes into effect. **If your system uses UEFI, the path must be changed to /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg**

  ```
  # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

  ```
* **[ step8 ]** Make a backup copy of the kdump initramfs.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step9 ]** Append `rd.driver.blacklist=module_name` to the `KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND` setting in `/etc/sysconfig/kdump`. This will cause it to be omitted from the kdump initramfs.

  ```
  # sed -i '/^KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND=/s/"$/ rd.driver.blacklist=module_name"/' /etc/sysconfig/kdump

  ```
* **[ step10 ]** Restart the kdump service to pick up the changes to kdump's initrd.

  ```
  # kdumpctl restart

  ```
* **[ step11 ]** Rebuild the kdump initial ramdisk image.

  ```
  # mkdumprd -f /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r)kdump.img

  ```
* **[ step12 ]** Reboot the system at a convenient time to have the changes take effect.

  ```
  # reboot

  ```

---

### Finishing Steps for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 only

* **[ step4 ]** Make a backup copy of your initramfs.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step5 ]** If the kernel module is part of the initramfs (boot configuration), rebuild your initial ramdisk image, omitting the module to be avoided (see [How to rebuild the initial ramdisk image in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1958) for more information).

  ```
  # dracut --omit-drivers module_name -f

  ```

  **Optional**: To make this persistent across future kernel upgrades and initramfs rebuilds, add the driver to omit to dracut's permanent configuration:

  ```
  # MODNAME="module_name"; echo "omit_dracutmodules+=\"$MODNAME\"" >> /etc/dracut.conf

  ```

  To remove the persistent configuration, delete the `omit_dracutmodules` line from `/etc/dracut.conf` and rebuild the initramfs.
* **[ step6 ]** Append *module\_name*.blacklist to the kernel `cmdline`. We give it an invalid parameter of `blacklist` and set it to `1` as a way to preclude the kernel from loading it.

  ```
  # sed -i '/\s*kernel \/vmlinuz/s/$/ module_name.blacklist=1/' /boot/grub/grub.conf

  ```
* **[ step7 ]** Edit kdump's configuration file: mark it there as excluded from being loaded by kdump.

  ```
  # echo "blacklist module_name" >> /etc/kdump.conf

  ```
* **[ step8 ]** Restart the kdump service to pick up the changes to kdump's initrd.

  ```
  # service kdump restart

  ```
* **[ step9 ]** Reboot the system at a convenient time to have the changes take effect.

  ```
  # reboot

  ```

---

### Continued Steps for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 only

* **[ step4 ]** Make a backup copy of your initrd.

  ```
  # cp /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img.$(date +%m-%d-%H%M%S).bak

  ```
* **[ step5 ]** If the kernel module is part of the initrd (boot configuration), rebuild your initial ramdisk image. Use the `--builtin=module_name` flag to `mkinitrd` to have it skip the module in question.

  ```
  # mkinitrd -v --builtin=module_name

  ```
* **[ step6 ]** Append *module\_name*.blacklist to the kernel `cmdline`. We give it an invalid parameter of `blacklist` and set it to `1` as a way to preclude the kernel from loading it.

  ```
  # sed -i '/\s*kernel \/vmlinuz/s/$/ module_name.blacklist=1/' /boot/grub/grub.conf

  ```
* **[ step7 ]** Reboot the system at a convenient time to have the changes take effect.

  ```
  # reboot

  ```

Kernel modules can be loaded directly, loaded as a dependency from another module, or during the boot process -- because of this, we need to take several measures to keep the module from being loaded.

---

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4

* Add the following line to `/etc/modprobe.conf`:

  ```
  alias <module name> off

  ```
* If the kernel module is part of the initrd (boot configuration), the initrd should be regenerated. Boot the affected kernel and run the following command to regenerate the affected kernel initrd.

  ```
  # mkinitrd /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)

  ```

### Remove Module Temporarily

* It is possible to remove any currently-loaded module by running:

  ```
  # modprobe -r <module name>

  ```

Various reasons can prevent unloading of the module.

* If a running process uses the module, then terminate the process before unloading the module.
* If a second module uses the module we try to unload, then the second module needs to be unloaded first.

### Loading Modules

The procedure for loading modules is available in the product documentation at:

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Managing, monitoring and updating the kernel: Chapter 3. Managing kernel modules](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_monitoring_and_updating_the_kernel/managing-kernel-modules_managing-monitoring-and-updating-the-kernel#preventing-kernel-modules-from-being-automatically-loaded-at-system-boot-time_managing-kernel-modules)

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Deployment Guide : Persistent Module Loading](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-kernel-modules-persistant.html)
* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Reference Guide : Persistent Module Loading](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Reference_Guide/s1-kernel-modules-persistant.html)

### Unloading kernel modules at the early stages of the boot

If the server is getting crashed/panicked on boot due to 3rd party module then it can be unloaded in the early stage of the boot process using the below steps:

**[ step1 ]** Reboot the server and wait until the GRUB menu appears, now press any key to interrupt the default timeout value. Select the kernel to boot into using the up/down key and once selected, press the `e` key.

**[ step2 ]** Scroll to the line starting with:

- `linux16` or `linuxefi` (on UEFI systems) if RHEL 7

- `linux` if RHEL 8 or RHEL 9

**[ step3 ]** Append the following to that line:

```
module_blacklist=<module_name>

```

* Where the `<module_name>` is the name of the module that is causing the issue here. For example, if “abc” module is causing the issue then the parameter will be:

```
module_blacklist=abc

```

* Multiple modules can be specified as a comma-separated list.

**[ step4 ]** Press CTRL+x to accept the changes and to boot the system with the temporary kernel parameter changes.

**[ step5 ]** Once the system gets booted successfully disable the module permanently using the above mentioned steps for the respective RHEL version and engage the respective module vendor for further investigation.

* Note: The kernel parameter `module_blacklist` is only available from RHEL 7.3 and above.
