| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1951739#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-04-20 20:07:00 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel FireDTV media card driver, where the user calls the CA_SEND_MSG ioctl. This flaw allows a local user of the host machine to crash the system or escalate privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.
