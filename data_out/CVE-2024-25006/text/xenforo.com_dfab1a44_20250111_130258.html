Hi,

I just discovered a Zip Slip Vulnerability affecting the Styles Import feature:

1. Login into the admin panel
2. Go to Appearance -> Styles
3. Click on "Import" and upload the attached zip file
4. Notice how the malicious PHP file will be written outside of the temp directory, reachable at http://[xenforo]/internal\_data/temp/sh.php

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permissions to administer styles.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Egidio Romano

Hi, any update on this one? Did you manage to reproduce the vulnerability?

Hi, just would like you to know I usually give a deadline disclosure to software vendors, and I'd say in this case 60 days are more than enough to fix this vulnerability. That means I will publish details about this vulnerability on March 2, 2024. Hope you will release a fixed version before that date.

Hi Egidio,

I was able to confirm that style and add-on archives containing relative paths were able to escape their container directory and bypass subsequent validation checks. Fortunately, the scope is fairly limited since exploiting this requires an administrator to upload a malicious archive. In future releases, we will skip over any files containing relative paths to mitigate this.

Thank you for the report.

Hi,

Are you planning to fix this issue in the next XenForo release? And if so, what is the ETA for it?

Hi Egidio,

A fix has been implemented and will be available in the next release (2.2.14). We do not have a concrete release date set, but I expect it will be published in early February.

Thanks again for bringing this to our attention and do let us know if you have further questions or concerns.

Hi there, just noticed today you've released version 2.2.14... However, I don't see any reference/note about the fix for this vulnerability, does that mean the vulnerability is not fixed yet?

Hi Egidio,

My apologies for the oversight. Our release notes are automatically generated, and I did not flag this for manual inclusion before they were published. I have added a note and attribution to the announcement.
