# XenForo 2.2.14 Released

* [Replies: 2](/community/threads/xenforo-2-2-14-released.219044/#posts)

XenForo 2.2.14 is now available for all licensed customers to download. We strongly recommend that all customers running previous versions of XenForo 2.2 upgrade to this release to benefit from increased stability.

In addition to the usual slew of bug fixes and improvements, there are a few notable changes in this release.

### Compatibility with PHP 8.1 and 8.2​

Most compatibility issues between PHP 8.1 and 8.2 have been addressed. Remaining issues might trigger `E_DEPRECATED` warnings in the `xf_error_log` during debug mode, but these are generally non-critical and can be disregarded.

### Email unsubscribe changes​

Previously, we allowed users to unsubscribe from emails through certain mail clients when the automated unsubscribe handler was configured. With the introduction of XenForo 2.2.14, we're implementing a new standard feature that processes unsubscribe requests via HTTP. This feature is activated by default and requires no additional configuration. Your current settings for email unsubscribing will not be altered. The recent updates include:

* Enhanced handling of the `List-Unsubscribe` header to support both `mailto` and HTTP methods.
* Automatic inclusion of the unsubscribe header in a broader range of outgoing emails, such as notifications for watched threads and activity summaries.
* A default-enabled option to send confirmation emails to users once their unsubscribe request is fulfilled.

### Minor security fix​

In previous versions, add-on or style archives could escape their container directory and bypass subsequent validation checks. Exploiting this requires an administrator with the pertinent permissions to upload a maliciously-crafted archive. This has been addressed in XenForo 2.2.14. Thank you to Egidio Romano of [Karma(In)Security](https://karmainsecurity.com/) for reporting this issue.

### Update on XenForo 2.3 and XenForo 3.0​

Work continues towards the next versions of XenForo. [@Kier](https://xenforo.com/community/members/2/) is now working full time on some exciting stuff for XenForo 3.0 while the rest of us are working towards getting XenForo 2.3 stable enough for a public beta release, in addition to the last few bells and whistles for both the core software and some enhancements to our official add-ons. Additionally, we plan to release one last update for XenForo 2.2, namely XenForo 2.2.15, which will incorporate significant fixes before we transition to primarily supporting XenForo 2.3.

## [One-click upgrade to XenForo 2.2.14](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help)​

## XenForo 2.2.14 Patch 2 Released​

Sincere apologies. A further issue has been identified in which initial upgrades to 2.2.14 may have set the default 'http' option for the unsubscribe option incorrectly.

The latest patch will workaround this issue if you are affected.

Alternatively, going to Options > Email options in your admin control panel and setting the "Unsubscribe email handling" option as desired will fix the issue without needing to upgrade.

This is being rolled out to existing Cloud customers automatically if affected.
