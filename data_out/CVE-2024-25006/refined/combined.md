Hi,

I just discovered a Zip Slip Vulnerability affecting the Styles Import feature:

1. Login into the admin panel
2. Go to Appearance -> Styles
3. Click on "Import" and upload the attached zip file
4. Notice how the malicious PHP file will be written outside of the temp directory, reachable at http://[xenforo]/internal\_data/temp/sh.php

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permissions to administer styles.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Egidio Romano

Hi, any update on this one? Did you manage to reproduce the vulnerability?

#### Egidio Romano

Jan 18, 2024

Hi, just would like you to know I usually give a deadline disclosure to software vendors, and I'd say in this case 60 days are more than enough to fix this vulnerability. That means I will publish details about this vulnerability on March 2, 2024. Hope you will release a fixed version before that date.

Hi Egidio,

I was able to confirm that style and add-on archives containing relative paths were able to escape their container directory and bypass subsequent validation checks. Fortunately, the scope is fairly limited since exploiting this requires an administrator to upload a malicious archive. In future releases, we will skip over any files containing relative paths to mitigate this.

Thank you for the report.

Hi,

Are you planning to fix this issue in the next XenForo release? And if so, what is the ETA for it?

J

#### Jeremy

Jan 24, 2024

Hi Egidio,

A fix has been implemented and will be available in the next release (2.2.14). We do not have a concrete release date set, but I expect it will be published in early February.

Thanks again for bringing this to our attention and do let us know if you have further questions or concerns.

Hi there, just noticed today you've released version 2.2.14... However, I don't see any reference/note about the fix for this vulnerability, does that mean the vulnerability is not fixed yet?

Hi Egidio,

My apologies for the oversight. Our release notes are automatically generated, and I did not flag this for manual inclusion before they were published. I have added a note and attribution to the announcement.

# Permissions

## How permissions are applied[#](#how-permissions-are-applied "Permanent link")

There are multiple permission sets that come together to define a user's final set of permissions. Under the **Groups & permissions** section, these include:

* **User group permissions**: the permissions defined for each user group you have created
* **User permissions**: an optional set of additional permissions to apply to specific users. This is used for things like moderator permissions. However, if you are ever going to apply the same permissions to multiple users, we recommend creating user groups.
* **Node permissions**: these are override permissions for specific nodes. This will be discussed more in the next section.

Add-ons may define additional permission types. These will behave similarly to node permissions.

To determine the global permissions for a user, we collect the permissions from all the groups they're a member of and any custom user permissions. The final value for a permission is then determined by which value has the highest priority.

### Permission value priority[#](#permission-value-priority "Permanent link")

As a user may be in many groups and have their own custom permissions, determining the final permission value is done by determining which value has the highest priority. The priority is defined as: (highest priority first)

1. **Never**: this is an overriding no and the permission is not granted. It always trumps other values and should only be used in specific scenarios.
2. **Yes**: the permission is granted.
3. **No**: the permission is not granted.

To make this clearer, here are some examples of what permission would "win" in various scenarios:

* **No** + **Yes** = **Yes**
* **No** + **Never** = **Never**
* **Yes** + **Never** = **Never**

For numeric permissions, the highest value from all of the groups and user permissions is used.

Warning

"Never" is a powerful feature but it can cause problems if used inappropriately. It is designed for being applied to groups that are used for user discipline, such as by removing permissions to users that have a certain number of warning points. Do not use it for the default registered group!

## Node permissions[#](#node-permissions "Permanent link")

Node permissions allow you to define permissions that will only apply to a specific node. Like the global permissions, these can be applied to user groups and individual users.

Initially, these permissions are inherited from the global permission values. If you customize a permission for a particular node, that new value will now be inherited by any child nodes as well, unless they too customize the value.

### Differences from global permissions[#](#differences-from-global-permissions "Permanent link")

Node permissions are very similar in concept and application to the global user group and user permissions and the examples given above.

However, instead of defaulting to **No**, node permissions default to **Inherit**. If any custom permission value is set, it will be used instead of the inherited version; essentially, **Inherit** is the lowest priority permission value.

Note

There is one exception to this rule. If the inherited value is **Never**, it cannot be overridden, even by child nodes.

### Private nodes[#](#private-nodes "Permanent link")

When setting the permissions for a node, you have the option to make the node private. Enabling this will prevent all access except where explicitly granted.

This is ideal for creating staff-only forums. To do this, you would make the forum private and then set **View node** to **Yes** for the administrative and moderating user groups.

Note

The *Private forum* setting **only** affects the *View node* permission, without which all access to the node is denied. If a group is granted *View node* permission to a private node, the remainder of its permissions, such as *Post new thread* and *Post replies* are inherited from their standard user group permissions - there is no need to explicitly grant these permissions again using node permissions.

## Confirming permissions are correct[#](#confirming-permissions-are-correct "Permanent link")

To confirm that a user is receiving the permissions you expect, use the **Groups & permissions > Analyze permissions** system. This allows you to see the final yes/no value for each permission, along with all of the permissions that were considered leading up to that decision.

This analysis can be done for a user's global or node-specific permissions.

# XenForo 2.2.14 Released

  [Jan 30, 2024](/community/threads/xenforo-2-2-14-released.219044/)

* [Jan 30, 2024](/community/threads/xenforo-2-2-14-released.219044/post-1665320)
* [Replies: 2](/community/threads/xenforo-2-2-14-released.219044/#posts)

XenForo 2.2.14 is now available for all licensed customers to download. We strongly recommend that all customers running previous versions of XenForo 2.2 upgrade to this release to benefit from increased stability.

In addition to the usual slew of bug fixes and improvements, there are a few notable changes in this release.

### Compatibility with PHP 8.1 and 8.2​

Most compatibility issues between PHP 8.1 and 8.2 have been addressed. Remaining issues might trigger `E_DEPRECATED` warnings in the `xf_error_log` during debug mode, but these are generally non-critical and can be disregarded.

### Email unsubscribe changes​

Previously, we allowed users to unsubscribe from emails through certain mail clients when the automated unsubscribe handler was configured. With the introduction of XenForo 2.2.14, we're implementing a new standard feature that processes unsubscribe requests via HTTP. This feature is activated by default and requires no additional configuration. Your current settings for email unsubscribing will not be altered. The recent updates include:

* Enhanced handling of the `List-Unsubscribe` header to support both `mailto` and HTTP methods.
* Automatic inclusion of the unsubscribe header in a broader range of outgoing emails, such as notifications for watched threads and activity summaries.
* A default-enabled option to send confirmation emails to users once their unsubscribe request is fulfilled.

### Minor security fix​

In previous versions, add-on or style archives could escape their container directory and bypass subsequent validation checks. Exploiting this requires an administrator with the pertinent permissions to upload a maliciously-crafted archive. This has been addressed in XenForo 2.2.14. Thank you to Egidio Romano of [Karma(In)Security](https://karmainsecurity.com/) for reporting this issue.

### Update on XenForo 2.3 and XenForo 3.0​

Work continues towards the next versions of XenForo. [@Kier](https://xenforo.com/community/members/2/) is now working full time on some exciting stuff for XenForo 3.0 while the rest of us are working towards getting XenForo 2.3 stable enough for a public beta release, in addition to the last few bells and whistles for both the core software and some enhancements to our official add-ons. Additionally, we plan to release one last update for XenForo 2.2, namely XenForo 2.2.15, which will incorporate significant fixes before we transition to primarily supporting XenForo 2.3.

## [One-click upgrade to XenForo 2.2.14](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help)​

[**Directly from your admin control panel**](https://xenforo.com/goto/oc-upgrade-help)

## XenForo 2.2.14 Patch 2 Released​

Sincere apologies. A further issue has been identified in which initial upgrades to 2.2.14 may have set the default 'http' option for the unsubscribe option incorrectly.

The latest patch will workaround this issue if you are affected.

Alternatively, going to Options > Email options in your admin control panel and setting the "Unsubscribe email handling" option as desired will fix the issue without needing to upgrade.

This is being rolled out to existing Cloud customers automatically if affected.
