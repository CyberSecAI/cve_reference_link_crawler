{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to insecure parsing of XML data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "XXE Injection: The application did not properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing XML documents."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read local files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or cause a denial of service by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability could be exploited through the /rtc/post endpoint using the default rtc credentials by sending a crafted XML payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the /rtc/post endpoint with valid rtc credentials."
