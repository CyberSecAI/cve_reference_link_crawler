Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks" fails to properly validate and escape block attributes, specifically within the Lottie Animation block. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the Lottie Animation URL, which results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when the page/post containing the block is viewed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing session cookies and other sensitive information.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload into the "Lottie Animation URL" field of a Lottie Animation block within a WordPress post or page.
- The vulnerability is triggered when any user (including administrators, editors, authors, contributors, and visitors) views the page/post that contains the injected block and hovers the mouse over the generated image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least the "Contributor" role within the WordPress site, which allows them to create and edit posts.
- The attacker doesn't need any other special privileges.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of "Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks" prior to 3.2.37.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject malicious Javascript via the `onmouseover` event, which triggers when hovering over the lottie image.
