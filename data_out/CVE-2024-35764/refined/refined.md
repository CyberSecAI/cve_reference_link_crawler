- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject scripts that could lead to redirects, display advertisements, and execute other HTML payloads when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the site with the injected malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs contributor-level privileges to inject the malicious scripts.
