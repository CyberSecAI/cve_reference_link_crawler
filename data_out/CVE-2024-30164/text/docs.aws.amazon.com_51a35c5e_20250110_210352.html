These sections describe installing the AWS provided client for Linux and then establishing establish a
VPN connection using the AWS provided client. The AWS provided client for Linux does not support automatic

## Requirements for connecting to Client VPN with an AWS provided client for Linux

To use the AWS provided client for Linux, the following is required:

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (AMD64 only), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (AMD64 only), or Ubuntu
  24.04 LTS (AMD64 only)

The client reserves TCP port 8096 on your computer. For Client VPN endpoints that use
SAML-based federated authentication (single sign-on) the client reserves TCP port
35001.

Before you begin, ensure that your Client VPN administrator has [created a Client VPN endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoint-create.html)
and provided you with the [Client VPN endpoint configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoint-export.html).
