# AWS Client VPN for Windows

These sections describe how to establish a VPN connection using the AWS provided client for
Windows. You can download and install the client at [AWS Client VPN download](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/). The AWS provided client does not support automatic
updates.

## Requirements

To use the AWS provided client for Windows, the following are required:

* Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit operating system, x64 processor)
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher

The client reserves TCP port 8096 on your computer. For Client VPN endpoints that use
SAML-based federated authentication (single sign-on), the client reserves TCP port
35001.

Before you begin, ensure that your Client VPN administrator has [created a Client VPN endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoint-create.html)
and provided you with the [Client VPN endpoint configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/cvpn-working-endpoint-export.html).
