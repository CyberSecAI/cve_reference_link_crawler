{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from passing an uninitialized gisa origin to `virt_to_phys()` before writing it to the gisa designation in the SIE control block. This occurs when gisa is disabled via the kernel parameter `kvm.use_gisa=0` or the sysfs attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code fails to handle the case where gisa is disabled, leading to the usage of an uninitialized value for gisa origin.",
      "An invalid value in the SIE control block's gisa designation triggers a validity intercept."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a kernel panic triggered by a validity intercept (0x1011), which occurs during the attempt to start a new KVM guest, crashing the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves disabling the gisa feature via kernel parameter or sysfs attribute, followed by attempting to start a new KVM guest.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to control the kernel parameters or sysfs attributes related to KVM, specifically the `kvm.use_gisa` setting. The attacker would also require the ability to create/start KVM guests. This is usually a privileged user or someone who has root access.",
      "description": "The provided patches fix a validity interception issue in the KVM s390 implementation when the Guest Instruction Set Architecture (GISA) is switched off. This occurs due to the usage of an uninitialized gisa origin when constructing the SIE control block's gisa designation. The fix ensures a zero value is returned when gisa is disabled, preventing the invalid value from being written to the SIE control block. The issue is triggered during a new KVM guest start and results in a host kernel panic."
