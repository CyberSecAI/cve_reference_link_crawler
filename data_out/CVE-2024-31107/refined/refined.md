- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject scripts into a website. This could lead to redirects, displaying advertisements, or injecting other HTML payloads that will be executed when a user visits the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the pluginâ€™s input fields, and any user that visits the site will be affected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
