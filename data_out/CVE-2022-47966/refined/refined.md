        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated version (1.4.1) of Apache XML Security for Java (xmlsec) library in Zoho ManageEngine products. This version of xmlsec performs XSLT transformations before validating the XML signature, which can lead to remote code execution. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the way the xmlsec XSLT features are implemented, which makes the application responsible for certain security protections that were not adequately provided by the ManageEngine products.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use of vulnerable third-party library (Apache XML Security for Java 1.4.1)",
          "Improper order of operations during SAML processing (XSLT transformations before signature validation)",
          "Lack of sufficient security controls in the ManageEngine products using the vulnerable library",
          "Exposure of vulnerable services to the public internet",

          "Sending a crafted SAML response containing malicious XSLT transforms to a vulnerable ManageEngine application. The application processes the XSLT before the signature is validated, which allows for arbitrary code execution.",

       "additional_details": "The advisory also details how multiple nation-state APT actors were observed exploiting this vulnerability, along with CVE-2022-42475. The report provides a detailed timeline of attacker activity, tools used, MITRE ATT&CK techniques, and mitigations. It notes that APT actors achieved root level access, created local admin accounts, downloaded malware, enumerated the network, collected credentials, and moved laterally. Additionally, it mentions the use of legitimate tools like ConnectWise ScreenConnect, Mimikatz, and Ngrok for malicious purposes. Furthermore, it highlights the exploitation of disabled legitimate accounts and clearing of logs to evade detection. The advisory also notes that the lack of proper logging, network segmentation, and privilege management contributed to the incident's severity. The exploitation allowed attackers to gain a persistent foothold in the network and potentially exfiltrate data, although the exfiltration was not confirmed due to lack of logging. It was determined that the attacker leveraged multiple web shells to maintain persistence and move laterally."

The repository includes a Python script to exploit the vulnerability. It provides instructions on usage, mentioning that for Active Directory related products, an issuer argument is required. The README also contains links to technical analysis and indicators of compromise, and a disclaimer that the software should not be used to attack systems without authorization. It also mentions that modification of this POC to work on products that perform additional checks on the SAML response involves scanning the logs of the vulnerable product for stack traces or additional logs message indicating an invalid SAML response, and reverse engineering the vulnerable product and searching for the code that implements the checks. The repository also refers to blog posts detailing the root cause analysis and IOCs."

It includes CVSS scores, exploitability details, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and references to advisories, exploits, and other related resources. It notes that the vulnerability is exploited in the wild, and provides links to Metasploit modules and CISA KEV entries. It categorizes the vulnerability as being of very high attacker value, with easy to weaponize aspects for certain ManageEngine products like ServiceDesk Plus and moderate exploitability. It highlights that the vulnerability allows for privileged access.  The description mentions that exploitation is only possible if SAML SSO has ever been configured for a product, with some products requiring that SAML SSO is currently active. The analysis notes that different versions of ManageEngine use different versions of Apache Santuario and/or Xalan, but the versions targeted by most PoCs are using Santuario v1.4.1, which has trivial RCE issues. It also notes that other versions may be vulnerable to CVE-2014-0107 via Xalan, although this was not the main focus of research. It further notes that the Rapid7 incident response team had confirmed multiple instances of in-the-wild exploitation.  It details various products that are affected, and provides a technical analysis of the root cause, and also states that a patch was released several months prior to the disclosure.  Furthermore, this source indicates the existence of Metasploit modules for the exploitation of this vulnerability across various products."

It provides a detailed explanation of XML signature validation, the SAML information flow, and how XSLT transforms are used to achieve code execution. It also shows a code diff of vulnerable Santuario versions and demonstrates how to exploit ServiceDesk Plus via a crafted SAML response.  It further details how to exploit the AD related products which include more checks, making direct exploitation with the existing public PoC impossible without modifications. It mentions that the POC was tested against Endpoint Central, and provides instructions on how to enable SAML SSO on the vulnerable products.
