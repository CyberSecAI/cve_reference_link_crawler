- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vault LDAP auth method returns different error messages depending on whether a username exists in the configured LDAP system. This allows unauthenticated users to potentially enumerate valid accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User enumeration vulnerability through error message analysis.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate valid usernames in the configured LDAP system. This information could be used in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending authentication requests with different usernames to the Vault LDAP auth method and observing the returned error messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Vault server. No authentication is needed to perform this attack.
