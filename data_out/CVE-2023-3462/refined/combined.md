**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2023-24

**Affected Products / Versions:** Vault and Vault Enterprise, versions 1.13.0 through 1.14.0 and 1.13.4. Fixed in 1.14.1 and 1.13.5.

**Publication Date:** July 31, 2023

**Summary**

The Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) LDAP auth method allows unauthenticated users to potentially enumerate valid accounts in the configured LDAP system by observing the response error when querying usernames. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-3462, is fixed in Vault 1.14.1 and 1.13.5.

**Background**

The [LDAP auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/ldap) allows authentication using an existing LDAP server and user/password credentials.

**Details**

An external party reported that it was possible to enumerate LDAP user accounts through error messages returned when using Vault’s LDAP auth method.

A similar issue regarding user enumeration and LDAP was remediated [in December 2020](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2020-25-vault-s-ldap-auth-method-allows-user-enumeration/18984).

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Vault 1.14.1, 1.13.5, or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/sop-upgrade?in=vault/standard-procedures) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was reported by Jared Johnstone.
