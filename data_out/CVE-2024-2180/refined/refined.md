Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2180

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory information leak in the `zam64.sys` and `zamguard64.sys` drivers of Zemana AntiLogger. Specifically, the `0x80002020` IOCTL code within these drivers allows an attacker to obtain the kernel base address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Kernel Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is the ability to leak kernel memory, specifically the kernel base address.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `0x80002020` IOCTL code does not properly validate access, allowing unauthorized processes to retrieve sensitive kernel information.
- **Bypass of kASLR:** Leaking the kernel base address renders Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR) protection ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can successfully leak the kernel base address, a critical piece of information for further exploitation attempts.
- **Bypass of Security Protections:** Bypassing kASLR makes the system more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** While the memory leak itself may not be immediately critical, it significantly lowers the bar for more severe exploits by exposing system internals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited through local access to the system.
- **IOCTL calls:** The attacker must send specific IOCTL calls to the vulnerable drivers.
  - The attacker first needs to send `0x80002010` IOCTL with the process ID to authorize the IOCTL calls,
  - then the attacker sends the `0x80002020` IOCTL code, to trigger the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Ability to Interact with Kernel Drivers:** The attacker needs to send IOCTL commands to the vulnerable driver.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Zemana AntiLogger v2.74.204.664 is specifically mentioned as the vulnerable version.
- **Exploit Available:** An exploit for this vulnerability is publicly available.
- **Mitigation:** There is no patch currently available for this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue (CVSS base score of 5.5), but it is a building block for more severe exploitation as it makes other attacks easier to accomplish.
