Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of support for container authentication in IBM Engineering Lifecycle Optimization - Publishing (PUB) version 7.0.3. This means that the application does not properly handle or validate authentication requests originating from a container environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Container Authentication Support:** The core vulnerability is the absence of proper mechanisms to authenticate requests from a container, leading to potential security breaches. The system does not support container authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided text doesn't specify the exact impact of exploiting this lack of container authentication support. However, the bulletin suggests to not use container authentication, instead, use JTS authentication, which implies that the lack of proper container authentication could potentially lead to unauthorized access or other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a container environment trying to authenticate with IBM Engineering Lifecycle Optimization - Publishing. An attacker could exploit the lack of proper container authentication mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with IBM Engineering Lifecycle Optimization - Publishing from within a container environment and attempt to authenticate with the system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided document also mentions that the vulnerability is linked to CVE-2023-45187 and CVE-2023-45191, implying these CVEs are part of a set of vulnerabilities due to the same root cause related to server container authentication, and all are related to the fact that, from PUB 7.0.3, Container authentication is not supported.
*   The vulnerability affects PUB versions 7.0.2 and 7.0.3
*   A workaround is provided: Use JTS authentication instead of container authentication.
