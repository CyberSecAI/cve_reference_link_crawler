- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of J2K files within Kofax Power PDF, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted J2K file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious J2K file and have the user open this file in Kofax Power PDF.
