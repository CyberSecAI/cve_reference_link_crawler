Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-31162

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the `slack-morphism` library in Rust handled debug information for OAuth secrets. Specifically, sensitive information like Slack OAuth client secrets and tokens could be inadvertently exposed in application debug logs due to insufficient sanitization of debug output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive OAuth client information.
- **Insecure Debug Output:** The library's debug formatting of OAuth secret types was not secure, leading to the leakage of secrets.
- **CWE-1258:** The advisory references CWE-1258, which is "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes," although the description seems more aligned with information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential/accidental leaking of Slack OAuth client information:** If debug logs are captured and exposed, attackers could gain access to sensitive Slack OAuth credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to a Slack workspace, allowing an attacker to potentially send messages, access data, or perform other actions within the compromised Slack environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Logging:** The primary attack vector is through application logs. If these logs are stored, transmitted, or accessed by an attacker, the sensitive information can be retrieved.
- **Internal Access:** An attacker with access to an application's logs could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to application logs where the `slack-morphism` library is used with debugging enabled or in an environment where debug logs are captured.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the application server. They only require access to the log data generated by it.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.41 of the `slack-morphism` crate by implementing stricter and more secure debug formatting for OAuth secret types.
- The advisory also suggests workarounds, such as avoiding the printing or outputting of request and response data for OAuth and client configurations in logs.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix was implemented by improving the OAuth/signature verifier data types and error handling.
- It's recommended to update to version 0.41 or later of the `slack-morphism` crate to mitigate the issue.
