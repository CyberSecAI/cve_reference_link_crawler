**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The plugin does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input and escape output when rendering accordion content. Specifically, the `accordion_content_source` attribute is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input sanitization
- Inadequate output escaping

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages containing accordions.
- These scripts execute when a user views the affected page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Phishing attacks
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious scripts.
- The injection occurs through the `accordion_content_source` attribute when creating or editing an accordion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with at least Contributor-level privileges.
- The attacker must be able to create or modify accordions using the plugin's interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 2.3.4 of the "Easy Accordion – Best Accordion FAQ Plugin for WordPress" plugin.
- Version 2.3.5 addresses this vulnerability by implementing proper input sanitization and output escaping.
- The provided changeset shows that the `sanitize` function now uses `wp_kses` with allowed tags for title and description to sanitize the data.
- Additionally the changes include sanitization of various other inputs using `sanitize_text_field`, `rest_sanitize_boolean`, `eapro_sanitize_number_array_field`, `eapro_sanitize_border_field`, `eapro_sanitize_number_field`, `eapro_sanitize_color_group_field`
- The vulnerability was reported by Ngô Thiên An (ancorn_) of VNPT-VCI.
