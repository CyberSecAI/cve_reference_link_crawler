# SQL Injection via Protocol Message Size Overflow

## Package

nuget

Npgsql
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

>= 8.0.0, < 8.0.3 <= 4.0.13 >= 4.1.0, < 4.1.13 >= 5.0.0, < 5.0.18 >= 6.0.0, < 6.0.11 >= 7.0.0, < 7.0.7

## Patched versions

8.0.3 4.0.14 4.1.13 5.0.18 6.0.11 7.0.7

## Description

### Summary

The `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large.

This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message.

Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf.

### Impact

Attackers can issue arbitrary SQL statements to the database on behalf of the application. The final impact depends on the application that uses Npgsql, the data it stores in Postgres, etc.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
