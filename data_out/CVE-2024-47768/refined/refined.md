The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-47768.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication checks within the account recovery system. Specifically, there isn't a check to verify if the user has actually received the recovery email and entered the correct code before allowing a password reset.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authentication check in the password reset process.
- The server allows password updates after receiving only an email address, without verifying the code sent to that address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker who knows the email address of a target user can exploit this vulnerability to change the target's password without needing to access their email or the recovery code. This would result in unauthorized account access.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to know the email of the target user.
- The attacker would then use the `/account/recovery` websocket endpoint to initiate the password reset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the email of the target user
- The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable server.
