# No Auth Check When Updating Password In Account Recovery

Critical

[Superior126](/Superior126)
published
GHSA-hmv6-8fg8-7m6f
Oct 4, 2024

## Package

auth\_server.py
(Python)

## Affected versions

<=1.7.2

## Patched versions

>=1.7.3

## Description

### Impact

This vulnability has to do with the account recovery system where there does not appear to be a check to make sure the user has been sent the recovery email and entered the correct code. If the attacker knew the email of the target, they could supply the email and imeadetly prompt the server to update the password without ever needing the code.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in version 1.7.3.

### Workarounds

There are no current workarounds.

### Action Required

There is no action required from users. Lif Platforms will update their servers with the patch.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47768

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
