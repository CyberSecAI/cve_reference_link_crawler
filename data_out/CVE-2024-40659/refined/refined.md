**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service, which means that the service or functionality may become unavailable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **API Call:** The attack vector is an unauthorized call to the `getRegistration` API.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device to be able to call the `getRegistration` API with insufficient privileges to cause a denial of service.
-   **Ability to Trigger API Call:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate or trigger this API call from a non-system user context.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-40659
*   **Root Cause:** Improper permission check on `getRegistration` API, allowing unauthorized entities to trigger it.
