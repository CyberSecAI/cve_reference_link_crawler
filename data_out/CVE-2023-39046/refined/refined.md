Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of secret in TonTon-Tei\_waiting

**Root Cause:** The mini-app 'TonTon-Tei\_waiting' on Line exposes the 'client secret' in the response to a client-side request. Specifically, the response of the request to `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` contains the client secret.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded/Exposed Secret:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the client secret within the response of an HTTP request. Client secrets are intended to be kept confidential and server-side only.
*   **Insecure Communication:** The client secret is not being handled in a secure manner, it was exposed in the response to a client-side request, which can be intercepted and viewed by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Channel Access Token Acquisition:** The exposed client secret can be used to obtain a channel access token.
*   **Malicious Message Broadcasting:** With the channel access token, an attacker can broadcast malicious messages to users of the affected mini-app. This could include website links, fraud information, or other harmful content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** An attacker can intercept the response to the request `https://asia-northeast1-pibot-order-prod.cloudfunctions.net/userEntry` to obtain the client secret.
*   **Client-Side Access:**  The vulnerability is exploited by simply having the Line application installed and opening the 'TonTon-Tei\_waiting' mini-app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network requests made by the Line application.
*   **Basic Line App Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to use the Line application and open the 'TonTon-Tei\_waiting' mini-app to initiate the vulnerable request.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The client does not need to be authenticated to obtain the secret, simply accessing the mini-app is enough.

**Affected Version:** Line 13.6.1

**Summary:**
The 'TonTon-Tei\_waiting' mini-app within Line version 13.6.1 is vulnerable due to exposing a client secret in a network response. This allows an attacker to obtain a channel access token, and subsequently broadcast malicious messages to users.
