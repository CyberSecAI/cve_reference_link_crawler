- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An information exposure vulnerability exists where a local system administrator can unintentionally disclose secrets, passwords, and tokens of external systems due to them being stored in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext storage of sensitive information (secrets, passwords, and tokens) intended for external systems. This allows a read-only administrator with access to the config log to view this sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive credentials, potentially enabling unauthorized access to external systems.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the PAN-OS device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local system administrator or a read-only administrator who has access to the config log. High privileges are required.
