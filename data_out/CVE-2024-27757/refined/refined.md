Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue stemming from the lack of input sanitization in the "Gallery Name" field within the `tools/addons_model.php` component of Flusity-CMS v2.4.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input validation and sanitization on user-supplied data when creating/modifying a gallery name. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the application which is then executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing of session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Other client-side attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) since the attacker can inject the malicious payload via web requests.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the crafted input (UI:R).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to be able to access the affected functionality and insert the malicious code into the "Gallery Name" field.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Flusity-CMS v2.4.
*   There is no patch available because the author of Flusity CMS has discontinued its development.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a moderate severity.
*   The scope of the attack is changed (S:C), meaning the vulnerability can affect components beyond the immediate security scope of the vulnerable input field.
*   The proof of concept shows how the attacker injects the `<script>alert(1);</script>` and `<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>` code into the "Gallery Name" field.
