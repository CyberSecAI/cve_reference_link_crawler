  "CVE-2022-39266": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The `isolated-vm` package is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when untrusted v8 cached data is passed to the API through `CachedDataOptions`, allowing attackers to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code in the nodejs process.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of untrusted v8 cached data through the `CachedDataOptions` API, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
         "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)",
         "Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-693)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), enabling the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the nodejs process, potentially leading to total loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same logical network.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to pass untrusted v8 cached data to the vulnerable API through `CachedDataOptions`.",
       "additional_notes": "The issue was addressed by adding a warning in the documentation advising users to not accept cachedData payloads from users. The fix is not a code change but a documentation update."
