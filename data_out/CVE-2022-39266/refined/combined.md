#### Introduced: 30 Sep 2022

[CVE-2022-39266  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39266) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-693  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `isolated-vm` to version 4.3.7 or higher.

## Overview

[isolated-vm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/isolated-vm) is an Access to multiple isolates

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when untrusted v8 cached data is passed to the API through `CachedDataOptions`, by allowing attackers to bypass the sandbox and run arbitrary code in the nodejs process.

**Note:**

This issue has been addressed by improving the [documentation](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/218e87a6d4e8cb818bea76d1ab30cd0be51920e8).

״CachedData contains compiled machine code. That means you should not accept `cachedData`
payloads from a user, otherwise they may be able to run arbitrary code.״

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.6 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited *at the protocol level* to a logically adjacent topology.

  **Adjacent**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

### **[mehradn7](/mehradn7)** commented [Jul 25, 2023](#issue-1820457529)

| Hello,  What is the status of isolated-vm regarding [CVE-2022-39266](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv)?  The GitHub advisory states that versions up to 4.3.6 are vulnerable but does not mention any patched version.  Is the latest version of isolated-vm (4.6.0 at the time of writing) vulnerable to [CVE-2022-39266](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv "CVE-2022-39266")?  Thanks. |

| Hi [@laverdet](https://github.com/laverdet), thanks for the answer. If the cachedData option is not enabled by default, then one could expect the CVE to be marked as fixed in GitHub Advisory Database (and other CVE databases), it is strange that it's not the case, as all security scanning tools may mark this CVE as "not patched". |

| Hello [@laverdet](https://github.com/laverdet) advisory in this case has no 'Patched version' specified  [GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv "GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv")  and it looks like because of this it listed in SNYK advisory database as active  <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ISOLATEDVM-3037320>  while <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39266>  does not  if readme change here [218e87a](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/218e87a6d4e8cb818bea76d1ab30cd0be51920e8) "fixed" the issue please update advisory you published in github with 4.3.7 as 'Patched version' so people could use isolated-vm with their projects without rising red flags from security people  As I understand advisory in question is about lack of guidance for improper use-case with users supplying cached data which is there now so it is fixed right? This existing severe vulnerability in all advisory databases is really confusing, because it is like with latest version of nodejs - it goes have exec() option which could be used with insecure code and there is guidance on avoiding it but still they don't list every version of nodejs itself as vulnerable right?  Please update [CVE-2022-39266](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jjq-x548-rhpv "CVE-2022-39266") to sort this out.  Thank You! |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Introduced: 30 Sep 2022

[CVE-2022-39266  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39266) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-693  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `isolated-vm` to version 4.3.7 or higher.

## Overview

[isolated-vm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/isolated-vm) is an Access to multiple isolates

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when untrusted v8 cached data is passed to the API through `CachedDataOptions`, by allowing attackers to bypass the sandbox and run arbitrary code in the nodejs process.

**Note:**

This issue has been addressed by improving the [documentation](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/218e87a6d4e8cb818bea76d1ab30cd0be51920e8).

״CachedData contains compiled machine code. That means you should not accept `cachedData`
payloads from a user, otherwise they may be able to run arbitrary code.״

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.6 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited *at the protocol level* to a logically adjacent topology.

  **Adjacent**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
