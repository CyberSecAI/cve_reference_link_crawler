### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2022-39266  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39266) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-693  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `isolated-vm` to version 4.3.7 or higher.

## Overview

[isolated-vm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/isolated-vm) is an Access to multiple isolates

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when untrusted v8 cached data is passed to the API through `CachedDataOptions`, by allowing attackers to bypass the sandbox and run arbitrary code in the nodejs process.

**Note:**

This issue has been addressed by improving the [documentation](https://github.com/laverdet/isolated-vm/commit/218e87a6d4e8cb818bea76d1ab30cd0be51920e8).

״CachedData contains compiled machine code. That means you should not accept `cachedData`
payloads from a user, otherwise they may be able to run arbitrary code.״

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.6 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited *at the protocol level* to a logically adjacent topology.

  **Adjacent**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
