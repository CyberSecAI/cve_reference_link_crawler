The MultiVendorX – The Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'mvx_sent_deactivation_request' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to send a canned email to the site's administrator asking to delete the profile of an arbitrary vendor.
