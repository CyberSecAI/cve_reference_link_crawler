Hi Readers

Recently in one of my
pentest research, I found a CMS " WonderCMS" hosted in github.
Curious to explore its
functionalities, I downloaded and set it up in my local system.

After fiddling with the
source code, I found that it did not have any kind of security mechanism to
filter any user input and accepted and stored in blindly without any sort of
input validation

**Title of the
Vulnerability:**  Stored XSS
**Common Vulnerability Scoring
System:**7.0
**Vulnerability Class:** Injection
**Technical Details &
Description:** The application
source code is coded in a way which allows user input values to be stored and
processed by the application.
**CVE ID allocated**:  CVE-2017-14522
**Product & Service
Introduction:** Wonder CMS 2.3.1
WonderCMS is an open
source CMS (Content Management System) built with PHP, jQuery, HTML and CSS
(Bootstrap responsive).

WonderCMS doesn't
require any configuration and can be simply unzipped and uploaded to your
server/hosting provider. All data is saved to a text file (JSON format) which
is easily copied, moved, backed up and restored. WonderCMS runs on less than 50
functions and 850 lines of code and 5 files.

**Steps to Re-Produce –**
1.       Visit
the application
2.       Pass
any XSS payload into the application user input fields.
3.       The
XSS immediately pops up in next screen
4.       Now
every time the page is visited, the XSS gets triggered and thus becomes stored
XSS

**Exploitation Technique:** A attacker can perform session hijacking/
remote port scans as well as deface the site via XSS
**Severity Level:** High
**Security Risk:**
The presence of such a
risk can lead to user data compromise as well as site defacing.

**Affected Product
Version:**2.3.1
**Solution - Fix &
Patch:**The application code
should be configured in such a way, that any random user input be rejected and
client and server side validation should be ensured to filter html input and
javascript input

Step by step for the
attack:
