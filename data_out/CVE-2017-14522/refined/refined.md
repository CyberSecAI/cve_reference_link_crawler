- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application source code does not filter user input, allowing values to be stored and processed without any input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform session hijacking, remote port scans, and deface the website via XSS. This can lead to user data compromise and site defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious XSS payloads into any user input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the application and input values into user input fields.
