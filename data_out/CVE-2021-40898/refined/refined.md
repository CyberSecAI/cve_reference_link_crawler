{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `scaffold-helper` package is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack when processing specially crafted file paths.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `getProcessedPath` function handles excessively long or invalid file path strings, leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a malicious file path string that leads the `scaffold-helper` package to consume excessive resources, potentially crashing the application or making it unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `getProcessedPath` function, specifically by passing a crafted, very long, invalid path string. ",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have the ability to provide input to the vulnerable `getProcessedPath` function, such as by being able to control parameters passed into this function."
