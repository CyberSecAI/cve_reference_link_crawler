- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in certain areas, which allows attackers to perform unwanted actions on behalf of logged-in users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can trick logged-in users into performing actions such as deleting forms.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts an HTML page with a form that automatically submits to a vulnerable endpoint on the WordPress site, tricking the logged-in user to make the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious HTML page. The attacker has no control on the logged in administrator machine but must be able to make him visit an attacker controlled website.
