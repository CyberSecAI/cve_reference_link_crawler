[**sql\_manager\_invoice\_delete.md**](#file-sql_manager_invoice_delete-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **Pharmacy Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
* **Severity:** CRITICAL
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/php/manage_invoice.php?action=delete&invoice_number=1`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the **Pharmacy Management System** version 1.0, specifically in the **invoice deletion functionality**. This flaw occurs when the `invoice_number` parameter, used to delete an invoice, is not properly sanitized. Attackers can manipulate the parameter through a **GET** request, injecting arbitrary SQL commands that compromise the database’s security and integrity.

If successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows attackers to delete essential invoice records, exposing sensitive data or disrupting financial operations. Since no patch is currently available, this issue poses a severe risk and requires immediate remediation to prevent data breaches or system instability.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request demonstrating how the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `invoice_number` parameter:

```
GET /php/manage_invoice.php?action=delete&invoice_number=1%20AND%203315%3dBENCHMARK(5000000%2cMD5(0x6e527949)) HTTP/1.1
