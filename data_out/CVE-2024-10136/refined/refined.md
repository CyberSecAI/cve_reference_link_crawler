Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `invoice_number` parameter in the `manage_invoice.php` script of the Pharmacy Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied input (`invoice_number`) is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can delete critical invoice records, leading to loss of financial data.
*   **Data Exposure:** While not explicitly stated, SQL injection could potentially be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
*  **Disruption of Operations:** Deletion of records and potential system instability.
*   **Compromised Database Integrity:** Arbitrary SQL commands can be injected that could alter the database structure and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to the `/php/manage_invoice.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `invoice_number`.
*   The PoC demonstrates using the parameter to inject `AND 3315=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x6e527949))` to trigger a time-based injection.
*   The affected system is Pharmacy Management System version 1.0
*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/php/manage_invoice.php?action=delete`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content includes PoC request, Burp Suite and SQLMap screenshots for exploiting the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is described as "critical" and "unpatched."
