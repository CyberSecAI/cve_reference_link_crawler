- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Woffice Core plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications, data breaches, or other malicious activities depending on the specific vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a function lacking sufficient access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
