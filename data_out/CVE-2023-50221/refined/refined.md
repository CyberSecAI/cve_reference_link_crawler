**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `ResponseParser` method, which leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking the target into connecting to a malicious server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to set up a malicious server. The target user must connect to this malicious server to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
