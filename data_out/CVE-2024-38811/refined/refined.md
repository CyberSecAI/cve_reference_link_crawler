- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the usage of an insecure environment variable in VMware Fusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is code execution due to the insecure use of an environment variable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a malicious actor with standard user privileges to execute code within the context of the Fusion application. This could lead to complete system compromise due to the potential escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to have standard user privileges on the system where VMware Fusion is installed. The vulnerability is triggered by the insecure use of environment variables, but the specifics of how are not detailed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have standard user privileges on the MacOS system running the vulnerable version of VMware Fusion. No other specific capabilities are mentioned in the provided document.
