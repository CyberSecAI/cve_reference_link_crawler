- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "reset password" login page in dotCMS accepted HTML injection via URL parameters, specifically the `resetEmail` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTML Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into the password reset page. This could potentially be used for phishing attacks by displaying malicious content or links, or for defacement of the login page. The CVSS score indicates low impact to confidentiality and integrity, and no impact to availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring no special access privileges (PR:N), and user interaction (UI:R) is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious HTML code in the `resetEmail` parameter and induce a victim to click on it. This could be done by sending a crafted link in an email.
