# **CVE-2024-46482: XSS Vulnerability via uploading html and svg files**

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the application. The vulnerability occurs when attachments are uploaded during the ticket generation process. By uploading malicious .html and .svg files containing XSS payloads, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability when the recipient accesses the attachments. This exploit demonstrates that the application is vulnerable to XSS through file uploads, potentially allowing an attacker to send malicious files to any user, leading to unauthorized script execution.
