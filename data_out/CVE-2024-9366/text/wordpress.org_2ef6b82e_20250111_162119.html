### [Should be in default WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/should-be-in-default-wordpress/)

Default behaviour in WP is to OPEN a menuitem and THEN press DELETE. Tedious!
This plugin makes it all much simpler. You press the corect trashcan and away the menu (and subs) are. GREAT!

To the developer of this plugin
You have ripped off our code completely and not even bothered to change a single thing!
You’ll notice that our plugin is older than yours;
https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-menu-handler/
We have checked your code and its like for like, the only thing you have changed is the name of the image! I have reported you to Wordpress.

### [Worked great to hide menu items without deleting](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/worked-great-to-hide-menu-items-without-deleting/)

I had a client that wanted to hide some menu items for a certain time, this worked great. It also enables quick deleting menu items and deleting entire branches. Great work.
