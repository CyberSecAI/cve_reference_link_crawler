Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `.egi` file parsing functionality of The Biosig Project libbiosig. This occurs within the `sopen_extended` function when handling the `NEC` (number of event codes) field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when processing the `NEC` value within the `.egi` file format. Specifically, the code allocates a fixed-size buffer (`hdr->EVENT.CodeDesc`) and then uses `NEC` to index into this buffer, which can cause an out-of-bounds write if `NEC` is greater than a specific value (0x101), leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. The heap-based buffer overflow could overwrite heap metadata or other objects, potentially allowing an attacker to control the program's execution flow and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted `.egi` file that contains a large `NEC` value. When the vulnerable `libbiosig` library attempts to parse this file, the out-of-bounds write will occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.egi` file to the application using the vulnerable libbiosig library. This could involve convincing a user to open a malicious file or exploiting a service that processes .egi files. No specific privileges are required beyond being able to submit the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in The Biosig Project libbiosig 2.5.0 and Master Branch (ab0ee111).
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `sopen_extended` function during `.egi` file parsing.
- The fix for this vulnerability has been released in version 2.6.0 of the `biosig4c++` package.
- The vulnerability can be triggered if an odd `hdr->VERSION` is used.
- The `hdr->VERSION` is read in from the .egi file, and used to determine how to parse the rest of the data.
- The vulnerability is located in biosig.c:7579 in the sopen_extended function.
