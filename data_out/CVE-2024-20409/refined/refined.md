*   An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface.
*   An attacker could potentially access sensitive, browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote, targeting the web-based management interface.
*   The attacker would need to inject crafted input into various data fields of the interface.
*   The user must be tricked into interacting with the crafted input in order for the malicious script to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to craft malicious input and deliver it to the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco FMC software.
*   The attacker needs a user to visit a crafted link or otherwise trigger the execution of the injected script.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco FMC Software.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger group of XSS vulnerabilities affecting Cisco FMC, ASA, and FTD software.
* The CVSS score is 6.1.
