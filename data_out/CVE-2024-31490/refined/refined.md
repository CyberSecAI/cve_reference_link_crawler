- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability in FortiSandbox.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control leading to sensitive information disclosure. Specifically, authenticated users with read-only permissions can download diagnostic logs containing sensitive files via HTTP GET requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files by exploiting the diagnostic logs download functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP GET requests by an authenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least read-only access to the FortiSandbox appliance to be able to exploit the vulnerability.
