- **Root cause of vulnerability:** vsimk.exe in affected applications loads a specific tcl file from the current working directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427), where the application loads a file from a user-controlled location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker places a malicious tcl file in a user-writable directory. If an administrator or a process with elevated privileges launches vsimk.exe from that directory, the malicious code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to write files to a directory from which the application is launched. They also need to be able to convince a user with elevated privileges to launch the vulnerable application.
