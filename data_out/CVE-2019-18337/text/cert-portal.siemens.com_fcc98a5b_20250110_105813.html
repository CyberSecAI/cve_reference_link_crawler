SUMMARY

The Video Server application in SiNVR/SiVMS solutions contains two vulnerabilities involving authentica-
tion bypass (CVE-2019-18339) and information disclosure (CVE-2019-18340).

PKE has released an update of the application that fixes CVE-2019-18339. This update is not available
under the former Siemens OEM brand name SiNVR. For details contact PKE (https://pke.at/).

Siemens recommends specific countermeasures to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the Video Servers to ensure that only legitimate systems are
able to access the configured server ports. Harden all systems accordingly to prevent unauthorized
access

• CVE-2019-18339: SiNVR/SiVMS deployments with active Control Center Server (CCS) should
ensure that every video server and client has the Authorization Server set to “Control Center Server”
(Configuration -> Appearance -> Desktop -> Authorization Server)

• CVE-2019-18340: Harden the Video Servers to prevent local access by unauthorized users

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Control Center Server (CCS) is the optional central server component of PKE management solutions
(e.g., SiNVR/SiVMS). The CCS combines all centralized tasks within a server, such as database access
or user management.

SiNVR is the Siemens OEM version of SiVMS, a video management solution acquired by PKE Deutsch-
land GmbH and formerly distributed by Schille Informationssysteme GmbH. SiNVR/SiVMS is not to be
confused with the product Siveillance VMS. Note that SiNVR is no longer distributed or supported by
Siemens beyond version 3.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18339

The HTTP service (default port 5401/tcp) of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server contains an authentication
bypass vulnerability, even when properly configured with enforced authentication.

A remote attacker with network access to the Video Server could exploit this vulnerability to read the
SiVMS/SiNVR users database, including the passwords of all users in obfuscated cleartext.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:U/RC:C
CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18340

Both the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server and the Control Center Server (CCS) store user and device
passwords by applying weak cryptography.

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to extract the passwords from the user database and/or
the device configuration files to conduct further attacks.
