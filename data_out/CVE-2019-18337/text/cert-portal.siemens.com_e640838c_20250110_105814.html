SUMMARY

The advisory informs about multiple vulnerabilities in the Central Control Server (CCS) application, as
initially reported in SSA-761617 (https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-761617.html) on
2019-12-10 and SSA-844761 (https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-844761.html) on
2020-03-10.

The vulnerabilities involve authentication bypass (CVE-2019-18337, CVE-2019-18341), path traversal
(CVE-2019-18338, CVE-2019-19290), information disclosure (CVE-2019-13947, CVE-2019-18340, CVE-
2019-19291), privilege escalation (CVE-2019-18342), SQL injection (CVE-2019-19292), cross-site
scripting (CVE-2019-19293, CVE-2019-19294), and insufficient logging (CVE-2019-19295).

PKE has released an update for CCS that fixes the reported vulnerabilities, except for CVE-2019-18340.
For details contact PKE (https://pke.at/).

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and recommends specific countermeasures to
mitigate the vulnerabilities.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the CCS server to ensure that only legitimate systems are
able to access the configured CCS server ports. Harden the CCS server accordingly to prevent
unauthorized access. Consider to apply encryption and authentication on the network (e.g., via
TLS on application level or via IPSec on host level).

• CVE-2019-18340: Harden the CCS server to prevent local access by unauthorized users
• CVE-2019-19290, CVE-2019-19293, CVE-2019-19294: Disable the web interface of CCS if not
used. Alternatively, restrict access from localhost only, or only to trusted hosts of CCS administrators.
Enable TLS for the web interface of CCS.

• CVE-2019-19291: Disable the FTP service of the CCS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Control Center Server (CCS) is the optional central server component of PKE management solutions
(e.g., SiNVR/SiVMS). The CCS combines all centralized tasks within a server, such as database access
or user management.

SiNVR is the Siemens OEM version of SiVMS, a video management solution acquired by PKE Deutsch-
land GmbH and formerly distributed by Schille Informationssysteme GmbH. SiNVR/SiVMS is not to be
confused with the product Siveillance VMS. Note that SiNVR is no longer distributed or supported by
Siemens beyond version 3.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13947

The user configuration menu in the web interface of the Control Center Server (CCS) transfers user
passwords in clear to the client (browser).

An attacker with administrative privileges for the web interface could be able to read (and not only
reset) passwords of other CCS users.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18337

The Control Center Server (CCS) contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in its XML-based
communication protocol as provided by default on ports 5444/tcp and 5440/tcp.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18338

The Control Center Server (CCS) contains a directory traversal vulnerability in its XML-based commu-
nication protocol as provided by default on ports 5444/tcp and 5440/tcp.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18340

Both the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server and the Control Center Server (CCS) store user and device
passwords by applying weak cryptography.

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to extract the passwords from the user database and/or
the device configuration files to conduct further attacks.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18341

The SFTP service (default port 22/tcp) of the Control Center Server (CCS) contains an authentication
bypass vulnerability.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18342

The SFTP service (default port 22/tcp) of the Control Center Server (CCS) does not properly limit its
capabilities to the specified purpose.

In conjunction with CVE-2019-18341, an unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the
CCS server could exploit this vulnerability to read or delete arbitrary files, or access other resources
on the same server.
