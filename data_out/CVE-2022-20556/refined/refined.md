**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on launching Wi-Fi configuration settings when the settings UI is restricted, including for guest users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient access control: The system was not correctly preventing access to Wi-Fi configuration settings when the settings UI was restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Accessing restricted settings UI: The attacker needs to access the settings UI, specifically when the UI is meant to be restricted (such as guest user or similar).
- Launching Wi-Fi configuration settings: The attacker would need to find a way to launch Wi-Fi configuration settings through the vulnerable path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have access to a device where the settings UI is restricted. This could be a guest user or a user with specific profile restrictions.
-  Basic understanding of Android settings navigation to attempt to launch the Wi-Fi configuration settings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message and the Android Security Bulletin indicate that this issue is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability with a moderate severity.
- The fix involves restricting the launch of Wi-Fi configuration settings when the settings UI is restricted.
- The fix is part of the December 2022 Android Security Bulletin for Pixel devices and applies to Android version 13.
