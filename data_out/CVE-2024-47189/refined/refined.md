Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47189

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the API interface of the Audio, Web and Video Conferencing (AWV) component of Mitel MiCollab.
- The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, making the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data within the MiCollab database.
- Depending on the database privileges and application logic, a successful attack could also compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the API interface of the AWV component in Mitel MiCollab.
- The attacker would send crafted input to the API endpoints vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning an external attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability if the MiCollab API is exposed to the network.
- The attacker must be able to communicate with the vulnerable API endpoint of MiCollab.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory is identified as MISA-2024-0026
- The advisory was published on 2024-10-09.
