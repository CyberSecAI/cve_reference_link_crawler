Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36417

**Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `gf_isom_dovi_config_get` function within the `isomedia/avc_ext.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic heap-based buffer overflow, where the code attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region on the heap. Specifically, a read of size 8 bytes is attempted at a memory address that is outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Segmentation Fault:** The immediate impact observed is a segmentation fault, indicating a crash due to the program accessing memory it shouldn't.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** As stated in the Debian Security Advisory, this vulnerability "could result in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.". While the provided crash is a denial of service, heap overflows can be exploited to overwrite critical data structures or function pointers on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious MP4 File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MP4 file. The provided information includes a `poc.mp4` file which triggers the vulnerability.
*   **MP4Box Tool:** The vulnerability is exposed through the MP4Box tool in GPAC.  The `MP4Box -info poc.mp4` command is used to trigger the crash

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MP4 file to a user who is using a vulnerable version of the GPAC tool (MP4Box).
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to attempt to parse the malicious file with `MP4Box` using the `-info` argument.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** `gf_isom_dovi_config_get` in `isomedia/avc_ext.c:2435`
*   **Code Snippet:**
    ```c
    2428 GF_DOVIDecoderConfigurationRecord *gf_isom_dovi_config_get(GF_ISOFile* the_file, u32 trackNumber, u32 DescriptionIndex)
    2429 {
    2430  GF_TrackBox* trak;
    2431  GF_MPEGVisualSampleEntryBox *entry;
    2432  trak = gf_isom_get_track_from_file(the_file, trackNumber);
    2433  if (!trak || !trak->Media || !DescriptionIndex) return NULL;
    2434  entry = (GF_MPEGVisualSampleEntryBox*)gf_list_get(trak->Media->information->sampleTable->SampleDescription->child_boxes, DescriptionIndex - 1);
    2435  if (!entry || !entry->dovi_config) return NULL;
    2436  return DOVI_DuplicateConfig(&entry->dovi_config->DOVIConfig);
    2437 }
    ```
*   **ASan Output:**
    ```
