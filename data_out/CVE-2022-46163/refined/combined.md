# Data exfiltration via Ransack query injection

High

[hellcp](/hellcp)
published
GHSA-2wwv-c6xh-cf68
Jan 9, 2023

## Package

travel-support-program
(Deployment)

## Affected versions

< d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7

## Patched versions

>= d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7

## Description

### Impact

Sensitive user data (Bank Account Details, Password Hash) can be extracted via Ransack query injection. Every deployment of travel-support-program below the patched version is affected.

The travel-support-program uses the Ransack library to implement search functionality.

In its default configuration, Ransack will allow for query conditions based on properties of associated database objects [1]. The `*_start`, `*_end` or `*_cont` search matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate sensitive string values of associated database objects via character-by-character brute-force (A match is indicated by the returned JSON not being empty). A single bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, a password hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests, all within a few minutes.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in commit [d229162](https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program/commit/d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7)

### Workarounds

In order to work around this issue, you can also cherry pick that patch, however it will not work without the Rails 5.0 migration that was done in [#150](https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program/pull/150), which in turn had quite a few pull requests it depended on.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
