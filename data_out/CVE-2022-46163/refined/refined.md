Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-46163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of the Ransack library for search functionality in the `travel-support-program`. Ransack's default configuration allows for query conditions based on properties of associated database objects. This can be exploited to extract sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Ransack Query Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious queries via the Ransack search functionality.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The application allows for the extraction of sensitive information like bank account details and password hashes through crafted Ransack queries.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The Ransack library's default settings, which permit querying associated database objects, are insecure and lead to the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive user data including bank account numbers and password hashes, potentially leading to financial fraud and identity theft.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a high level of data confidentiality loss as unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Ransack Search Functionality:** The attack is carried out through the application's search interface by injecting crafted Ransack queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or prior access to the system.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any interaction from legitimate users.
- **Knowledge of Ransack Syntax:** The attacker needs to be familiar with Ransack's syntax and its capabilities for querying associated database objects.
- **Ability to Send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by using `*_start`, `*_end`, or `*_cont` search matchers to brute-force sensitive string values character by character.
- A single bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, and a password hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests.
- The issue was patched in commit `d22916275c51500b4004933ff1b0a69bc807b2b7`, which restricts the ransackable attributes and associations.
- A workaround involves cherry-picking the patch along with the Rails 5.0 migration done in pull request #150.

The provided information gives more technical detail than the typical CVE description, including the specific technique used to exploit the vulnerability (character-by-character brute-force) and the number of requests needed for extraction.
