Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-45687:

**Root Cause:** Session Fixation on the remote administration server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The remote administration server's API does not properly validate the `SRTSession` header when an administrator authenticates using an `Authorization` header.
*   An attacker can set the `SRTSessionid` header to a known value including "null" during the initial authentication of the admin user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   If an attacker can either steal a valid session token or trick an administrator into using a session token known by the attacker, the attacker can gain administrative access to the system.
*   The attacker can then leverage this administrative access to write arbitrary files to the file system, potentially leading to remote code execution by:
    *   Creating a new user with an arbitrary home folder.
    *   Logging into a file-upload service using that new account.
    *   Uploading malicious files such as a modified authorized_keys file for SSH access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to trick an administrator to send a request to the server with a specific `SRTSessionid` value set by the attacker.
*   Alternatively, the attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid `SRTSessionid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or influence an administrator's HTTP request.
*   The attacker needs to have some level of network access to reach the administration server.
*   The attacker needs to trick the administrator into authenticating with a session id provided by the attacker (or somehow steal the valid session ID).
*   The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of how to make HTTP requests.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**
*   The vulnerability affects both Linux and Windows versions of Titan MFT and Titan SFTP, although the exploit path for Windows would be different from the Linux path described in the blog post.
*   The blog post clarifies that this was initially misidentified as an authentication bypass but was later found to be a session fixation vulnerability. The `SRTSessionId` value must match on both the client and server for the session to be valid.
*   The blog provides a specific example of how to craft a malicious request and how to obtain remote code execution using this vulnerability in a Linux environment.
