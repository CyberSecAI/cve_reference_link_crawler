Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the communication design of Yokogawa's CAMS for HIS (Consolidation Alarm Management Software for Human Interface Station). This is categorized as a violation of secure design principles. Specifically, the system allows for the potential misuse of stored credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657):** The core weakness lies in how CAMS for HIS handles credentials. When a system is compromised, the stored credentials can be used to access and manipulate data on other CAMS for HIS systems.
- **Insecure Credential Handling:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that credentials stored on one system can be used to authenticate against other systems, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- **Data Breach/Leakage:** An attacker can access data managed by another CAMS for HIS, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.
- **Data Tampering/Modification:** Attackers may alter the data managed by other CAMS for HIS instances.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker can create unnecessary files on another CAMS for HIS, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.
- **Denial of Service:** Ultimately, the attack can disable CAMS for HIS functionality on affected machines due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised System:** The primary attack vector involves compromising a computer that has CAMS for HIS software installed.
- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to a system running the vulnerable CAMS for HIS software.
- **Knowledge of Credentials:** Once a system is compromised, the attacker needs to be able to access and utilize stored account and password information to access other systems.
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same network or a network segment that is adjacent to the vulnerable system.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
The following Yokogawa products and versions are affected:
- **CENTUM CS 3000** (including CENTUM CS 3000 Small): R3.08.10 to R3.09.00 (affected if LHS4800 (CAMS for HIS) is installed)
- **CENTUM VP** (including CENTUM VP Small, CENTUM VP Basic):
    - R4.01.00 to R4.03.00 (affected only if CAMS function is used)
    - R5.01.00 to R5.04.20 (affected regardless of CAMS function usage)
    - R6.01.00 to R6.09.00 (affected regardless of CAMS function usage)
- **Exaopc**: R3.72.00 to R3.80.00 (affected if NTPF100-S6 "For CENTUM VP Support CAMS for HIS" is installed)
- **B/M9000CS**: R5.04.01 to R5.05.01
- **B/M9000 VP**: R6.01.01 to R8.03.01

**Mitigations:**
- **Upgrade/Migration:** For older systems (CENTUM CS 3000, CENTUM VP R4.01.00-R4.03.00, R5.01.00-R5.04.20), the recommended mitigation is to migrate to the latest version of CENTUM VP.
- **Patches:** For CENTUM VP (R6.01.00 to R6.09.00), upgrade to R6.09.00 and apply patch R6.09.03. For Exaopc (R3.72.00 to R3.80.00), upgrade to R3.80.00 and apply patch R3.80.01.
- **B/M9000 Update:** While B/M9000CS and VP are not directly affected, if CENTUM is installed on the same PC, it is necessary to update CENTUM and B/M9000 to the latest version.
