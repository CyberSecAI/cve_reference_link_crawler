Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a violation of secure design principles within Yokogawa's Consolidation Alarm Management Software for Human Interface Station (CAMS for HIS). Specifically, it appears the software does not properly isolate credentials or session data between different instances or machines using the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657):** The core issue is that CAMS for HIS allows a compromised machine to leverage its credentials to access data from other machines running the same software. This indicates a lack of proper security boundaries between CAMS for HIS instances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain access to data from other machines using CAMS for HIS software.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can disable CAMS for HIS software functions on affected machines, causing a potential disruption of operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromise of a CAMS for HIS machine:** The attacker must first compromise a machine running CAMS for HIS software. This is the initial point of entry for the attack.
- **Lateral Movement:** Once a machine is compromised, the attacker uses the compromised credentials to access other machines on the same network that are also running CAMS for HIS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to a system that is running the vulnerable version of CAMS for HIS.
- **Network Proximity:** The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable, implying that the attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable systems.
- **Privilege:** It is implied that the attacker does not require user interaction to leverage the vulnerability once initial access is gained. The CVSS vector indicates no required privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 with a vector string of AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H, indicating an adjacent network attack with high complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, with low confidentiality and integrity impact, and a high availability impact.
- The affected products include various versions of Yokogawa's CENTUM CS 3000, CENTUM VP, Exaopc, B/M9000CS and B/M9000 VP.
- The advisory indicates that no public exploits are known, however, it also indicates it is not remotely exploitable, requiring the attacker to have adjacent access to the vulnerable machines.
- Mitigations include updating to the latest versions and applying security patches provided by Yokogawa, or upgrading to the latest version of CENTUM VP for end-of-life products.
