- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fromSafeClientFilter` function of the Tenda FH1206 router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `sprintf` function is used to construct a string using a user-provided `page` parameter without proper bounds checking. This allows a crafted, oversized `page` parameter to overflow the `v15` buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/goform/SafeClientFilter` endpoint, including an oversized `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router. This typically implies they are on the same network or have network access to the device.
