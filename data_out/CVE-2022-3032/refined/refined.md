Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-3032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Thunderbird handles HTML emails containing an `iframe` element with a `srcdoc` attribute. Specifically, remote objects specified within the HTML document defined by the `srcdoc` attribute were not being blocked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to block remote content within an iframe's srcdoc attribute.
- Allowing network requests for remote resources specified in nested HTML documents, even when remote content blocking is enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Display of remote content, such as images or videos, embedded within an email, potentially revealing a user's IP address or other information to a malicious server.
- Bypassing Thunderbird's remote content blocking mechanism.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTML email containing an `iframe` element with a `srcdoc` attribute.
- The `srcdoc` attribute defines the inner HTML document that contains remote resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send emails to a Thunderbird user.
- Requires the Thunderbird user to open the malicious email.
