Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which does seem to relate to CVE-2024-24105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **SQL Injection** vulnerability in the `adminFormvalidation.php` file of the "Computer Science Time Table System" version 1.0. This suggests that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** The vulnerability can lead to code execution on the server. This indicates a high severity level since the attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack type is categorized as "Local". However, this is likely a mistake, as SQL Injection is typically an attack that can be performed remotely over a network (as long as the vulnerable application is exposed).
    The "local" in this context might mean that the user needs local access to the application's interface to trigger the vulnerability by manipulating input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `adminFormvalidation.php` either directly, if local, or indirectly through the web application interface where the vulnerable script is called, injecting malicious SQL code into the input fields.
*   The attacker would need knowledge of the application's structure, particularly the forms and parameters related to `adminFormvalidation.php`, as well as basic SQL injection techniques.

**Summary**

The provided content describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Computer Science Time Table System v1.0, specifically within the `adminFormvalidation.php` file. This vulnerability allows for potential code execution on the server, presenting a significant risk. The attack vector is described as "local", which may be inaccurate.
