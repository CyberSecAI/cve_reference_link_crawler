Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5092

**Description:** The Elegant Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists in the Switcher, Slider, and Iconbox widgets of the plugin in versions up to and including 1.0.8.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the affected widgets. This means that when a user with Contributor-level access or higher enters malicious code into certain fields of these widgets, the code is not properly cleaned before being saved to the database or displayed on the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to store malicious JavaScript code within the website's database through the plugin's widgets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  *   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious web scripts into pages.
  *   **Code Execution:** When a user visits an affected page, the injected malicious scripts will execute within their browser.
  *  **Account Takeover:**  The scripts could be designed to steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
  *   **Defacement:** The site can be defaced with malicious content.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
  *   **Plugin Widgets:** The attack vector is through the Switcher, Slider, and Iconbox widgets of the Elegant Addons for Elementor plugin.
    *   Specifically, user input fields associated with these widgets are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  *   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an authenticated user account on the target WordPress site.
  *   **Minimum Role:** The account must have at least Contributor-level access or higher. This is the minimum level of permissions that allow users to create and edit content.
  *   **Access to Elementor Editor:** The attacker needs access to the Elementor page builder to manipulate the plugin's widgets.

**Additional Details:**
  *   The vulnerability was reported by stealthcopter.
  *   Wordfence has assigned this a severity rating of 6.4 (Medium).

**Affected Files (as per Wordfence references):**
  *   `eae-switcher.php` (Line 516)
  *   `eae-slider.php` (Line 1091)
  *   `eae-iconbox.php` (Line 1667)

**Mitigation:**
  *   As of the report date, there is no official patch available for this vulnerability.
  *   Until a patch is available, it is highly recommended that you disable the plugin if possible or remove it from the website.

The provided source code snippets of `eae-iconbox.php`, `eae-switcher.php`, and `eae-slider.php` confirm that these are the relevant files and provide context for understanding the vulnerable code. The line numbers mentioned in the Wordfence article correspond to the code that renders the content, where the sanitization/escaping is likely missing.
