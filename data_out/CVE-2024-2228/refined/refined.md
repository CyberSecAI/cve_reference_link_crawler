**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2228

**Description:** This CVE relates to a vulnerability in SailPoint IdentityIQ concerning the authorization of QuickLink target identities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper authorization checks related to QuickLink target identities within SailPoint IdentityIQ. The exact nature of the improper authorization is not detailed in the provided text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The system fails to properly validate the authorization of QuickLink target identities. This suggests a lack of checks or flawed logic in how the system determines if a user is permitted to access or interact with a specific target identity via a QuickLink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to or perform unauthorized actions on target identities via QuickLinks. The full extent of the impact is not explicitly stated, but it implies potential privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, or unauthorized manipulation of target identities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **QuickLinks:** The vulnerability is exploited via the use of QuickLinks within the SailPoint IdentityIQ system. QuickLinks appear to be shortcuts that allow users to quickly access or act on specific identities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be a user of the SailPoint IdentityIQ system. The attacker must have some form of access to the system to leverage QuickLinks.  The specific level of access necessary is not provided, but it is implied to be not an administrative level access.
