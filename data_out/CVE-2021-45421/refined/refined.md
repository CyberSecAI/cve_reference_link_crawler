Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-45420, which is closely related to CVE-2021-45421:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Write

*   **Root Cause:** The Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 product has insecure CGI scripts that allow writing arbitrary files to the target system. The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file names and paths, allowing external control of these parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path. The application allows the attacker to specify the filename and path to be written.
    *   Lack of Authentication: The file write operation can be performed without authentication, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can fill the filesystem with arbitrary data, leading to a denial of service by exhausting available storage space.
    *   Potentially other impacts: While the primary impact is DoS, arbitrary file write can lead to further impacts depending on the system's configuration and what files are overwritten by the attacker.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP requests to vulnerable CGI scripts:
        *   `http://<target>/cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi`
        *   `http://<target>/cgi-bin/cal_save.cgi`
        *    `http://<target>/cgi-bin/lo_utils.cgi`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the target device.
    *   No Authentication Required: No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability:** Directory Listing

*   **Root Cause:** The web server is configured to allow directory listing, which exposes the file structure of the server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   CWE-548: Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing. The webserver lists the files present in the directories.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Attackers can see the server's directory structure, potentially revealing sensitive files, including hidden CGI scripts, and can aid in finding other potential exploitation vectors.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP requests to specific directories:
        *   `http://<target>/<folder>/`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the target device.
    *   No Authentication Required: No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also states that the Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 product has been unsupported since 2018 and customers are advised to remove or replace the device.
*   The arbitrary file write vulnerability is rated as High severity (CVSSv3 7.5), while the directory listing is rated as Medium (CVSSv3 5.3).
*   Reverse engineering was used to find hidden CGI scripts based on the discovered information disclosure from the directory listing vulnerability.
