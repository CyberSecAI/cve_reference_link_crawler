* Dixell **XWEB-500**

Detected vulnerabilities were:

| Vulnerability | Assets | CVSSv3 | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Arbitrary File Write** | http://<target>/cgi-bin/logo\_extra\_upload.cgi http://<target>/cgi-bin/cal\_save.cgi  http://<target>/cgi-bin/lo\_utils.cgi | **7.5** | **HIGH** |
| **Directory Listing** | http://<target>/cgi-bin/lo\_utils.cgi | **5.3** | **MEDIUM** |

In the following section we are reporting some technical details on these vulnerabilities including evidences and proof-of-concepts.

# 2.Vulnerability details

#### Arbitrary File Write

CWE-73: *External Control of File Name or Path*
CVSSv3: **7.5**[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H]

Description

Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 products are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write attack. An attacker will be able to write any file on the target system without any kind of authentication mechanism, and this can lead to filesystem space bursting and, as so a Denial of Service.

### Assets

* http://<target>/cgi-bin/logo\_extra\_upload.cgi
* http://<target>/cgi-bin/cal\_save.cgi
* http://<target>/cgi-bin/lo\_utils.cgi

### Proof of Concept

The next images represent the evidence of the vulnerability and how it was possible to write any files into the filesystem using the CGIs listed in the previous sections:

## Directory Listing

CWE-548: *Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing*
CVSSv3: **5.3** [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N]

### Description

Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 products are affected by Information Disclosure via Directory Listing. A potential attacker can use this misconfiguration to access all the files present in the directories.

In this particular case, we found that the java directory was very interesting because contains many .jar files that have been used to find hidden cgi. Furthermore, this can allow finding other exploitation vectors using reverse engineering techniques.

### Assets

* http://<target>/<folder>/

### Proof of Concept

The next images represent the evidence of the vulnerability and how it was possible to list the files:

Evidence 6 Directory Listing

Below is a sample of the reverse engineering process to find some hidden cgi:
