- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal in the SPX REST authorization handler of the NVIDIA BMC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An unauthorized attacker can exploit a path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This may lead to escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required, with low complexity. The attacker must have low privileges on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with low privileges.
