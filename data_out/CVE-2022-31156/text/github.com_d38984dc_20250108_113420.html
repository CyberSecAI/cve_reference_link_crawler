# Dependency verification can ignore checksum verification when signature verification cannot be performed

Moderate

[ljacomet](/ljacomet)
published
GHSA-j6wc-xfg8-jx2j
Jul 14, 2022

## Package

Gradle
(Java)

## Affected versions

6.2 to 7.4.2

## Patched versions

7.5

## Description

### Impact

Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures.

In some cases, Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact.

This can occur in two ways:

* When signature verification is disabled but your verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element.
* When signature verification is enabled, your verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository.

In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry.

For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks:

* Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting.
* Man In The Middle: If you are still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, your build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one.

### Patches

Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason.

### Workarounds

* Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation.
* Do not add `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
