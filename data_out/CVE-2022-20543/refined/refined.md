```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking on the `TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE` setting. The animation scale setting was not bounded between 0 and 20.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A large animation scale value can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially manipulate the `TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE` setting to an arbitrarily large value.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to modify system settings, likely through a malicious application or by directly manipulating system properties if they have sufficient access."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided information indicates that the fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that all uses of the `TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE` setting are bounded between 0 and 20, preventing the denial of service. Multiple commits are listed as fixing this issue"
