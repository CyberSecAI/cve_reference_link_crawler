# SSH option injection

Low

[cyrilst](/cyrilst)
published
GHSA-jmqp-37m5-49wh
May 14, 2024

## Package

gomod

sshproxy
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<1.6.3

## Patched versions

1.6.3

## Description

### Impact

Any user authorized to connect to a ssh server using `sshproxy` can inject options to the `ssh` command executed by `sshproxy`.

All versions of `sshproxy` are impacted.

### Patches

The problem is patched starting on version 1.6.3

### Workarounds

The only workaround is to use the `force_command` option in `sshproxy.yaml`, but it's rarely relevant.

### References

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
