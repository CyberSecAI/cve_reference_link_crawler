Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper input validation within the `cgiserver.cgi`'s JSON command parser. The code assumes that the `param` value within a JSON command is always a JSON object, but this is not enforced. When a different data type such as a string is provided instead of a JSON object, the program attempts to access it as if it were an object using the subscription operator `[]`, which leads to an assertion failure and subsequent reboot of the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application fails to validate the data type of the `param` field in the JSON request.
- **Type Confusion:**  The code attempts to treat a string as a JSON object, leading to an assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a non-object `param` value, an attacker can force the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash, which leads to a device reboot and temporary loss of camera functionality.
- **Device Instability:** Repeated attacks could result in continuous reboots, rendering the device unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint of the device.
- **JSON Payload:** The malicious request contains a JSON array in the body, where the `param` field of a command is set to a string, instead of a JSON object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
- **Authentication:** While most of the vulnerabilities require a logged-in user, they can be exploited without authentication using a related vulnerability TALOS-2021-1420.

**Specifics related to CVE-2021-44408**

This CVE specifically concerns the `TestFtp` command. The `TestFtp`'s JSON `param` parser assumes that the `param` JSON element is an object, and if a string is provided instead it leads to a denial-of-service (device reboot) condition.
