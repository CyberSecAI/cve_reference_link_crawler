Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** WordPress Webpushr Plugin

**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 4.35.0

**Fixed Version:** 4.36.0

**Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input or data before displaying it, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website. These injected scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to:
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Display of unwanted advertisements
*   Stealing of user session cookies or other sensitive information
*   Defacement of the website
*   Other arbitrary actions controlled by the attacker

**Attack Vectors:**  The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the plugin's functionality, which are then executed by the victim's browser.  The specific method of injection isn't detailed but the vulnerability is unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability
*   The attacker needs to find a way to inject the malicious script, likely through a user-supplied input or data that is not properly sanitized.
