  "CVE-2021-34973": {
    "summary": "The application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents. An attacker could exploit this to access resources or execute malicious actions by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Untrusted URL Invocation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers could access resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents.",
         "Exploiting the application's behavior of loading images from all resources when parsing XFA documents."
