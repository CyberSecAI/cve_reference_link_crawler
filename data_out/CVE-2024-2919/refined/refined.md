Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2919

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the CountUp Widget of the Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This script is then executed in the user's browser when they visit the affected page.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The core issue is that the plugin doesn't sanitize or escape input within the `prefix`, `suffix`, and `separator` data attributes of the `kb-count-up` element before using it to construct HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Account Compromise:** Attackers could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal sensitive information or modify data on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `prefix`, `suffix`, and `separator` attributes of the CountUp Widget in a way that injects malicious JavaScript code when the affected page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access (Contributor+)**: The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site, which allows them to create or edit posts or pages where the vulnerable widget can be placed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.2.31.
- The patch implemented in version 3.2.32 utilizes the `stripHtml` function to remove any HTML tags from the potentially vulnerable attributes before constructing the HTML output, thus preventing script injection.
- The vulnerable attributes are `data-prefix`, `data-suffix`, and `data-separator` of the `kb-count-up` element.
