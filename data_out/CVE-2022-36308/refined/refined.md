  "CVE-2022-36308": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Airspan's AirVelocity 1500 eNB devices store SNMPv3 credentials in plaintext due to improper handling by the web UI.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The web UI writes SNMPv3 passwords to a configuration file (`/bsdata/snmpd.conf`) that is not managed by `snmpd`, preventing `snmpd` from automatically hashing the passwords. Additionally, the web UI displays all SNMP credentials in plaintext.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords",
        "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with access to the device's file system or web UI can gain access to the plaintext SNMPv3 credentials or view them through the web UI and potentially use them to compromise other systems using the same credentials.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing the device's file system",
        "Accessing the web UI of the device"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
         "Ability to access the filesystem of affected devices.",
         "Ability to login to the web interface of the device."
      ],
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists because the Airspan web UI writes SNMPv3 passwords to `/bsdata/snmpd.conf` instead of `/home/swuser/snmp/snmpd.conf` where they would be hashed by snmpd. The web UI also displays all current SNMP credentials in plaintext."
    }
