- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VAPIX API `overlay_del.cgi` is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability in the `overlay_del.cgi` API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows for deletion of files on the system. Impact is lower with operator accounts, limited to non-system files; however, with administrator privileges system files can also be deleted.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via the VAPIX API `overlay_del.cgi`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires authentication with an operator or administrator-privileged service account.
