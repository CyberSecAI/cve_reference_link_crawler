Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mage AI application allows unauthenticated access to terminal server command history.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of terminal command history to unauthorized users.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:**  The system fails to properly authenticate or authorize users attempting to access terminal history, leading to the infoleak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view the command history of arbitrary users. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information like credentials, paths, or other commands containing secrets.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Revealed commands might contain information that could aid in further attacks, such as discovering internal systems, API keys, or specific configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Access:**  The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific WebSocket request to the `/websocket/terminal` endpoint.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Mage AI instance.
*   **No prior knowledge or credentials:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Additional notes:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) gives the exact WebSocket endpoint format required to trigger the vulnerability, making it easily reproducible.
*   The lack of mitigations highlights the critical nature of the flaw and the need for immediate patching/fixes.
* The CVE description is a placeholder, and this document provides useful details.
