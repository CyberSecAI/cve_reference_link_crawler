- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `terminal-xhr.php` file in Icecoder 8.1 directly uses user-supplied input from the `command` parameter of the `$_REQUEST` array without any sanitization or filtering.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the direct inclusion of unfiltered user input into the output HTML.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser, allowing for various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, and phishing.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a specially crafted `GET` request to the `/lib/terminal-xhr.php` endpoint with the malicious JavaScript code in the `command` parameter. The attacker needs the CSRF token which can be accessed from the index.php

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they can access the vulnerable instance of Icecoder.
