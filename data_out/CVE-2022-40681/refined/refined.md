Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authorization issue in FortiClient (Windows). Specifically, a low-privileged user can exploit this to delete arbitrary files.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization):** The core vulnerability is that the software does not properly authorize file deletion operations, allowing an unprivileged user to perform actions they should not be able to.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker can delete any file in the filesystem.
    * **Denial of Service:** The arbitrary file deletion can result in a denial of service by deleting critical system or application files.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker only needs to be a local user with low privileges.
