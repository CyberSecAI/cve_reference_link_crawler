Package        : bind9
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2795 CVE-2022-3080 CVE-2022-38177 CVE-2022-38178

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation.

CVE-2022-2795

    Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr and Shani Stajnrod discovered that a
    flaw in the resolver code can cause named to spend excessive amounts
    of time on processing large delegations, significantly degrade
    resolver performance and result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-3080

    Maksym Odinintsev discovered that the resolver can crash when stale
    cache and stale answers are enabled with a zero
    stale-answer-timeout. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via specially
    crafted queries to the resolver.

CVE-2022-38177

    It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the ECDSA
    algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
    resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-38178

    It was discovered that the DNSSEC verification code for the EdDSA
    algorithm is susceptible to a memory leak flaw. A remote attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause BIND to consume resources,
    resulting in a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.16.33-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
