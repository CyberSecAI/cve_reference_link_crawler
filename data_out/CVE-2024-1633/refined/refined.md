- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow when calculating the image length during secure boot. A 32-bit unsigned integer read from the image certificate is multiplied by four and saved into another 32-bit unsigned integer. This operation can result in an overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow (CWE-190), leading to potential bypass of memory range restrictions. The calculated size, which may have overflowed, is used in memory range checks and during data copy.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially bypass memory range restrictions and write data out of bounds, leading to secure boot bypass and potentially arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves writing to the flash area used by the bootloader, thereby modifying the image length in the certificate to trigger the integer overflow.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -   Ability to write to the flash area used by the bootloader.
