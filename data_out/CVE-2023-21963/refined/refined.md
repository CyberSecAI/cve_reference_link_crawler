Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-21963:

**Verification:**

1.  **Oracle Advisory:** The Oracle document lists CVE-2023-21963 within the MySQL Server Risk Matrix section, indicating it's a vulnerability affecting MySQL Server.
2.  **NetApp Advisory:** The NetApp advisory directly references CVE-2023-21963 as part of a list of CVEs related to "April 2023 MySQL Server Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products".

Therefore, both documents confirm that the content is related to CVE-2023-21963.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The Oracle document states the vulnerability is in the "Server: Connection Handling" component of MySQL Server.
    *   The NetApp document provides a broader summary, indicating the vulnerability could lead to "unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server." The specific cause (connection handling) is not mentioned in the NetApp summary.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper handling of connections within the MySQL server could allow an attacker to exploit the server.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   According to the NetApp advisory, exploitation can result in:
        *   Unauthorized takeover of the MySQL server.
        *   Unauthorized access to or modification of MySQL server data.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) through server crashes or hangs.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The Oracle advisory specifies the attack vector as "MySQL Protocol," implying the vulnerability is exposed over the network through the MySQL protocol.
    *   The NetApp advisory also references the vulnerability is network exploitable.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The Oracle document indicates the vulnerability cannot be remotely exploited without authentication, however, once authenticated, the attacker could be in a network position to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   The NetApp advisory mentions high privileges are needed for this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Oracle:** The Oracle document provides affected product versions and CVSS 3.1 scores but doesn't offer a detailed explanation of the vulnerability's mechanism. It focuses on the affected components and the risk associated with them.
*  **NetApp:** The NetApp advisory confirms the impact detailed by Oracle, and emphasizes the need for patching NetApp products to mitigate the MySQL Server vulnerabilities, providing links to NetApp products downloads containing the patches.

**Summary:**

CVE-2023-21963 involves a vulnerability in MySQL Server's connection handling mechanism that can allow a high privileged attacker to cause a denial of service. The vulnerability is accessible through the network over the MySQL protocol. Oracle provides the component affected and NetApp clarifies the impact on their products.
