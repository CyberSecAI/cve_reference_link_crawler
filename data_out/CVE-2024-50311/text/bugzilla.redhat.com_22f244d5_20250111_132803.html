| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2319379#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-17 14:28:09 UTC  ``` Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability via GraphQL Batching was identified. The application allows multiple queries to be sent within a single request, which enables an attacker to submit a request containing thousands of aliases in one query. Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a complete denial of access to the application for legitimate users.   ``` |  |
