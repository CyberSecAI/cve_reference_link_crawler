A vulnerability has been identified in Siemens SINEC Security Monitor (All versions < V4.9.0). The affected application does not properly validate user input to the ```ssmctl-client``` command.
This could allow an authenticated, lowly privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying OS.
