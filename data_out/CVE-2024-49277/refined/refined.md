- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The UltraAddons Elementor Lite plugin (<= 1.1.8) for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts, redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. When a user visits the site, the injected scripts are executed.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into the website through a vulnerable input field or parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable input field or parameter. The required user privilege for exploitation is "Author".
