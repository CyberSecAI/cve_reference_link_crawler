## DATAGERRY is an Open Source CMDB & Asset Management Tool, which completely leaves the definition of a data model to the user

# Key Facts

### Define your own data model

Every IT environment has its individual structure. That is why DATAGERRY does not come with predefined object types (e.g. router, server, location). With DATAGERRY you have the freedom to simply define the data model for your own.

### Automate your IT

We don’t want you to just store your assets in DATAGERRY, we want you to enable a flexible usage of your data. So, access your data with one of our powerful APIs, or trigger an event-driven synchronization with your external tools (like Monitoring, Ticket System, Config Management, etc) and use DATAGERRY as a database for automating your IT.

### Open Source

We love Open Source software. DATAGERRY is free and licensed under the AGPLv3. Just download, copy, use or change it. If you need help we offer trainings, consulting, custom development and support contracts with a fair pricing policy. Do not hesitate to contact us.

## WHAT IS A CMDB?

A CMDB is a database which includes all informations about objects (i.e. servers, routers, locations, maintenance contracts), that are required for operating an IT infrastructure. Also the relationships between objects are stored (i.e. server a is placed on location b). Available solutions tend to be shipped with predefined object types, that often can only be customized with big efforts.
DATAGERRY is an enterprise-grade Open Source CMDB, where object types can be completely defined by the user and can be adapted at runtime. The stored data can be used in different ways, i.e. for automated export to external systems, an intelligent search within the data, or a reporting. All functions are implemented with the generic and the custom definition of object types in mind. With a plugin system, DATAGERRY can be extended easily – also by experienced users.

## USE CASE

Automate your IT with DATAGERRY:

![](https://datagerry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Grafik_Datagerry_Eng.png)

Use DATAGERRY as a central database for automating your IT environment. DATAGERRY can store all the information you need for your operating and push that information to external systems like DNS, ticket system, config management (e.g. Ansible), monitoring system and many more. A push to an external system can be triggered event based, when objects are added, updated or deleted in DATAGERRY.

## FUNCTIONALITY

* Object Handling
* File Import & Export
* Exportd – Eventbased Export to external systems
* APIs
* …and many many more on the roadmap

## Object Handling

Object handling is the base of DATAGERRY.  Start defining your object types (like servers, routers, etc) with a webbased wizard. An object type consists of multiple fields with a defined datatype (e.g. text, date, reference to another object, checkbox, textarea, …).
Object types can be changed at any time.
For a defined type, objects can be added, changed or deleted. Objects are version controlled and each change will be tracked with timestamp and username.  A fast and powerful search will quickly find the proper object.

## File Import & Export

Object Types can be imported and exported to and from a JSON file. For the import and export of objects we currently support the following file formats:

* CSV
* XLSX
* XML
* JSON

## Exportd – Eventbased Export to external systems

Exportd is a way to export CMDB objects to external systems. These systems could be monitoring systems, ticket systems, DNS servers, and many more. External systems will be addressed with a plugin system.
Export Jobs can be triggered manually, event-based on added/updated/deleted objects or time based with a cron based syntax

## API

APIs are very important for an Asset Management tool. Currently we provide the following APIs for extending/integrating DATAGERRY:

* REST API
* Plugin System for Exportd and Authentication Plugins

## …and many more functionalities on the roadmap

We just started with DATAGERRY and have lots and lots of features on our roadmap. Stay tuned and connected with our newsletter and we keep you updated.
