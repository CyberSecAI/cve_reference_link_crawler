The provided content details two vulnerabilities in `cute_png v1.05`: a heap-buffer-overflow and a double-free heap memory corruption.

**Heap-buffer-overflow:**
*   **Root Cause:** A read access out-of-bounds in the `cp_stored` function at line 543 of `cute_png.h`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to a `memcpy` operation reading beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PNG files (like those used in fuzzing) can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious PNG file as input to the affected application.

**Double-free heap memory corruption:**
*   **Root Cause:** Occurs in the `cp_load_png_mem` function at line 1194 of `cute_png.h`. Triggered by a specific crafted PNG file (`sample10.png`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Double-free heap memory corruption, leading to use-after-free condition.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Specific crafted PNG files (like `sample10.png`) can trigger the vulnerability when loaded.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious PNG file to the affected application.

The provided content includes:
*   A detailed description of the vulnerabilities and their root cause.
*   The affected version: `cute_png v1.05`.
*   Reproduction steps using a sample `poc_demo` and `make` command.
*   AddressSanitizer output showing the heap-buffer-overflow.
*   Screenshots related to both issues.
*   The `sample10.png` file, which triggers the double-free.
