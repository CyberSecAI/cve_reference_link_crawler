### @jdorn **[jdorn](/jdorn)** commented [Aug 29, 2022](#issue-1354891528)

If a user fails to set NODE\_ENV=production, our built-in security checks are disabled and it's possible to misconfigure GrowthBook and leave the file upload API endpoint open to attack.

To be affected, ALL of the following must be true

1. Self-hosted (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected)
2. GrowthBook API exposed to the internet
3. Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
4. NODE\_ENV set to a non-production value
5. JWT\_SECRET set to the default "dev" string

To solve these security vulnerabilities, this PR makes 3 changes:

1. Add more protection around the fileUpload API endpoint (protect against directory traversal, etc.)
2. Only disable built-in security checks if the domain is still `localhost` (in case someone forgets to update NODE\_ENV)
3. Add an extra sanity check to the first-time register API endpoint

What should you do if you are potentially affected:

* **Update to the latest GrowthBook version**
* Make sure `NODE_ENV` is set to "production"
* Set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Account creation and file upload vulnerability in self-hosted GrowthBook

High

[jdorn](/jdorn)
published
GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r
Aug 30, 2022

## Package

docker

growthbook/growthbook
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<2022-08-29

## Patched versions

2022-08-29

## Description

### Impact

With some self-hosted configurations, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container.

To be affected, ALL of the following must be true

* Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected)
* Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
* NODE\_ENV set to a non-production value
* JWT\_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like "dev"

### Patches

Patched in commit [1a5edff](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264) (2022-08-29)

### Workarounds

Set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string (as recommended in the [docs](https://docs.growthbook.io/self-host/config#production-settings)). This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.
