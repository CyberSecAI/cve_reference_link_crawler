Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload handling and insufficient security checks in self-hosted GrowthBook deployments when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is not set to "production". Specifically, security checks are disabled when the `NODE_ENV` is not production and the domain is not localhost, allowing for potential exploitation of the file upload API. Additionally, the use of the default "dev" string for `JWT_SECRET` makes the system more vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure File Upload:** The file upload API endpoint lacked proper protection against directory traversal.
2.  **Conditional Security Checks:** Security checks were disabled when `NODE_ENV` was not set to "production" and the domain was not localhost.
3.  **Default JWT Secret:** The use of a default `JWT_SECRET` ("dev") made the system susceptible to unauthorized access.
4. **Unprotected first-time register API:** The first-time register API endpoint lacked sufficient security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to:

1.  **Register new accounts:** Attackers could bypass the intended access controls and create new user accounts.
2.  **Upload arbitrary files:** Attackers could upload malicious files to arbitrary directories within the container.
3.  **Execute arbitrary code:** By uploading a malicious script (e.g., a Python script) to specific locations, attackers could execute arbitrary code within the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Network Access:** The GrowthBook API must be exposed to the internet.
2.  **File Upload API:** Exploiting the file upload API endpoint with a crafted file path.
3.  **First-time registration API:** Exploiting the first-time register API endpoint to create new user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the GrowthBook API.
2.  **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable file upload endpoint, or the vulnerable first-time register API endpoint, and how to exploit it.
3. **Specific Environment Conditions:** The self-hosted instance must meet the following conditions to be vulnerable
     * Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
     * `NODE_ENV` set to a non-production value.
     * `JWT_SECRET` set to an easily guessable string like "dev".

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to self-hosted instances of GrowthBook, not the GrowthBook Cloud service.
*   The fix involves adding more robust protection to the file upload API, limiting the disabling of security checks to only when the domain is "localhost", and adding extra sanity checks to the first-time register API endpoint.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in commit `1a5edff` and the fix was delivered through pull request #487.
* The vulnerability has a high severity rating.
* The weakness is related to CWE-24, Improper Input Handling.
