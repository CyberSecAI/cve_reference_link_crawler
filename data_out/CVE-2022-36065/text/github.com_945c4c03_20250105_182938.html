# Account creation and file upload vulnerability in self-hosted GrowthBook

High

[jdorn](/jdorn)
published
GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r
Aug 30, 2022

## Package

docker

growthbook/growthbook
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<2022-08-29

## Patched versions

2022-08-29

## Description

### Impact

With some self-hosted configurations, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container.

To be affected, ALL of the following must be true

* Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected)
* Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
* NODE\_ENV set to a non-production value
* JWT\_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like "dev"

### Patches

Patched in commit [1a5edff](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264) (2022-08-29)

### Workarounds

Set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string (as recommended in the [docs](https://docs.growthbook.io/self-host/config#production-settings)). This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.
