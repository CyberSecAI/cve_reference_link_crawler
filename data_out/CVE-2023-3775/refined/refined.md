Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A Role Governing Policy (RGP) created in one Vault Enterprise namespace could be applied to requests originating from a different, non-descendant namespace. This was due to an issue in how Sentinel RGPs were being evaluated across namespaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Namespace Policy Application:** The vulnerability lies in the improper scope of RGP policies, which should be restricted to their own namespace.
- **Improper policy evaluation:** The evaluation of the Sentinel Role Governing Policies (RGP) did not correctly respect the namespace boundaries in Vault Enterprise

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Since RGPs can restrict or deny access to resources, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to block access to resources in other namespaces. The impact is limited to denial of service because RGPs cannot grant additional permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with the ability to create/modify Sentinel RGPs in one namespace could create a policy that would negatively impact resources in another non-descendant namespace.
- The attacker needs to be authorized to write to the `/sys/policies/rgp` endpoint

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have write permissions to the `/sys/policies/rgp` endpoint in a Vault Enterprise namespace.
- The attacker also needs to know the existence and location of the target resources they want to deny access to, in another namespace
- This vulnerability is specific to Vault Enterprise, and not the open-source version.
