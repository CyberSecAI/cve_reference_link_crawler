# Committed UTxOs at Commit validator and UTxOs at Initial validator can be spent arbitrarily by anyone

Critical

Unknown
published
GHSA-6x9v-7x5r-w8w6
Oct 4, 2023

## Package

hydra-plutus

## Affected versions

< 0.12.0

## Patched versions

0.12.0

## Description

### Summary

Users send the UTxOs they wish to commit into the Hydra head first to the `commit` validator, where they remain until they are either collected into the `head` validator or the protocol initialisation is aborted and the value in the committed UTxOs is returned to the users who committed them.

The `commit` validator contains a flawed check when the `ViaAbort` redeemer is used, which allows any user to spend any UTxO which is at the validator arbitrarily, meaning an attacker can steal the funds that users are trying to commit into the head validator. The intended behaviour is that the funds must be returned to the user which committed the funds and can only be performed by a participant of the head.

The `initial` validator also is similarly affected as the same flawed check is performed for the `ViaAbort` redeemer.

### Details

UTxOs at the `commit` validator can be spent with either the `ViaAbort` redeemer, used when the protocol initialisation is being aborted, or the `ViaCollectCom` redeemer, used when all the parties committed UTxOs are being collected into the `head` validator.

The `commit` validator performs a single check when the `ViaAbort` redeemer is used: check that the head ID state token is burnt. The intention of this check is that if we ensure the head state token is burnt, then the transaction must also spend an input at the head validator with the `Abort` redeemer, and the head validator will have performed the checks that the committed value is returned to the user which committed.

<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Commit.hs#L94-L97>

The check that the ST is burned is done via the `mustBurnST` function.

<https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Util.hs#L32-L42>

This function likely should only return True if the txmint field contains `headCurrencySymbol -> "HydraHeadV1" -> (-1)`, but on line 37 it returns True if no token kinds of the headCurrencySymbol are found in the txmint field, and on line 40 it returns True if some tokens kinds of headCurrencySymbol are found in the txmint field but no token named "HydraHeadV1" is found. This check currently will return True if the txmint field contains no entries.

This means the `commit` validator will execute successfully when using the `ViaAbort` redeemer without needing to burn the ST token, which means we can avoid executing the `head` validator and therefore avoid executing the checks which ensure the funds in the committed UTxOs are returned to the correct owners.

The `initial` validator also is affected as the same check using `mustBurnST` is performed for the `ViaAbort` redeemer, but the impact is lesser because there should not be significant funds at the `initial` validator. The impact for the `initial` validator is more like denial of service, because an attacker could prevent a Hydra head from being successfully created because they can abort any head which is in the process of being initialised, despite them not needing to being a participant of the head.

### PoC

Setup:

* A user has sent a UTxO to the `commit` validator.

Then, create a transaction with the properties:

* Spend a UTxO at the `commit` validator as an input, using the `ViaAbort` redeemer
* Leave the txmint field empty
* Create any output such that the preservation of value rule is maintained (for example send the funds from the UTxO at the `commit` validator to any address you choose)

### Impact

Critical

An attacker can steal any funds that user's try to commit into a Hydra head. Also, an attacker can prevent any Hydra head from being successfully opened.

It does not allow an attacker to take funds which have been successfully collected into and currently reside in the `head` validator.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
