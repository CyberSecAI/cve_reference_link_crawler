  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `mustBurnST` function in `Hydra.Contract.Util.hs` incorrectly validates the burning of the state token (ST). It returns `True` even when the ST is not actually burnt, specifically if the txmint field contains no entries or if it doesn't contain the 'HydraHeadV1' token kind.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of token burning in the `commit` and `initial` validators.",
       "Flawed logic in the `mustBurnST` function within `Hydra.Contract.Util.hs`."
    ],
    "impact": "Critical. An attacker can steal funds committed to the Hydra head by exploiting the flawed `ViaAbort` redeemer in the `commit` validator. They can also prevent the creation of new Hydra heads by exploiting the same vulnerability in the `initial` validator, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a transaction to the `commit` validator using the `ViaAbort` redeemer with an empty `txmint` field. This bypasses the ST burning check.",
