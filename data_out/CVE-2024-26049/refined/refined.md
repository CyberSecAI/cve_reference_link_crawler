- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed when other users access the affected content.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. When a user views the page with the injected script, the script executes within their browser, which can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker injects malicious script into the application. When a user views the injected content, their browser executes the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges within the application to inject the malicious script. A high privileged user needs to be tricked into viewing the injected malicious content.
