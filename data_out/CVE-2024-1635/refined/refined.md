Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-1635 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Undertow web server, specifically affecting servers that support the `wildfly-http-client` protocol.  A flaw exists in how the `WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit` handles connection closures during the HTTP upgrade to remoting. The conduit leaks connections when the `RemotingConnection` is closed by `Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener`, causing a memory leak. This leak occurs because the outer layer of connection (Undertow) doesn't notify the inner layer (remoting connection) of closures and the timeout task isn't cancelled, leading to a resource leak within `XNIO WorkerThread`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Resource Leak:** Specifically, a connection leak in the `WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit`.
- **Out-of-Memory:** Repeated opening and closing of connections (especially when closed immediately) eventually exhausts both memory and open file limits due to the resource leak.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The resource exhaustion leads to a denial of service as the server becomes unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause the server to become unresponsive and unusable.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory and file descriptor exhaustion occur on the server side.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** An attacker sends malicious requests over the network to the HTTP port of the vulnerable server.
- **Connection Manipulation:** The attack involves opening a connection using `wildfly-http-client` protocol and immediately closing it during the initial handshake/connection setup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker must have network connectivity to reach the vulnerable server's HTTP port.
- **Malicious Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted connection open/close requests.

**Summary of Relevant Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an improper handling of connections during HTTP upgrade to remoting using the `wildfly-http-client` protocol in Undertow.
- The vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion due to connection leaks, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.
- Multiple Red Hat products are affected including JBoss EAP, Red Hat Single Sign-On and OpenShift Container Platform.
- NetApp products are also affected.
- Patches and fixes for affected products have been released or are being prepared.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bugzilla entry provides a technical description of the vulnerability and refers to related upstream issues.
- Some of the documents are in Japanese but were translated for analysis.
- The NetApp document lists specific affected products from their portfolio.
