{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2024-36929",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem. These types of skbs, used for Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) with fraglists, should not be linearized. Attempting to copy or expand them using skb_copy or skb_copy_expand leads to an invalid state.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs",
      "Lack of validation/sanitization of skb type before copy/expand operations"
     ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, attempting to copy or expand a fraglist GSO skb can lead to a crash when skb_gso_segment is called later.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by passing a fraglist GSO skb to the skb_copy or skb_copy_expand functions within the Linux kernelâ€™s networking subsystem. The specific circumstances for this to occur are not detailed in the provided context, but the vulnerability exists within the core networking code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed within the Linux kernel with a specially crafted skb that is marked as SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST. The specific means to achieve this depend on the affected system and context, but exploitation requires network level access or control over some network communication.",
    "Additional details": "The fix implemented in the kernel involves adding checks in `skb_copy` and `skb_copy_expand` to reject SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs and return NULL, preventing the invalid state. This issue was introduced with commit `3a1296a38d0c` that added fraglist chaining to GRO/GSO. The fix was introduced by commit `d091e579b864fa790dd6a0cd537a22c383126681`."
