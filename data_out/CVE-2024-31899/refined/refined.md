- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to the usage of IBM Semeru Java Version 11 which has multiple vulnerabilities, and an additional vulnerability that allows disclosure of sensitive user information to authenticated users with physical access to the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist within IBM Semeru Java Version 11, and an additional vulnerability allows for sensitive user information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The identified vulnerabilities can lead to the disclosure of highly sensitive user information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated user with physical access to the device, specifically the Windows-based client application. Additionally, the underlying vulnerabilities in IBM Semeru Java Runtime could be exploited through other attack vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user and have physical access to the Windows-based client application to exploit the sensitive user information disclosure vulnerability.
