Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the report template builder of Gibbon Edu. Specifically, the `templateFileDestination` parameter in the `modules/Reports/templates_assets_components_duplicateProcess.php` endpoint is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input (`templateFileDestination` parameter) when creating or duplicating report template assets, which allows the user to manipulate the file path.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By manipulating the file path and extension, an attacker can write arbitrary files to the webroot, bypassing the intended upload directory restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a PHP file containing malicious code into the webroot, which can then be executed by accessing the uploaded file, leading to RCE.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to further compromise such as data exfiltration, denial of service or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via the web interface of Gibbon Edu.
- The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user capable of creating report templates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account with high privileges within the Gibbon Edu application, specifically, the ability to manage and create report templates.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
