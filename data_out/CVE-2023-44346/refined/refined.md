- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak
- **Attack vectors**: Network (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to convince a user to open a crafted file. The attack complexity is high (AC:H), and user interaction is required (UI:R). No privileges are needed (PR:N)
