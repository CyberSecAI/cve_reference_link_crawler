Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Thunderbird's OpenPGP implementation, using the RNP library, selects encryption subkeys. The `find_suitable_key` function in `src/lib/pgp-key.cpp` iterates through subkeys and selects the first one with the encryption-capable flag, without checking for a valid self-signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Subkey Selection:** Thunderbird's logic prioritizes the first encryption-capable subkey, regardless of its validity.
- **Lack of Validation:** The `find_suitable_key` function does not check for the validity of the subkey's self-signature before selecting it.
- **RNP Library Behavior:** The RNP library rejects the invalid subkey, preventing encryption from succeeding. Although RNP has been fixed in version 0.14.0, the fix wasn't in Thunderbird until a Thunderbird fix (bug 1673240).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can prevent a user from sending encrypted emails to a specific recipient.
- **User Confusion:** The user may not understand why encryption is failing, as the key appears valid in Thunderbird's key manager, properties, structure view.
- **Key Poisoning:**  Attackers can effectively "poison" a recipient's OpenPGP key by inserting an invalid subkey that will block the user from being able to send encrypted emails to that recipient.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted OpenPGP Key:** The attacker creates a modified OpenPGP key containing a subkey with an invalid self-signature.
- **Key Distribution:** The attacker can distribute the crafted key via email, key servers (that don't validate signatures like the SKS pool), or other means of key exchange.
- **Import by Victim:** The victim imports the crafted key into their Thunderbird keyring.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a crafted OpenPGP key.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to import the malicious key.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or have access to the victim's device.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Thunderbird due to a flaw in how it handles and selects OpenPGP subkeys, and how it integrates with the RNP library.
- The RNP library was also affected, but that has been fixed upstream, and Thunderbird was fixed in bug 1673240 which resolved CVE-2021-23991
- Importing a valid key (without the invalid subkey) will not resolve the issue, as RNP merges the key in place, and the bad subkey is still prioritized.
- The issue was fixed in Thunderbird 78.9.1.
