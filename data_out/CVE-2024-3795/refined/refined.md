Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-3795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The specific weakness lies in the improper neutralization of user-supplied input within the WBSAirback application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the `/admin/BackupTemplate` section within the `name` and `description` fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specially crafted URL to a victim.
- If the victim opens the crafted URL within the context of their authenticated session, the attacker can steal their session data.
- This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the victim's WBSAirback account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing XSS payload within the `name` or `description` fields of the `/admin/BackupTemplate` section.
- The attacker sends the malicious URL to a victim.
- When a logged-in, legitimate user accesses the crafted URL (or the page where the injected script is stored), the malicious script executes within their browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to somehow get a valid WBSAirback user to access the malicious URL. This could be through phishing, social engineering, or other means.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges to inject this attack, as the XSS vulnerability is stored.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects WBSAirback version 21.02.04.
- The vulnerability is fixed in WBSAirback version 21.05.00.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability is 4.8, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
