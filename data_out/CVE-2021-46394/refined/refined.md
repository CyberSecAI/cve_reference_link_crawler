Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Stack buffer overflow in the `formSetPPTPServer` function due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `endIp` parameter from the HTTP request is directly used in `sscanf` without proper length validation which can cause a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` with an overly long `endIp` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable function is `formSetPPTPServer`.
- The vulnerability occurs because the `sscanf` function is used to write to a stack buffer based on the `endIp` without checking its length.
- The proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to send the malicious request.
- The affected product is Tenda Router AX3, specifically version V16.03.12.10\_CN.
