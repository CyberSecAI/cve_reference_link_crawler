Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `fish` shell's `fish_git_prompt` function interacts with Git repositories. The `fish_git_prompt` function, which is included in the default prompts, executes `git` commands to display information about the current repository status in the shell prompt. Git allows per-repository configurations, which can include commands that are executed by `git`. This can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed when a user navigates into a malicious git repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Git Configuration:** The `fish` shell was not sanitizing or restricting the git configuration options that could be executed when the `fish_git_prompt` function was triggered.
*   **Implicit Execution:** The `fish_git_prompt` function automatically executes `git` commands upon entering a directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system. The attacker can achieve this by creating a malicious git repository with crafted git configuration that will execute arbitrary commands upon execution of `git` within that directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Git Repository:** An attacker creates a git repository containing malicious configuration files within the `.git` directory.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to `cd` into a directory containing the malicious git repository. This could be achieved via methods like:
    *   **Shared File Systems:**  Placing the repository in a shared location accessible to the victim user.
    *   **Archive Files:**  Distributing the malicious repository in a compressed archive file, which the victim user would unpack and then navigate to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Git Repository:** The attacker needs to be able to create a git repository with malicious configuration files
*   **Ability to Entice User:** The attacker needs a way to persuade the victim to `cd` into the directory containing the malicious git repository. This might involve social engineering or using an exploit on a shared file system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `fish` versions 3.1.0 to 3.3.1.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in `fish` version 3.4.0.
*   The fix includes changes to `fish_git_prompt` which now suppresses certain git config options by default and introduces a variable `$__fish_git_prompt_trusted_paths` to allow enabling these options for trusted paths.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by changing directory into a directory that contains a git repository with malicious configuration and was not triggered by `git clone`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Justin Steven.
*   A workaround is to remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt configuration.
