# Navigating to a compromised git repository may lead to arbitrary code exection

Moderate

published
GHSA-pj5f-6vxj-f5mq
Mar 12, 2022

## Package

fish
(C++)

## Affected versions

3.1.0-3.3.1

## Patched versions

3.4.0

## Description

### Impact

git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behaviour of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt.

If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This does not include repositories created by `git clone`.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue.

### Workarounds

Remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from your prompt.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [fish-shell/fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
* Email ridiculousfish via rf@fishshell.com
