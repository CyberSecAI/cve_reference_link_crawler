### @ridiculousfish **[ridiculousfish](/ridiculousfish)** commented [Dec 27, 2021](#issue-1088894435)

fish\_git\_prompt may run certain git commands which may invoke certain

external programs as specified `.git/config`. Prevent this by suppressing

certain git config options by default. Introduce a variable

`$__fish_git_prompt_trusted_paths` which allows these options to be

re-enabled for a directory hierarchy (possibly `/`).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Introduce a variable $\_\_fish\_git\_prompt\_trusted\_paths which allows these options to be re-enabled for a directory hierarchy (possibly /).  I do not think a configuration knob is warranted here. I don't believe these git config options (core.fsmonitor, which is an optimization, and diff.external, which renders the diff) have an influence on what fish prints, and this isn't the kind of decision we want to ask of users. |

Today, overriding diff.external shouldn't make a difference.

* Our "git diff" already uses --no-ext-diff, which has the same meaning (and takes precedence)
* "git diff-index" is a plumbing command that, by default, doesn't use external diff drivers,

  only if you add --ext-diff and --patch (without --patch it doesn't look at content changes)

| I do not think a configuration knob is warranted here. [...] core.fsmonitor, which is an optimization  OK. I wasn't sure at first -- [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/introducing-scalar/) mentions 12 vs. 1.5 seconds for `git status` -- however unless `bash.showInformativeStatus` is set we are probably *much* faster. So I think it's okay to remove the configuration until someone complains.  what about tab-completion?  Right, let's make that consistent:  ``` diff --git a/share/completions/git.fish b/share/completions/git.fish index 6c1f80e7e..8a6090bd8 100644 --- a/share/completions/git.fish +++ b/share/completions/git.fish @@ -17,7 +17,7 @@ function __fish_git      end      # Using 'command git' to avoid interactions for aliases from git to (e.g.) hub      # Using eval to expand ~ and variables specified on the commandline. -    eval command git $global_args \$saved_args 2>/dev/null +    eval command git $global_args -c core.fsmonitor= \$saved_args 2>/dev/null  end    # Print an optspec for argparse to handle git's options that are independent of any subcommand. ``` |

| Ok, you've convinced me to remove the knob. Our story can be "don't use `bash.showInformativeStatus` on watchman-backed repos" and if someone really needs this they can hack up `fish_git_prompt` themselves.  I think it's OK to leave tab completions as they are. If you are tab-completing `git` you probably have a reason, and tab-completing e.g. `git add` will run `git status` which really can benefit from watchman. |

LGTM, thanks!

(fish\_indent would make *some* of the redirections consistent (>/dev/null vs > /dev/null) but it can't see inside quotes)

> Ok, you've convinced me to remove the knob. Our story can be "don't use `bash.showInformativeStatus` on watchman-backed repos" and if someone really needs this they can hack up `fish_git_prompt` themselves.

Yeah. Going back and forth on this one. `bash.showInformativeStatus` and fsmonitor are beyond my horizon so I find it hard to empathize.

> I think it's OK to leave tab completions as they are. If you are tab-completing `git` you probably have a reason, and tab-completing e.g. `git add` will run `git status` which really can benefit from watchman.
