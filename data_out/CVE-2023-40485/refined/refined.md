The provided content is related to CVE-2023-40485.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing SKP files in Maxon Cinema 4D. Specifically, the application copies user-provided data into a fixed-length stack-based buffer without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability lies in the absence of input validation on user-supplied data length before copying it to a stack buffer. This allows for writing data past the buffer boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current Maxon Cinema 4D process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SKP files: An attacker can craft a malicious SKP file containing data exceeding the expected buffer size.
- User interaction: The user must open the malicious SKP file or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious SKP file to the victim.
- The attacker needs to induce the victim to open this file or visit a malicious page.
