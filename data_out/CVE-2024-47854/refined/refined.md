- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user input within HTTP requests. This allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts that are then reflected back to an authenticated user when they access the crafted link. The injected script can be used to execute arbitrary actions within the context of the user's session such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or performing unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request containing malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request and convince a logged-in user of the Veritas Data Insight application to execute the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to send the request. The user must be logged in for the attack to be successful.
