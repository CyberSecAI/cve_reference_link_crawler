- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IDAttend's IDWeb application version 3.1.013 allows for arbitrary file reads due to a lack of proper access controls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve any file present on the web server. This could potentially expose sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical system information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessed through network requests to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs network access to the web server hosting the application; no authentication is required.
