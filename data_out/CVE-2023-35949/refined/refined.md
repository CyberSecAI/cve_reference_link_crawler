      "vulnerability": "CVE-2023-35949 - Read faces tic_tac_toe buffer overflow",
      "description": "A single byte buffer `tic_tac_toe` is used on the stack. An unbounded format string is passed to `fscanf` to read data into this buffer. A specially-crafted .off file with multiple '#' characters will cause a stack-based buffer overflow. Additionally, a charset `fscanf` will terminate the buffer with a NULL byte, resulting in a buffer overflow even if a single '#' is present.",
