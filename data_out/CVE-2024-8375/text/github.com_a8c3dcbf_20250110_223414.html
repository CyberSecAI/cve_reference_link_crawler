| This is a **retroactive** issue for the already-fixed security vulnerability.  The Reverb Server stores Tensors represented by protos. These protos contain type information as well as a string field called “tensor\_content”. When the Reverb client communicates with the server, it unpacks these protos by turning them back into tensors.  Reverb supports the VARIANT datatype, which is supposed to represent an arbitrary object in C++. When a tensor proto of type VARIANT is unpacked, memory is first allocated to store the entire tensor, and a ctor is called on each instance. Afterwards, Reverb copies the content in `tensor_content` to the previously mentioned pre-allocated memory, which results in the bytes in `tensor_content` overwriting the vtable pointers of all the objects which were previously allocated.  Reverb exposes 2 relevant gRPC endpoints: InsertStream and SampleStream. By default, neither is authenticated and there is no authorization. The attacker can insert this stream into the server’s database, then when the client next calls SampleStream they will unpack the tensor into RAM, and when any method on that object is called (including its destructor) the attacker gains control of the Program Counter.  It was fixed in [6a0dcf4](https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25) |
