{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing 3DS files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted 3DS file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious 3DS file to the vulnerable application. User interaction is required."
