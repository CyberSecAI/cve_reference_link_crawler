- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A broken access control flaw in Kibana's alerting functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  `view-only` users of alerting can use the `run_soon` API which is not intended for them.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  `view-only` users can trigger alerting rules to run continuously, potentially affecting system availability, especially if the rules involve complex queries.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the `run_soon` API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a `view-only` user of alerting in Kibana.
