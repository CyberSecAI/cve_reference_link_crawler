Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in insufficient sanitization and filtering of user-supplied data, specifically within the `filterAttr` and `filterTags` functions of the `vendor/vinades/nukeviet/Core/Request.php` file. The code attempts to prevent XSS by removing `<script>` tags and filtering out "javascript:" and "vbscript:" keywords, but it does so with inconsistencies and incomplete coverage that can be bypassed by attackers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Inconsistent `script` Tag Removal:** The code attempts to remove `<script>` tags with both `/<\s*script([^\>]*)\>(.*)<\/script\>/isU` and `/<\s*s\s*c\s*r\s*i\s*p\s*t([^\>]*)\>(.*)<\s*\/\s*s\s*c\s*r\s*i\s*p\s*t\s*\>/isU` patterns, but only the latter pattern is used consistently, which might be a typo or oversight. The code tries to strip out script tags but its inconsistent and could be bypassed.
2.  **Bypassable Data URL Filtering:** The code attempts to check for data URLs using regular expressions, but it incorrectly checks the original `attrSubSet[1]` instead of the un-html-encoded `$value`. It was checking the attribute value before decoding/un-html-encoding it which made it possible to bypass the check by encoding the value.
3.  **Incomplete Keyword Filtering:** The `javascript` and `vbscript` keyword filtering is vulnerable because the expressions use character escaping to bypass them. For example, `j\s*a\s*v\s*a\s*s\s*c\s*r\s*i\s*p\s*t` allows for spaces within the string. This can be bypassed by different encoding.
4.  **Double Encoding Issues:** The code first replaces `"` and `&quot;` to `'`, then un-html-encodes the value. The order is important, if the value is double encoded it is possible to bypass the sanitization.
5. **Bypassable Script Tag Removal:** It seems that the script tag removal was not complete and was bypassed using different encoding.
6. **Inconsistent escaping:** While the code escapes some characters like single and double quotes, it doesn't escape other characters like backticks which can be used to bypass filters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, leading to:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected JavaScript can be executed within the user's browser when they view the affected page, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface websites, redirect to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** If the application is used within an intranet environment or has access to other resources, the injected script could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **Account Compromise:** If the vulnerable parameters are in account management sections, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to change settings of users or take over the user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The primary attack vector is user-controlled input. By injecting malicious payloads into form fields, URL parameters, or any other input that is processed by the vulnerable filtering logic, attackers can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Stored XSS:** If the injected data is stored persistently (e.g., in a database), the vulnerability can become a stored XSS, affecting all users who subsequently access the stored data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Injection Points:** The attacker needs to know the specific input fields or parameters vulnerable to injection.
*   **Ability to Inject Data:** The attacker must be able to provide data to the system (e.g. by filling out a form).
*   **Understanding of Sanitization Logic:** The attacker may need to analyze the filtering logic to craft payloads that bypass the implemented sanitization.

**Summary:**
The provided content indicates an attempt to address XSS vulnerabilities within NukeViet CMS through input sanitization functions. The identified issues such as inconsistent filtering, bypassable regex patterns, double encoding issues, and incomplete escaping indicate an ongoing struggle against XSS attacks and suggest the system is vulnerable to such attacks.

This commit specifically tries to address the vulnerabilities within the `vendor/vinades/nukeviet/Core/Request.php` file, focusing on improving the sanitization within the `filterAttr` and `filterTags` functions.
