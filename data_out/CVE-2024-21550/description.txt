SteVe is an open platform that implements different version of the OCPP protocol for Electric Vehicle charge points, acting as a central server for management of registered charge points. Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and Javascript code via WebSockets leading to persistent Cross-Site Scripting in the SteVe management interface.
