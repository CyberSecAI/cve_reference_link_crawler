Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits related to issue #1526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient validation of the `chargeBoxId` parameter extracted from the WebSocket connection URL. The system was accepting any arbitrary string as a `chargeBoxId` as long as it did not contain whitespace. This was too permissive, potentially allowing injection of unexpected or malicious data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The initial regex used for `chargeBoxId` validation was too broad. It only rejected whitespace, but allowed any other characters. This could lead to problems with data interpretation, logging, or even introduce vulnerabilities depending on how the `chargeBoxId` was later used.
*   **Lack of Character Restriction:** The initial regex, `\S+`, only checked for non-whitespace characters and not for a specific character set, which can cause issues with database integrity if special characters are used in chargeBoxId.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

While the provided information doesn't detail specific malicious outcomes, the lack of proper validation could have the following potential impacts:

*   **Data Corruption or Inconsistencies:** Unexpected characters in the `chargeBoxId` could lead to errors or inconsistencies in data storage, retrieval, and processing.
*   **System Instability:** If `chargeBoxId` was used in a way that was not intended with the special characters, it could lead to system crashes or unexpected behavior.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to create a large number of connections with unusual `chargeBoxId` values, potentially overwhelming the system.
*   **Log Pollution:** If the system attempts to process or log the invalid chargeBoxId, it could result in errors and large amount of error log, which would make it hard to find any real issues if there are any.
*   **HTML Injection:** Charge box id was not properly sanitized when displaying the value in html pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebSocket Connections:** An attacker could initiate a WebSocket connection to the `/websocket/CentralSystemService/` endpoint with a crafted URL containing a `chargeBoxId` with special characters or a pattern that is unexpected to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need to be able to establish network connections to the target system's WebSocket endpoint.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:

*   **Implementing a Blacklist:** The regex for `chargeBoxId` validation was modified to use a blacklist of characters (`[^=/()<>]*`) which disallows `=`, `/`, `(`, `)`, `<`, and `>` characters.
*   **Configuration option:** Added an option to override the default regex for charge box id validation, so that specific instances can use their own logic.
*   **Logging Errors:** An error message is now logged when an invalid `chargeBoxId` is detected.
*   **HTML encoding:** The charge box ids are now properly html encoded when displayed on HTML pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was discovered internally and not reported by external sources.
*   The fix was developed and deployed quickly.
*   There were discussions about whether the validation should be configurable and enabled by default and decided to have the new validation as default.
*   The fix was backported to other branches.
*   A separate issue was raised to address the missing HTML encoding for the charge box id.
