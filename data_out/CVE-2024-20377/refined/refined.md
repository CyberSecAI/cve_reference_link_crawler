- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco FMC Software does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The interface fails to sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed when other users interact with the affected component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface, potentially leading to the access of sensitive browser-based information and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a remote, authenticated attacker persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link containing the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco FMC Software's web-based management interface and needs to persuade a different user to click a malicious link.
