- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `gwcfg_cgi_get_manage_post_data` function reads data from a request using the provided `Content-Length` without validating it against the size of the `post_data` buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `gwcfg_cgi_get_manage_post_data` function within the `httpd` service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve command execution on the device by overflowing the buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted network packet sent to the affected `gwcfg.cgi/get*` endpoints can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a network request, and does not require prior authentication.
