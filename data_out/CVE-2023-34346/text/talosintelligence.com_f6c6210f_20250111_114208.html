# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1764

## Yifan YF325 httpd gwcfg.cgi get stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### October 11, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-34346

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the httpd gwcfg.cgi get functionality of Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108. A specially crafted network packet can lead to command execution. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Yifan YF325 v1.0\_20221108

##### PRODUCT URLS

YF325 - <https://yifanwireless.com/entry-level-wifi-router/yf325-series-gprs/3g/4g-wifi-router-with-sim-card-slot.html>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-489 - Leftover Debug Code

##### DETAILS

The Yifan YF325 is an industrial cellular router. This device is designed for M2M and IOT applications, allowing remote management, offering several VPN services and many other features.

The YF325 router provides a series of APIs. The API that manages the `gwcfg.cgi/get*` endpoints uses a specific function to parse the incoming data; this API is probably a left over debug code. This API uses the `httpd`’s `gwcfg_cgi_get_manage_post_data` function to parse the incoming data:

```
void gwcfg_cgi_get_manage_post_data(undefined4 URL_path,undefined4 client_FD,undefined4 content_length)

{
  [...]

  memset(post_data,0,0x400);
  APP_TRACE("do_get_cfg_post url:%s,len:%d\n",URL_path,content_length);
  abc_var = websGetVar(client_FD,"abc","0");
  if (abc_var != 0) {
    APP_TRACE("abc:%s\n",abc_var);
  }
  read_n = wfread(post_data,1,content_length,client_FD);                                                        [1]
  APP_TRACE("wfread ret:%d\n",read_n);
  APP_TRACE("do_get_cfg_post buf:%s\n",post_data);
  return;
}

```

The function reads, at `[1]`, the data of the request using the provided `Content-Length`. Because the content length is not checked against the length of the `post_data` static buffer, there is a stack-base buffer overflow at `[1]`. This function is reachable prior to authentication.
