- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, which allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. Specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable function, no prior authentication is needed.
