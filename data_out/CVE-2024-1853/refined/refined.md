Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1853

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `zam64.sys` and `zamguard64.sys` drivers of Zemana AntiLogger. These drivers expose an IOCTL code (`0x80002048`) that allows for arbitrary process termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Process Termination:** The IOCTL code `0x80002048` allows any process to be terminated by sending its process ID to the driver.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** While the driver attempts to prevent critical process termination, there is insufficient control over what process IDs can be targeted.
- **Missing Authorization Check:**  The code checks if a process is authorized to send IOCTLs, using IOCTL `0x80002010` to authorize the process. However, once authorized, the driver permits the process to terminate any other arbitrary process by using IOCTL code `0x80002048`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can terminate any process on the system, including critical applications or system services, leading to instability and potential system crashes.
- **Loss of Data:** Terminating applications could result in data loss if the application does not save data frequently.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to interact with the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** A local attacker with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability after they have authorized the process to use the IOCTL code.
- **Ability to send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs the capability to send IOCTL requests to the driver, by first sending a request to authorize using IOCTL `0x80002010`, then sending the IOCTL `0x80002048` with the target process ID.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Zemana AntiLogger version 2.74.204.664.
- The driver checks for critical process termination attempts but doesn't prevent termination of other arbitrary processes.
- An exploit is available.
- There is currently no patch available.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Fluid Attacks' Offensive Team.
