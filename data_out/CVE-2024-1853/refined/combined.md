## Description

Zemana AntiLogger v2.74.204.664 is vulnerable to
an Arbitrary Process Termination vulnerability by
triggering the `0x80002048` IOCTL code of the
`zam64.sys` and `zamguard64.sys` drivers.

## Vulnerability

The `0x80002048` IOCTL code of the
`zam64.sys` and `zamguard64.sys` drivers allow to kill
arbitrary processes on the system where it's installed, by
sending a process ID on the first `DWORD` of the
`lpInBuffer` parameter request call.

In order to perform calls to any IOCTL of the
`zam64.sys` and `zamguard64.sys` driver, a call to the
IOCTL `0x80002010` must be performed
with the current process ID as an authorized IOCTL process
caller:

```
if ( IoctlCode != 0x80002010 )
{
 if ( IoctlCode + 0x7FFFDFAC > 0x10
    || (CurrentStackLocation = 0x11001i64, !_bittest((const int *)&CurrentStackLocation, IoctlCode + 0x7FFFDFAC)) )
    {
    if ( (unsigned int)sub_140009BE4(CurrentStackLocation, "Main.c") && !(unsigned int)sub_140009BEC(v6, 1i64) )
    {
        v3 = 0xC0000022;
        DnsPrint_RpcZoneInfo(
        7,
        (unsigned int)"Main.c",
        0x1E2,
        (unsigned int)"DeviceIoControlHandler",
        0xC0000022,
        "ProcessID %d is not authorized to send IOCTLs ",
        v6);
        goto LABEL_79;
    }
    }
}

```

The handling decompiled code of the `0x80002048` IOCTL
starts with:

```
case 0x80002048:
    v3 = sub_14001048C(SystemBuffer);

```

The `sub_14001048C` routine calls `sub_1400133D0`:

```
__int64 __fastcall sub_14001048C(unsigned int *a1)
{
  return sub_1400133D0(*a1, a1[1], 6i64);
}

```

The `sub_1400133D0` is the vulnerable function:

```
ProcessHandle = 0i64;
v11 = 0;
v4 = 0xC0000001;
Timeout.QuadPart = 0xFFFFFFFFFF676980ui64;
if ( (unsigned int)sub_140005994((void *)pSystemBuffer, &v11) && v11 ) // [1]
{
 DnsPrint_RpcZoneInfo(
 5,
 (unsigned int)"ProcessHelper\\ProcessHelper.c",
 0x1ED,
 (unsigned int)"ZmnPhTerminateProcessById",
 0,
 "Critical process termination attempt blocked");
 return (unsigned int)v4;
}
v4 = sub_140013268(&ProcessHandle, pSystemBuffer, 1u, 1); // [2]
if ( v4 >= 0 )
{
    v4 = ZwTerminateProcess(ProcessHandle, 0);  // [3]

```

At `[1]` a check is perform to prevent critical processes
termination. At `[2]` a handle of the process passed as an ID
on the `SystemBuffer` is obtained. At `[3]` that handle is
used as a parameter of the `ZwTerminateProcess` call which
terminates the process.
