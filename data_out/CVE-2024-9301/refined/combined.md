# Advisory

###### ID: NFLX-2024-004

###### CVE: CVE-2024-9301

##### Title: Path Traversal in E2Nest

###### Release Date: 2024-09-27

###### Severity: High

###### Credit: [nathan31337](https://github.com/nathan31337)

### Overview:

Path Traversal in E2Nest

### Impact:

[nathan31337](https://github.com/nathan31337) from ZeroPath discovered an issue in E2Nest’s URL parser that allows unauthenticated users to perform Path Traversal - potentially exposing file contents residing on the target E2Nest server's file system.

All versions of E2Nest before [#16](https://github.com/Netflix/e2nest/pull/16) are impacted and should be patched.

To check if your version is impacted, refer to the `mp4_byterange_view(request, path)` function within `nest_site/nest_site/urls.py`. If `full_path` is constructed using `os.path.realpath`, your version is not impacted.

### Description:

E2Nest parses the URL path in order to open video content residing within the mp4\_root path. However, it's possible for an attacker to supply malicious payloads within the URL path in order to perform path traversal and retrieve file content for files outside of the mp4\_root path. This is due to reliance of `os.path.commonprefix` to check that the constructed path is within the intended directory, as this string-based comparison can be bypassed with certain inputs, and relative path components can escape the intended directory.

This allows attackers to retrieve sensitive contents, such as server information in `settings.py`, along with other content stored on the E2Nest server's filesystem.

### Workarounds and Fixes

This issue was fixed in [#16](https://github.com/Netflix/e2nest/pull/16). Please, update to the newest version of E2Nest. View in-repo security advisory [here](https://github.com/Netflix/e2nest/security/advisories/GHSA-p7rm-pq2x-crg9).
