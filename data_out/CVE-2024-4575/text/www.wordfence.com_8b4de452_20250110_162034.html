### Description

The LayerSlider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's ls\_search\_form shortcode in version 7.11.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
