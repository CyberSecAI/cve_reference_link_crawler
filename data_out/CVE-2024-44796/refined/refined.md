Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability reported in issue #90:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization or proper encoding of the `error_description` parameter in the `AzureRedirect.php` file. This parameter, received via a GET request, is directly echoed back into the HTML response without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it's a reflected XSS because the malicious script is part of the request and the server reflects it back to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page by crafting a specific URL with a malicious value for the `error_description` parameter. When a user visits this crafted URL, their browser executes the injected script, potentially leading to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the web page
   - Redirection to malicious websites
   - Information theft (e.g., cookies, user data)

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL. The attacker would need to entice the victim to click a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in the `error_description` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute the malicious URL. The attacker does not need any special access to the server or application. The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click the malicious link for the attack to be successful.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code is located in `auth/AzureRedirect.php`:
```php
if(isset($_GET['code'])){
    // ...
} else if (isset($_GET['error']) && isset($_GET['error_description'])) {
    echo $_GET['error_description']; // Vulnerable line
}
```
The issue occurs because the value of `$_GET['error_description']` is directly printed without sanitization or encoding using `echo`. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML and Javascript.

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) is:
`GET /auth/AzureRedirect.php?error=&error_description=<script>alert('xss')</script>`
or URL-encoded:
`GET /auth/AzureRedirect.php?error=&error_description=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E`
When this URL is accessed in a browser, the JavaScript alert box will be executed demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
