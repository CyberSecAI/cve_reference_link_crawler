# License information is public, exposing instance id and license holder details

Moderate

[oanalavinia](/oanalavinia)
published
GHSA-4hfp-m9gv-m753
Feb 21, 2024

## Package

maven

com.xwiki.licensing:application-licensing-licensor-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0

## Patched versions

1.24.2

## Description

### Impact

The licensor application includes the document `Licenses.Code.LicenseJSON` that provides information for admins regarding active licenses. This document is public and thus exposes this information publicly. The information includes the instance's id as well as first and last name and email of the license owner. This is a leak of information that isn't supposed to be public. The instance id allows associating data on the [active installs data](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Active%20Installs%202%20API/) with the concrete XWiki instance. Active installs assures that "there's no way to find who's having a given UUID" (referring to the instance id). Further, the information who the license owner is and information about the obtained licenses can be used for targeted phishing attacks. Also, while user information is normally public, email addresses might only be displayed obfuscated (depending on the configuration).

### Patches

This has been fixed in Application Licensing 1.24.2, by [d168fb8](https://github.com/xwikisas/application-licensing/commit/d168fb88fc0d121bf95e769ea21c55c00bebe5a6)

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds besides upgrading.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
