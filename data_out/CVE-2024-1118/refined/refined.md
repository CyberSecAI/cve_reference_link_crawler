Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1118

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters within the `podlove-subscribe-button` shortcode and a lack of proper sanitization in the existing SQL queries. Specifically, the `button` attribute of the shortcode is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (UNION-based):** The plugin is susceptible to SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `button` attribute of the `podlove-subscribe-button` shortcode. This is achieved because the input is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database, potentially including user credentials, configuration data, and other confidential information.
- **Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation can also allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database, leading to further compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `podlove-subscribe-button` shortcode. By crafting a malicious `button` attribute value containing SQL injection payloads, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to inject malicious shortcodes.
- **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to use shortcodes within the WordPress environment.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- **Vulnerable Plugin:** Podlove Subscribe button plugin for WordPress.
- **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.3.10.
- **Patched Version:** 1.3.11. The fix involves using `wpdb->prepare` to sanitize the input value, preventing SQL injection.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Lucio SÃ¡ from Wordfence.
- The vulnerability is a UNION-based SQL injection vulnerability.

The provided information aligns with the typical characteristics of a SQL injection vulnerability and also provides details on the vulnerable code, the fix, and how it can be exploited.
