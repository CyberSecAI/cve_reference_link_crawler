Root cause of vulnerability: Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the administrative console of IBM WebSphere Application Server.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the administrative console, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure within the context of a user's session.
Attack vectors: The vulnerability exists within the administrative console of IBM WebSphere Application Server. An attacker would need to inject malicious scripts, which would then be stored and executed when a user accesses the affected part of the console.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the administrative console. This likely requires some level of access or ability to interact with the application.
