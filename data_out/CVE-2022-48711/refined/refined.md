{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The function tipc_mon_rcv() in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module does not properly validate the number of members in a received domain record. It allows a node to receive and process domain_record structs from peer nodes to track their views of the network topology.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of input data size",
       "Potential stack overflow due to excessive member count in received domain record"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious peer could send a crafted domain record with an excessive number of members, potentially causing a stack overflow on the receiving node and leading to denial of service or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: Sending a malformed TIPC message with an oversized domain record"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a part of the TIPC network and be able to send messages to the target node."
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The patch introduces a check in `tipc_mon_rcv()` to ensure that the number of members in a received domain record does not exceed `MAX_MON_DOMAIN`. It also adds a sanity check in `tipc_link_proto_rcv()` to verify that the message data length field (read as a 32-bit value) does not exceed the maximum value for a 16-bit integer to avoid potential bit overflows.",
    "changes": [
      "Added a check in `tipc_mon_rcv()` to validate `new_member_cnt` against `MAX_MON_DOMAIN`",
       "Modified `tipc_link_proto_rcv()` to use a `u32` variable for `dlen` instead of `u16` and added a check if `dlen` exceeds `U16_MAX`.",
       "Added additional check in `tipc_link_proto_rcv()` to ensure `glen` is not larger than `dlen`."
