Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input within the `filename` argument of the `/view/bugSolve/viewData/detail.php` file. Specifically, the application constructs OS commands using this externally influenced input without proper sanitization or neutralization of special elements that could modify the intended command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands by manipulating the `filename` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored on the server.
- **Integrity:** Attackers can modify data on the server, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes.
- **Availability:** Attackers can disrupt services or take down the server by executing malicious commands that cause system crashes or resource exhaustion.
- **Full system control:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **HTTP:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to `/view/bugSolve/viewData/detail.php`, with a malicious value for the `filename` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, without needing any prior authentication.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the vulnerable parameter to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ruijie RG-UAC up to version 20240506.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available.
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
- The vulnerability is categorized under MITRE ATT&CK technique T1202.
- Publicly available google dork `inurl:view/bugSolve/viewData/detail.php` can be used to find vulnerable targets.
