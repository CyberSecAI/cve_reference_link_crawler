- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A lock was held around a call to `ice_clear_phy_tstamp` which takes a mutex, potentially leading to a deadlock.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock caused by improper locking. A spinlock was held while attempting to acquire a mutex. This resulted in a "sleeping function called from invalid context" warning.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A deadlock could freeze the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the removal of a module (`rmmod`) which leads to the cleanup of the tx timestamp tracker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the module removal which would usually require root privileges, implying local access to the system.
