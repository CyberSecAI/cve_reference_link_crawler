# --- README for Cadence ---

Cadence is a set of tools useful for audio production.

It's being developed by falkTX, using Python3 and Qt5 (and some C++ where needed).

The tools share the same base source code, so most of them look quite similar (which is intentional).

Also, lots of custom widgets were coded when needed (like pixmapdial, pixmapkeyboard, patchcanvas and systray).

They can be re-used in other projects. Contact the author if you need help on that.

## ===== DESCRIPTIONS =====

Here's a brief description of the main tools:

### [Cadence](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence)

The main app. It performs system checks, manages JACK, calls other tools and make system tweaks.

### [Cadence-JackMeter](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence-JackMeter)

Digital peak meter for JACK.

It automatically connects itself to all application JACK output ports that are also connected to the system output.

### [Cadence-JackSettings](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence-JackSettings)

Simple and easy-to-use configure dialog for jackdbus.

It can configure JACK's driver and engine parameters, and it also supports LADISH studios.

### [Cadence-Logs](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence-Logs)

Small tool that shows JACK, A2J, LASH and LADISH logs in a multi-tab window.

The logs are viewed in a text box, making it easy to browse and extract status messages using copy and paste commands.

### [Cadence-Render](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence-Render)

Tool to record (or 'render') a JACK project using jack-capture, controlled by JACK Transport.

It supports a vast number of file types and can render in both realtime and freewheel modes.

### [Cadence-XY Controller](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACadence-XYController)

Simple XY widget that sends and receives data from Jack MIDI.

It can send data through specific channels and has a MIDI Keyboard too.

### [Catarina](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACatarina)

A Patchbay test app, created while the patchcanvas module was being developed.

It allows the user to experiment with the patchbay, without using ALSA, JACK or LADISH.

You can save & load patchbay configurations too.

### [Catia](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3ACatia)

JACK Patchbay, with some neat features like A2J bridge support and JACK Transport.

It's supposed to be as simple as possible (there's Claudia for advanced things), so it can work nicely on Windows and Mac too.

Currently has ALSA-MIDI support in experimental stage (it doesn't automatically refresh the canvas when changes happen externally).

### [Claudia](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3AClaudia)

LADISH frontend; just like Catia, but focused at session management through LADISH.

It has a bit more features than the official LADISH GUI, with a nice preview of the main canvas in the bottom-left.

It also implements the 'Claudia-Launcher' add-application style for LADISH.

### [Claudia-Launcher](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio%3AApplications%3AClaudia-Launcher)

A multimedia application launcher with LADISH support.

It searches for installed packages (not binaries), and displays the respective content as a launcher.

The content is got through an hardcoded database, created and/or modified to suit the target distribution.

Currently supports Debian and ArchLinux based distros.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-04 12:09:29 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1213330](show_bug.cgi?id=1213330 "RESOLVED FIXED")  I just reported this to upstream via email:  This temporary file is used in `cadence.py` and `cadence_aloop_daemon.py`. It is used to control the starting and stopping of the aloop daemon.  - in cadence.py only the `stat()` and `unlink()` system calls are used on this   path. Special symlink attacks should not be possible. - in `cadence_aloop_daemon.py` `mknod()` is used to create this file. This   system call is pretty safe against following symlinks as well. - the content of the file is not evaluated by any of the scripts.  In `cadence_aloop_daemon.py` the use of the file is as follows:  ```     checkFile = "/tmp/.cadence-aloop-daemon.x"          [...]          # Create check file     if not os.path.exists(checkFile):         os.mknod(checkFile)          [...]          while doLoop and os.path.exists(checkFile):         [...]         sleep(1)          [...]     if os.path.exists(checkFile):         os.remove(checkFile) ```  The problems in the fixed /tmp path usage are as follows:  - if the file already exists (created by another user in the system) then the   file is used as is. This allows other users in the system to DoS the aloop   daemon, by pre-creating this file and removing it at an arbitrary time   again, to make the daemon stop. This can even be achieved by the `nobody`   user, if compromised. - (non-security) the `sleep(1)` in the main loop is inefficient (shutdown can   take up to a second without the daemon reacting). - (non-security) the fixed tmp file path makes it impossible to properly run   two instances of aloop daemon in parallel.  To control the lifetime of a process like this either a systemd user session service should be used, or if done on foot, maybe a FIFO that is select()'ed on for reading with a timeout of one second would be a better solution.  To fix the security aspect of this the file (or FIFO) should be placed in a directory that is accessible to the invoking user only like e.g. in the directory found in the `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-04 12:12:27 UTC  ``` Fixing this will quickly could be done via the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR approach. But let's wait what upstream says and does about it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c3)  Simon Lees   2023-08-07 00:58:43 UTC  ``` Its certainly worth fixing, Cadence has typically only been used for doing pro level audio, generally to be useful it needs to have some sort of low latency audio interface connected. Generally these are single user systems so an actual exploit would probably require the local user to run a compromised script so its probably a low risk low impact situation (At worst you'd loose some audio recording).   Given this has never been in SLE let me know when the embargo lifts and I can provide the fix for tumbleweed. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2023-08-07 09:46:54 UTC  ``` The upstream author quickly replied and expressed that his project is basically unmaintained and he doesn't intend to work anymore on it.  I will try to convince him to still address these two issues since they're really gross on the hand and rather simple to fix on the other hand.  I Cadence is actually unmaintained upstream and replacement tools exist then we should drop Cadence from openSUSE. The author said this about replacement tools:  > Everything else that Cadence does is now better done elsewhere. We have Carla > for the patchbay / connections stuff, NSM for the session management details, > and other tools that replace the recorder, meters etc >  > There is also "Studio Controls" from the UbuntuStudio team that does pretty > much what Cadence was meant for, so I am not yet 100% certain that I need to > even do a revision of a new Cadence-like tool. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c5)  Simon Lees   2023-08-07 11:17:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213983#c4)) > The upstream author quickly replied and expressed that his project is > basically unmaintained and he doesn't intend to work anymore on it. >  > I will try to convince him to still address these two issues since they're > really gross on the hand and rather simple to fix on the other hand. >  > I Cadence is actually unmaintained upstream and replacement tools exist then > we should drop Cadence from openSUSE.

Currently Cadence is the only sensible way to configure jack on openSUSE as more people move towards pipewire where there are other better tools but the feedback I have so far is there are certain things people still prefer jack for certain use cases. I don't think i'd consider Cadence "Mission Critical" enough that it'd be worth dropping the package if the issue wasn't fixed.

Subject: Cadence: Fixed /tmp path issues; no longer maintained by upstream
 (CVE-2023-43782, CVE-2023-43783)

Hello list,

this is a report about two fixed temporary file path issues in the Cadence [1]
tools for audio production. There are no upstream fixes available since the
upstream author considers this project as deprecated and mostly no longer
necessary. The GitHub project has consequently been archived as a response to
my report of these security issues.

Cadence is still packaged on a number of Linux distributions though (e.g.
Gentoo, openSUSE, Fedora, Arch). Our openSUSE Cadence package maintainer
informed me that there still exist some use cases for which there is no proper
replacement for Cadence yet, when using the Jack audio system [2].

This detailed report and the CVE assignments are mostly intended to make the
community aware that there are issues in Cadence and that it is no longer
maintained, thus it should be moved away from. For short term fixes I have
attached two patches that address the two issues outlined in this report.

1) CVE-2023-43782: Use of Fixed Temporary File Path in /tmp/.cadence-aloop-daemon.x
===================================================================================

This temporary file is used in `cadence.py` and `cadence_aloop_daemon.py`. It
is used to control the starting and stopping of the aloop daemon.

- in cadence.py only the `stat()` and `unlink()` system calls are used on this
  path. Symlink attacks should not be possible.
- in `cadence_aloop_daemon.py` `mknod()` is used to create this file. This
  system call is pretty safe against following symlinks as well.
- the content of the file is not evaluated by any of the scripts.

In `cadence_aloop_daemon.py` the use of the file is as follows:

```
    checkFile = "/tmp/.cadence-aloop-daemon.x"

    [...]

    # Create check file
    if not os.path.exists(checkFile):
        os.mknod(checkFile)

    [...]

    while doLoop and os.path.exists(checkFile):
        [...]
        sleep(1)

    [...]
    if os.path.exists(checkFile):
        os.remove(checkFile)
```

If the file already exists (created by another user in the system) then the
file is used as is. This allows other users in the system to perform a
denial-of-service against the aloop daemon, by pre-creating this file
and removing it at an arbitrary time again, to make the daemon stop.

2) CVE-2023-43783: Use of Fixed Temporary File Path in /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg
================================================================================

This file is used if Wine is installed on the system and when the Wine ASIO
related settings are changed and applied in the Cadence GUI dialog. In
Cadence.py the following code deals with it:

```
    if "wineasio" in self.settings_changed_types:
        REGFILE  = 'REGEDIT4\n'
        REGFILE += '\n'
        REGFILE += '[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineASIO]\n'
        REGFILE += '"Autostart server"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_autostart.isChecked() else 0)
        REGFILE += '"Connect to hardware"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_hw.isChecked() else 0)
        REGFILE += '"Fixed buffersize"=dword:0000000%i\n' % int(1 if self.cb_wineasio_fixed_bsize.isChecked() else 0)
        REGFILE += '"Number of inputs"=dword:000000%s\n' % smartHex(self.sb_wineasio_ins.value(), 2)
        REGFILE += '"Number of outputs"=dword:000000%s\n' % smartHex(self.sb_wineasio_outs.value(), 2)
        REGFILE += '"Preferred buffersize"=dword:0000%s\n' % smartHex(int(self.cb_wineasio_bsizes.currentText()), 4)

        writeFile = open("/tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg", "w")
        writeFile.write(REGFILE)
        writeFile.close()

        os.system("regedit /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg")
```

Without the Linux kernel's symlink protection (`fs.protected_symlinks` sysctl)
this would allow other users to stage a symlink attack. Thus other users could
point /tmp/cadence-wineasio.reg to a compromised file, or have the user
running Cadence create this file in an arbitrary location.

Without the Linux kernel's regular file protection (`fs.protected_regular`
sysctl) this would allow other users to place an attacker controlled
world-writable file in this location. By winning a race condition (waiting for
Cadence to write its desired content and then quickly replacing the file's
content again) the attacker can cause arbitrary data to be passed to
`regedit`. Since the Wine registry controls ample application behaviour this
can be considered a local arbitrary code execution.

Luckily most modern Linux distributions have the kernel protections mentioned
above enabled which means that the worst case will not happen. Even with these
protection mechanisms the following problems remain:

- Cadence can be prevented from saving Wine ASIO settings by pre-creating this
  file.
- The file is created world-readable by Cadence, thus the content of the file
  can leak to other user contexts on the system. Luckily the data that is
  written there is not sensitive at the moment.

3) Affectedness and Patches
===========================

These two fixed tmp file paths have been around in Cadence since commits in
2012, all upstream version tags since version 0.9.0 contain them.

The attached patches are hotfixes based on version release 0.9.2 that I
authored to allow distributors to fix these issues until ways are found to
move away from Cadence.

4) Timeline
===========

2023-08-04: I contacted the Cadence upstream author and reported the two
            vulnerabilities, offering coordinated disclosure.
            I quickly received a reply from the author stating that Cadence
            should no longer be used and that he intends to archive the
            project at some point.
2023-08-07: I replied that the tmp file issues aren't hard to fix and a
            maintenance-only release that also makes packagers aware of the
            need to move away from Cadence would be helpful.
2023-08-21: I received no more replies from the upstream author. Instead I
            found the GitHub repository archived in the meantime. Therefore I
            decided to provide custom patches for the openSUSE package.
2023-09-06: I requested CVE IDs from Mitre for the issues. I also published
            the information about the issues in our Bugzilla bug tracker.
2023-10-04: It took a longer time for Mitre to assign the CVE IDs. With all
            data available I published this report.
