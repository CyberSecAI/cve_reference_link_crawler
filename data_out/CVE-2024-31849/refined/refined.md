The provided content is related to CVE-2024-31849.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of how the embedded Jetty server and CData servlets handle requests, specifically in the way servlet mappings and security constraints are processed, and the lack of explicit session checks on some endpoints. Jetty does not reject `\` characters in URIs, which, combined with the way CData servlets process URIs, enables path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of `\` characters in URIs and flawed security constraints.
- Lack of explicit session checks on several endpoints, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain complete administrative access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (remote). An attacker can send specially crafted HTTP requests to exploit the path traversal vulnerability. The example provided shows how an attacker can use `../` to traverse directories and access sensitive files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target CData application.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The vulnerable application must be using the embedded Jetty server.
