Subject: QEMU: NULL pointer derefrence issues

   Hello,

1. CVE-2020-25741 QEMU: fdc: null pointer dereference during r/w data transfer

A null pointer dereference issue was found in the Floppy disk emulator of
QEMU. It could occur while transferring data via fdctrl_read_data(),
fdctrl_write_data() routines, if current drive has a null block pointer. A
guest may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS
scenario.

   -> <https://ruhr-uni-bochum.sciebo.de/s/NNWP2GfwzYKeKwE?path=%2Ffdc_nullptr1>
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Null pointer dereference in the Floppy Disk Controller (FDC) emulator of QEMU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The floppy disk emulator does not properly handle a null block pointer in `fdctrl_read_data()` and `fdctrl_write_data()` routines.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A guest OS can trigger a crash of the QEMU process on the host, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious guest operating system can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control of the guest OS running within the QEMU virtual machine.
