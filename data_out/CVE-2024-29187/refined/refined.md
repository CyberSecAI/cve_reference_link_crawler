  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Burn (WiX bootstrapper) uses the insecure `C:\\Windows\\Temp` directory to extract and execute binaries when running with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of an insecure temporary directory with insufficient access control, allowing low-privilege users to manipulate files.",
      "Lack of proper protection for the working folder used by Burn when running elevated."
     ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user can perform a binary hijack by placing a malicious file with the same name as a legitimate one, resulting in arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local. A low privileged user can monitor the `C:\\Windows\\Temp` directory and replace the binaries to be executed by Burn.",
    "required_capabilities": "A low-privileged user needs to have write access to `C:\\Windows\\Temp` and the ability to monitor this folder for changes."
