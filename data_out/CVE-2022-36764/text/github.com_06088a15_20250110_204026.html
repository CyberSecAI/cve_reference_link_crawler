# Heap Buffer Overflow in Tcg2MeasurePeImage()

High

## Description

### Summary

An integer overflow can happen when calculating the EventSize variable at line 420 at `SecurityPkg/Library/DxeTpm2MeasureBootLib/DxeTpm2MeasureBootLib.c`, which leads to a heap-buffer overflow shortly after at line 459.

This vulnerability was originally reported at <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4118>.

### Details

The `Tcg2MeasurePeImage()` function, which as stated in code comments receives untrusted input, calls to `GetDevicePathSize()` to get the size (uint32) of the “FilePath”:

```
FilePathSize = (UINT32)GetDevicePathSize (FilePath);

```

This size is later used for computing the `EventSize` which is then used for performing an allocation:

```
EventSize = sizeof (*ImageLoad) - sizeof (ImageLoad->DevicePath) + FilePathSize;
EventPtr  = AllocateZeroPool (EventSize + sizeof (EFI_TCG2_EVENT)
                 - sizeof (Tcg2Event->Event));
 if (EventPtr == NULL) {
   return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;
 }
// (...)

```

Between the call to `GetDevicePathSize()` and the allocation no checks are performed on `EventSize`, which means that the allocation size can overflow, and `AllocateZeroPool()` can return a very small allocation for a very big `FilePathSize`.

Later on the code `FilePathSize` is used again for copying memory into the allocated buffer, also without further checks on `FilePathSize`:

```
CopyMem (ImageLoad->DevicePath, FilePath, FilePathSize);

```

This means, the responsibility for checking that the `EventSize` variable doesn’t overflow when `FilePathSize` is added, is on the `GetDevicePathSize()` function.

`GetDevicePathSize()` calls `IsDevicePathValid()` which does the following:

* Sets the `MaxSize` variable (max value we can return) to `MAX_UINTN`.
* In a loop we sum up the size of the nodes and check that we don’t exceed the limit, which is not a problem because the limit is high enough. Also, even if the limit was `MAX_UINT32` we could still exploit this, because we don’t have to exceed `MaxSize - END_DEVICE_PATH_LENGTH` (4), and in `Tcg2MeasurePeImage()` we calculate `EventSize` by doing: `sizeof (*ImageLoad) - sizeof (ImageLoad->DevicePath) + FilePathSize` which is `0x24 - 4 + FilePathSize`, so `GetDevicePathSize()` could return up to 0xfffffffb which is more than enough for overflowing.
* Finally, near the end of the loop it checks that we don’t exceed the maximum amount of nodes by checking the `PcdMaximumDevicePathNodeCount` PCD, and in case is set to zero it skips this check.

So the return value from `GetDevicePathSize()` should be checked to ensure that it will not overflow when calculating the size for the allocation.

### Impact

An attacker could use this heap-buffer overflow to achieve arbitrary code execution in the DXE phase in a number of ways:

1. Corrupting PREV-NEXT pointers of an object in the heap to setup an unlink() attack. By default all memory is RWX, so this primitive could be very powerful as could allow an attacker to overwrite code from UEFI applications, or pointers from the BootServices table.
2. Using the heap-buffer overflow itself to overwrite UEFI application code.

### Mitigation release plan

Patch files are available now via <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4118>. Patch will be integrated for the Feb 2024 EDK2 release.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
