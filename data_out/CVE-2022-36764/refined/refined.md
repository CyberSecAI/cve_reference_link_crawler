Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `Tcg2MeasurePeImage()` function within the EDK2 firmware. Specifically, the calculation of the `EventSize` variable at line 420 of `SecurityPkg/Library/DxeTpm2MeasureBootLib/DxeTpm2MeasureBootLib.c` can result in an integer overflow. This overflow happens due to the `FilePathSize`, which is retrieved by `GetDevicePathSize()` not being checked for potential overflow. The resulting `EventSize` is smaller than the actual size needed for subsequent operations causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-680):** The integer overflow in `EventSize` calculation leads to allocating an insufficient buffer. A subsequent memory copy operation using the original, larger `FilePathSize` then overflows this allocated heap buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the size returned by `GetDevicePathSize()` before using it in the calculation of `EventSize`, nor does it check for overflow on the `EventSize` variable itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap buffer overflow can be exploited to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the DXE phase of the UEFI firmware.
- **Heap Corruption:** By corrupting PREV-NEXT pointers of objects on the heap, an attacker could set up an unlink attack, gaining a powerful primitive to overwrite code in UEFI applications or modify pointers in the BootServices table.
- **Code Overwrite:** The overflow could be directly used to overwrite portions of UEFI application code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a maliciously crafted device path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges to trigger this vulnerability, as the `Tcg2MeasurePeImage` is called with untrusted input, and no special privileges are needed.
- The attacker must have the ability to control the size of the device path passed to `Tcg2MeasurePeImage()`.
