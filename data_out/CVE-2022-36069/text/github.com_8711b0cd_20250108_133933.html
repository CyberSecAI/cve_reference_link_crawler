* Fixed the detection of the system environment when the setting `virtualenvs.create` is deactivated. ([#4507](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/4507))
* Fixed an issue where unsafe parameters could be passed to `git` commands. ([python-poetry/poetry-core#203](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/203))
