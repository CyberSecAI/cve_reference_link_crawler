## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CB (legacy) <= 0.9.4.18 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cb\_timeframes\_edit
2. Add a "timeframe" and for the field "Timeframe Title" enter the PoC: `"><script>alert(2)</script>
3. Save and see the XSS
Note: The XSS will trigger in other places throughout the admin interface where the timeframe is displayed.

### Affects Plugins
