Here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the provided content regarding CVE-2022-31520:

**CVE-2022-31520**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of the Flask `send_file` function within the Luxas98/logstash-management-api repository.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is an **absolute path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22)**. The `send_file` function is used without proper sanitization of input paths, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path to be read by the server.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in an attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server's file system which can be confidential code, configurations or other system files. 
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specially crafted request over the network to trigger the path traversal.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application and specify an absolute path as a parameter. No user interaction or specific privileges are required.
