Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4931:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `heartbeat_received()` function of the BackupWordPress plugin. This function is triggered by the WordPress heartbeat mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
