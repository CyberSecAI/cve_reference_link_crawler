The provided content is related to CVE-2023-50015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Grandstream IP phone web application's failure to properly validate the privilege level associated with a session token. The application relies on the `session-role` attribute received in the cookie during login, without proper verification against the actual privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-269):** The system fails to enforce the correct privileges based on the session role, allowing a user with lower privileges to access functions intended for administrators.
- **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250):** The application does not sufficiently check and enforce the required privileges before executing sensitive operations.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with `end-user` credentials can manipulate the `session-role` cookie to `admin`, effectively gaining full control over the device. This allows them to perform privileged actions, such as adding SSH keys or potentially modifying the device configuration and compromising the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker needs access to the device's web interface.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the `session-role` cookie in subsequent requests to the web application after obtaining valid `end-user` credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires valid `end-user` credentials for the Grandstream IP phone.
- The attacker must be on the same network as the device, or have network access to it.
- The attacker needs the ability to modify HTTP requests/cookies.
