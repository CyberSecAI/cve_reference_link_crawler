- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges, such as an admin, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they interact with the survey. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the plugin settings and insert the malicious script into the input fields where questions are asked.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as admin access to the WordPress dashboard.
