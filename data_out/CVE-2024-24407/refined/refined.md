Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `delete-resident.php` endpoint. Specifically, the `resident` parameter, which is used to identify a record to be deleted from the database, is not filtered before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `resident` parameter, which is then directly executed against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the successful retrieval of the database name using sqlmap.
*   **Website Control:** By exploiting SQL injection, attackers could potentially gain control over the website. This could include modifying, deleting, or adding data, as well as potentially gaining access to the underlying server.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to modify or delete data stored in the database, leading to data corruption and loss of integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `resident` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `delete-resident.php` endpoint. Attackers can modify this parameter to inject their malicious SQL code.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability can be triggered from the web interface by clicking the delete button for a resident, which sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Authentication (Optional):** While the description mentions logging into the system with default credentials, this is likely to access the delete functionality, and the vulnerability itself is present in the delete request and doesn't depend on a specific user login to be triggered. The attacker would need to be able to interact with the web interface to trigger the functionality.
*   **Understanding of SQL and Web Technologies:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads and how web requests are handled.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Web Requests:** The attacker should be able to capture the HTTP request and alter the vulnerable parameters to inject malicious SQL commands. Tools such as sqlmap can be used to automate the exploitation process.
