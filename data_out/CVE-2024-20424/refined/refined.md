- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of certain HTTP requests in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-78)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the Cisco FMC device as *root*. Additionally, commands can be executed on managed Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, authenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the affected device through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid credentials for a user account with at least the *Security Analyst (Read Only)* role to authenticate to the web-based management interface.
