Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists within the MySQL Server's security encryption component. Specifically, there is an issue in how MySQL handles encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Encryption Handling:** The core weakness lies in the way MySQL Server processes encryption mechanisms, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. Although stated as "low" impact, this could expose cryptographic keys or data depending on the vulnerability specifics.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Although the impact is rated as "low", successful exploitation of this issue could allow an attacker to discover sensitive data, which might be used as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is "network", meaning a remote attacker can attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **MySQL Protocol:** Exploitation would occur via the MySQL protocol, meaning the attacker would have to interact with the MySQL server using that protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without needing to authenticate to the MySQL server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable MySQL server.

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The CVE has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3, categorized as MEDIUM severity, indicating a moderate risk
*   **NetApp products:** Several NetApp products that incorporate MySQL are vulnerable and require patching. These include:
    * Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    * Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
    * OnCommand Insight
    * OnCommand Workflow Automation
    * SnapCenter

**Summary of findings:**

The vulnerability lies in the way MySQL server handles encryption. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability via the MySQL protocol to potentially achieve information disclosure.
