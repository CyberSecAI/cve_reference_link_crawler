- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Intel® Arc™ & Iris® Xe Graphics software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows authenticated users to potentially cause a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with local access to the system. The attacker must also be able to trigger the vulnerability through a user interaction.
