The provided content is related to CVE-2021-47072.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises in the Btrfs filesystem when moving an inode from one directory to another, and both the inode and its previous parent directory were logged before. Due to how the logging mechanism determines authoritative ranges for directory items and indexes, the old dentry might not be removed during log replay after a power failure, leading to inconsistencies. Specifically, the old parent directory might not be considered authoritative for the range containing the old dentry, causing it to remain after a log replay.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent state after log replay: When moving an inode, the old dentry is not properly removed during log replay, leading to the existence of multiple dentries referencing the same inode in different locations, or directories with multiple hard links.
- Insufficient range of log authority: The log is not authoritative for the range of keys that include the old directory entry when a rename is performed. This prevents removal of the old dentry during log replay.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Filesystem corruption: After a power failure and log replay, the filesystem may end up with inconsistent directory structures, including directories with more than one hard link, which causes the mount operation to fail with an I/O error.
- Data integrity issues: In the case of regular files, the old and new links will both be present after a crash and replay, which violates the expected single-location of the file.

**Attack vectors:**
- File/directory move/rename operation: The vulnerability can be triggered by moving an inode between directories that were previously logged.
- Power failure: A power failure after the move and subsequent filesystem mount is required to trigger the vulnerability during log replay.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform file system operations: The attacker needs to be able to create and move files/directories.
- Ability to cause a power failure or system crash:  The attacker needs to induce a power failure or similar system crash to trigger the log replay.
- Knowledge of Btrfs logging mechanics: To maximize the likelihood of the vulnerability being triggered, an attacker would require some knowledge of how Btrfs logs and replays changes, as well as an understanding of how to cause specific key layouts that trigger the issue.
