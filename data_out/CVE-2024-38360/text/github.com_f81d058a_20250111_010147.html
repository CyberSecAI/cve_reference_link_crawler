## Commit

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

SECURITY: limit the number of characters in watched word replacements.

```
The watch words controller creation function, create_or_update_word(), doesn’t validate the size of the replacement parameter, unlike the word parameter, when creating a replace watched word. So anyone with moderator privileges can create watched words with almost unlimited characters.
```
