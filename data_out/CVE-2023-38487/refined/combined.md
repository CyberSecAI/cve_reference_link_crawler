# API allows to hide existing notes

Moderate

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-7494-7hcf-vxpg
Jul 30, 2023

## Package

hedgedoc

## Affected versions

<= 1.9.8

## Patched versions

1.9.9

## Description

### Summary

The API of HedgeDoc 1 can be used to create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes.

The affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is effectively hidden by the new one.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in [781263a](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/781263ab84255885e1fe60c7e92e2f8d611664d2)

### Details

When the freeURL feature is enabled (by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the `CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`), any user with the appropriate permissions can create a note by making a POST request to the `/new/<ALIAS>` API endpoint. The `<ALIAS>` parameter can be set to the ID of an existing note.

HedgeDoc did not verify whether the provided `<ALIAS>` value corresponds to a valid ID of an existing note and always allowed creation of the new note. When a visitor tried to access the existing note, HedgeDoc will first search for a note with a matching alias before it searches using the ID, therefore only the new note can be accessed.

### Impact

Depending on the permission settings of the HedgeDoc instance, the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires knowledge of the ID of the target note.

Attackers could use this issue to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user, e.g. by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use this issue to prevent access to the original note, causing a denial of service. No data is lost, as the original content of the affected notes is still present in the database.

### Workarounds

Disabling freeURL mode prevents the exploitation of this issue.

The impact can be limited by restricting freeURL note creation to trusted, logged-in users by enabling `requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.

### PoC

Make a POST request to `/new/<ALIAS>` with `<ALIAS>` being the ID of an existing note.

`curl https://your.hedgedoc.instance/new/<ALIAS> -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" -d "some content"`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
