Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-39836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a flaw in the DLT file parser within the COVESA DLT daemon. Specifically, when processing a crafted malicious DLT file, the parser performs a heap buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability is a one-byte heap buffer over-read. This occurs when the parser attempts to read beyond the allocated memory region when converting a malicious DLT file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly stated for the heap over-read, the advisory notes that similar vulnerabilities in the DLT parser can lead to a DoS condition. The provided ASAN output shows the program crashing due to the heap over-read.
- **Memory Corruption:** The over-read can lead to corrupted data, which could have further unknown impacts.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although only one byte is read, in theory this could leak sensitive information, depending on what is stored in the memory location read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DLT File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted DLT file. This file is designed to trigger the faulty parsing logic in the DLT daemon.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `dlt-convert` tool is used to process the malicious DLT file using the `-m` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted DLT file to the vulnerable system or application.
- **Local or Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to execute the `dlt-convert` command with the crafted file. This could be local access or through some method of remote execution if the application is exposed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of COVESA DLT daemon up to and including 2.18.8
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) includes the malicious DLT file and the corresponding ASAN output from a crashing instance of `dlt-convert`. The ASAN output pinpoints the exact location in the code `/dlt-daemon/src/shared/dlt_common.c:147:35` where the heap-buffer-over-read occurs within `dlt_print_hex_string_delim`.
- A patch has been committed to the master branch of the project, and users are advised to update.

In summary, CVE-2022-39836 is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the COVESA DLT daemon that can be triggered by providing a crafted DLT file, leading to a crash and potential information disclosure or further memory corruption.
