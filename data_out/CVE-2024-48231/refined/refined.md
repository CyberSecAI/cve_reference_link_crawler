The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48231.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `selectFields[value]` parameter, which is directly incorporated into an SQL query without filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `selectFields[value]` parameter within the `index` method of `funadmin\app\backend\controller\auth\Auth.php`.
- The `selectFields` parameter is passed to the `selectList` method in `funadmin\app\common\traits\Curd.php`.
- The `field` method in `funadmin\vendor\topthink\think-orm\src\db\BaseQuery.php` is where the unsanitized input is used to construct the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database through the vulnerable parameter.
- This allows for potential data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or control the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP GET request.
- The vulnerable parameter `selectFields[value]` is passed in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the application's web interface.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) requires the attacker to be logged in as an administrator.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in version 5.0.2 of funadmin.
- The PoC provided in the report shows how an attacker can use the `extractvalue` function to execute arbitrary SQL commands and retrieve data (in this case, the database username).
- The report also provides links to the specific source code locations of the vulnerability.
