### Description

The BackUpWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 3.13 via the hmbkp\_directory\_browse parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to traverse directories outside of the context in which the plugin should allow.
