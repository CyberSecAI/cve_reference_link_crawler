- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device's web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated remote user with high privileges.
