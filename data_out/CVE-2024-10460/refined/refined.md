Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-10460:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The origin of an external protocol handler prompt could be obscured using a data: URL within an iframe.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the browser displays the origin of external protocol handler prompts. It allows the origin to be masked.
- Specifically, the use of a `data:` URL within an `iframe` can lead to a confusing or misleading origin display for such prompts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The user might be tricked into interacting with an external protocol handler from an origin that they believe to be trustworthy, when in fact it may be malicious.
- This could lead to users unknowingly launching potentially dangerous applications or executing malicious code.
- This is a moderate security risk

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious webpage with an iframe containing a data: URL.
- When the webpage attempts to open an external protocol handler, the browser might show a misleading origin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject an iframe with a data: url into a trusted website.
- The user must interact with the malicious page and the external protocol prompt.
