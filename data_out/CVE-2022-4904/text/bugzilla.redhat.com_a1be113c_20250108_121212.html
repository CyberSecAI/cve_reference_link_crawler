| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c0)  Marian Rehak    2023-02-09 15:33:16 UTC  ``` In ares_set_sortlist, it calls config_sortlist(..., sortstr) to parse the input str and initialize a sortlist configuration. However, ares_set_sortlist has not any checks about the validity of the input str. It is very easy to create an arbitrary length stack overflow with the unchecked memcpy(ipbuf, str, q-str); and memcpy(ipbufpfx, str, q-str); statements in the config_sortlist call, which could potentially cause severe security impact in practical programs.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c1)  Marian Rehak    2023-02-17 13:15:29 UTC  ``` Created c-ares tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2170860](show_bug.cgi?id=2170860 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-4904 c-ares: buffer overflow in config_sortlist() due to missing string length check [fedora-all]")]   Created nodejs:14/nodejs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2170861](show_bug.cgi?id=2170861 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4904 nodejs:14/nodejs: c-ares: buffer overflow in config_sortlist() due to missing string length check [fedora-all]")]   Created nodejs:16/nodejs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2170862](show_bug.cgi?id=2170862 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4904 nodejs:16/nodejs: c-ares: buffer overflow in config_sortlist() due to missing string length check [fedora-all]")]   Created nodejs:18/nodejs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2170863](show_bug.cgi?id=2170863 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-4904 nodejs:18/nodejs: c-ares: buffer overflow in config_sortlist() due to missing string length check [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c3)  Marian Rehak    2023-02-17 13:51:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 2165777](show_bug.cgi?id=2165777) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-03-30 12:36:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:1533 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1533](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1533)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-04 09:48:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:1582 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1582](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1582)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-12 14:58:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2023:1742 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1742](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1742)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-12 14:59:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2023:1743 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1743](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1743)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-12 15:07:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2023:1744 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1744](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1744)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-05-09 11:46:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:2654 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:2654](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A2654)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-05-09 11:46:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2023:2655 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:2655](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A2655)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2168631#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-05-09 20:45:24 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
