Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2017-3528

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an open redirect vulnerability in the Oracle E-Business Suite. The `redirect` parameter in the specified URL allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, which is then used by the application in a redirect, potentially leading users to malicious sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application improperly validates or sanitizes the `redirect` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the destination of the redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites disguised as legitimate Oracle E-Business Suite pages to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Users could be redirected to sites hosting malware, leading to system compromise.
- **Reputation Damage:** If users are redirected to inappropriate or malicious sites, this can damage the reputation of the organization using the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL, embedding a malicious redirect target in the `redirect` parameter, and then distributes this URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL pattern `https://targetsite/OA_HTML/cabo/jsps/a.jsp?_t=fredRC&configName=&redirect=/\example.com` within the Oracle E-Business Suite.
- **Ability to Distribute the Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to send the malicious URL to the victim. This could be done via email, social media, or other forms of communication.
