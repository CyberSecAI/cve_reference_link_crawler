### @antonk52 **[antonk52](/antonk52)** commented [Feb 16, 2024](#issue-2139629797) • edited Loading

Due to typescript not being able to leave `import(filepath)` as is when compiling to commonjs target even though dynamic imports work in commonjs nodejs projects since nodejs v14 I had to use `eval` when releasing 3.1 of this package. `eval` is a bad practice and can be a source of security vulnerabilities. I could not find a way to make typescript output dynamic imports as is and not turn it into `Promise.resolve().then(() => require(filepath))`. So I decided that it would be easier to migrate to TSDOC.

* All runtime code remain the same. Except one test that had an error in it as it was comparing non existing properties.
* Exported types moved to index.d.ts which is also checked in.
* This migration also allowed to notably simplify test, lint and build setups.

Sorry, something went wrong.
