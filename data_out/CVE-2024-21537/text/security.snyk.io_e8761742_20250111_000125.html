## How to fix?

Upgrade `lilconfig` to version 3.1.1 or higher.

## Overview

[lilconfig](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lilconfig) is an A zero-dependency alternative to cosmiconfig

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to the insecure usage of `eval` in the `dynamicImport` function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing a malicious input through the `defaultLoaders` function.

## PoC

```
const { defaultLoaders } = require('lilconfig');
const maliciousInput = "'+console.log('hacked!!!')+'";
defaultLoaders[".js"](maliciousInput);

```
