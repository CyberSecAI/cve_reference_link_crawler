Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Decidim platform uses the Ransack library for filtering database collections. By default, Ransack allows filtering on all data attributes and associations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted Data Filtering:** The Ransack library's default behavior of allowing filtering on all data attributes and associations without proper restrictions is the core vulnerability. This enables unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information due to the unrestricted filtering capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate non-public data from the underlying database, such as user table data.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality, as attackers can gain access to private information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Decidim instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** No user authentication or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easily accessible.
- **Low Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, indicating that the exploit is relatively straightforward to execute.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Decidim versions 0.27.0, 0.27.1, and 0.27.2 are affected.
- **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Decidim version 0.27.3.
- **Workaround:** Disabling or unpublishing all meetings components can act as a temporary workaround.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS score of 7.5 is assigned, indicating a high severity. The base metrics are AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N which translates to: Attack Vector: Network, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: None, User Interaction: None, Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality: High, Integrity: None, Availability: None
