Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "RT Easy Builder – Advanced addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin's widgets. This means that when a user provides input, it is not properly cleaned or encoded before being displayed on a web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because malicious scripts can be injected through plugin settings and are then stored in the database. When these settings are rendered in a webpage, the stored script executes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   When a user accesses a page containing injected malicious script, the script executes in the user's browser.
*   This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's widgets. Specifically, user-supplied attributes within these widgets are not properly handled and are susceptible to XSS.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `template.php` file in `rt-easy-builder-advanced-addons-for-elementor/trunk/modules/elementor/widgets/pricing-table/template.php`, specifically around line 19 where a button link is being rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level privileges on the WordPress site to be able to modify content and inject malicious code.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerable plugin is "RT Easy Builder – Advanced addons for Elementor" and affects versions up to and including 2.3.
* There is no patch available for this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was publicly published on August 23, 2024.
