Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-41324:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default "Read Access" role in Mender Enterprise granted overly broad permissions, allowing read-only users to access device configuration data that included sensitive information, such as credentials used for cloud integrations. This access was not intended and not clearly communicated in the UI or documentation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The "Read Access" role granted access to sensitive data it shouldn't have, violating the principle of least privilege.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (secrets/credentials) stored within device configurations were exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who compromised a low-privileged user account with the default "Read Access" role could gain access to sensitive device information, such as credentials used for cloud integration, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires the attacker to have gained access to a low-privileged user account within the Mender Enterprise system with the default "Read Access" role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have compromised a low-privileged user account that has the default "Read Access" role within the Mender Enterprise system.
- No specific network position required, as access is through a compromised account.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Mender Enterprise versions 3.4.0 and 3.3.2.
- The provided text specifically states that organizations using custom roles are not affected.
