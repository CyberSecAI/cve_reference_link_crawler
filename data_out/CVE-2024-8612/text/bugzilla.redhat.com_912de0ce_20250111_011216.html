| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2313760#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-09-20 13:04:46 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in QEMU in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk and virtio-crypto devices. The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req / virtio_blk_req_complete / virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than the true size of the data which has been sent to guest.   Once virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some uninitialized data may exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an information leak.  Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/637b0aa139565cb82a7b9269e62214f87082635c>   ``` |  |
