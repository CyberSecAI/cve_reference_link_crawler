Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2017-3586:

**1. Verification:**

The Debian security advisory (DSA 3857-1) explicitly mentions **CVE-2017-3586** as a vulnerability found in the `mysql-connector-java` package. The Oracle advisory also lists CVE-2017-3586 in its MySQL section, specifically mentioning it impacts `MySQL Connectors`

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause isn't explicitly detailed in this advisory. However, since the vulnerability affects MySQL Connectors and Connector/J, it can be inferred to be related to how the Java connector handles data or performs operations related to the MySQL protocol.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `MySQL Connectors` component, specifically within the `Connector/J` sub-component.
- It's classified as a security issue that requires a patch.
- The Oracle advisory does not give explicit details on the nature of this vulnerability

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- The Debian advisory states it's a "security update", implying a risk of data compromise, denial of service, or other malicious activity.
- According to the Oracle risk matrix, exploitation of CVE-2017-3586 leads to "Low" impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- The impact is assessed as "low" for both confidentiality and integrity. This suggests the vulnerability might involve data manipulation or exposure of some details, but not complete system compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The Oracle risk matrix indicates the attack vector is "Network", and the exploit does not require authentication.
- The vulnerability is accessible through the MySQL Protocol, suggesting the issue is in how the connector interacts with a MySQL server.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be on the network and able to interact with a system using `Connector/J`.
-   No specific privileges are required on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
-   The attacker does not require any user interaction.

**Summary of Information from both sources:**
The vulnerability lies within the MySQL Connector/J component of MySQL Connectors, specifically how it handles network interactions. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by an attacker who does not require authentication.  Exploiting the vulnerability has a low impact on data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The Debian security advisory highlights that this vulnerability has been fixed in specific versions, while the Oracle advisory provides a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerable components and versions.
