RSS Feed Widget is a free WordPress plugin for rss feeds display. It is simple to use as after installation you see a menu item under settings. Easily to get started with this plugin, select image size for your feed and save changes. For more customization, you can install Chameleon and choose desired style. This plugin also provides to filter or mute words/text/sentences etc. To filter any word/text/sentence open filter tab and enter word/text/sentence as one per line.

You can also choose various image sizes for your feed like thumbnail, medium, large or post thumbnail etc. It also provides the facility of creating shortcode based pages. The shortcode tab describes that how can you create shotcode based pages. The most important and special feature is Advanced Settings.

### Description

The RSS Feed Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's rfw-youtube-videos shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
