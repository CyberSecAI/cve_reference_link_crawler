*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)**. This occurs because the `send_file` function receives an unsanitized, user-controlled filename, enabling an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server where the vulnerable Flask application is running. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, and potentially system files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the network (HTTP requests) by sending a request to an endpoint that utilizes `send_file` with a crafted filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../`) or an absolute path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring no prior access or privileges to the server, and no user interaction. The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable application.

**Common details:**

*   **Affected Function**: `flask.send_file`
*   **Vulnerability Type**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.3 (Critical) for most of the CVEs

**Remediation:**

The common remediation advised in the text, and also suggested in the linked comment from github/securitylab#669 is to:
   * Prevent the use of untrusted data in the `send_file` method.
   * Replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls or use `flask.safe_join` before calling `send_file`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content mentions that the vulnerabilities were found using CodeQL by Github.
*   Some of the repositories had no licenses, or were personal projects, making them less likely to be updated.
* There were many issues reported and closed for similar vulnerabilities related to this CVE. This implies a wide discovery and subsequent mitigation effort.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   The vulnerability arises from a common coding pattern that uses `flask.send_file` unsafely.
*   Many projects, both large and small, personal and academic are vulnerable to this type of path traversal vulnerability and it requires careful attention to the way user input is processed in conjunction with functions that deal with files.
*  Although Dependabot doesn't support alerting for this type of vulnerability, the Security Lab was able to identify many vulnerable codebases, and a number of fixes have already been implemented as a result.
