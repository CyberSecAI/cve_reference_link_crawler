{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on file editing within the admin_files.php functionality of SeaCMS 13.0. Although the system limits file extensions to HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and TXT and restricts edits to template files, it includes `/templets/admin_files.htm`. By exploiting a path traversal vulnerability (`../uploads/../4w6ryg/templets/`), an attacker can modify the content of `admin_files.htm` to inject malicious code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient file extension restrictions",
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
      "Unrestricted file modification through path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, privilege escalation, and unauthorized data access/modification.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/4w6ryg/admin_files.php?action=save`",
      "Manipulation of the `content` parameter within the POST request to inject malicious PHP code",
      "Path traversal using `../uploads/../4w6ryg/templets/` to reach target file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated to access the admin panel and must be able to send HTTP requests. They also need knowledge of the file structure to exploit path traversal."
