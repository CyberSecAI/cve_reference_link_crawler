Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2787:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The Wordfence article explicitly mentions "Happy Addons for Elementor <= 3.10.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Page Title HTML Tag" and links it to CVE-2024-2787. The provided changelog.txt also mentions "Security improvement for Page Title widget", suggesting a fix for a vulnerability in that widget, which is confirmed to be the source of this CVE by the wordfence article.  Thus the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping within the "Page Title" widget of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin.  Specifically, the "HTML Tag" setting for the Page Title widget allows users to insert arbitrary HTML, and this input is not properly sanitized when rendered on the page, allowing stored XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is stored XSS.  Malicious scripts are saved within the database when a crafted `HTML tag` is provided and are executed when the page is rendered in a user's browser.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied values for the "HTML Tag" setting, allowing malicious HTML and JavaScript.
    *   **Inadequate Output Escaping:** The plugin does not escape the user-controlled "HTML Tag" setting when outputting the title to the page, allowing browser to interpret the malicious HTML/Javascript.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a WordPress page. This script will execute when a user visits the page within the admin panel or on the frontend of the site, leading to a variety of attacks, including but not limited to:
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to impersonate authenticated users.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
        *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the page or redirecting it to another site.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack is delivered via the WordPress backend by an authenticated user of the site.
    *   The malicious code is stored in the database.
    *   The malicious code is executed on the frontend when a page containing the affected widget is rendered. It is also executed on the backend when an admin user edits the page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs a WordPress account with at least Contributor-level privileges or higher to be able to edit and add the affected widget to a page.

**Additional Details from the content:**

*   The fix is included in version 3.10.5 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by João Pedro Soares de Alcântara - Kinorth.
*   The changesets show the fix involves using `ha_escape_tags()` function when rendering the title, which is where the vulnerability was.
*   Several other widgets have had "security improvements", this is a common trend within the plugin updates.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-2787 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin. By crafting a malicious HTML Tag input for the Page Title widget, authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can inject JavaScript that can be used for malicious purposes when other users view the injected page. The root cause is a lack of sanitization and escaping. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.10.5 and higher.
