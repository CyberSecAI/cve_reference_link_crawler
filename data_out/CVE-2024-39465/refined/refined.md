The provided content relates to a fix for a double `debugfs_remove_recursive` call in the `mgb4` driver, which can lead to a kernel panic. This aligns with the vulnerability description for CVE-2024-39465, which describes a double-free vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `debugfs_remove_recursive()` function was called twice on the same debugfs structure in the `mgb4_remove` function: once before unregistering hardware monitoring device and again after freeing video input resources.
- The first call was intended to remove debugfs entries associated with the parent directory. However, since debugfs is hierarchical, the second call to `debugfs_remove_recursive` attempts to remove a directory that has already been removed, leading to a kernel panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free, specifically in the context of debugfs cleanup.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic due to the double free. This could result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the driver removal of the affected PCI device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker must be able to trigger the driver removal code path.
