I have used ACF since ~2009. The free version of ACF is banger. Manages custom fields very well. Great solution for those basic needs.
The PRO version is wonderful and includes some excellent solutions for the more robust custom field needs.

It’s unfortunate to see WordPress appropriating the ACF. This violates the principles of collaboration and respect that should guide the open-source ecosystem. It devalues ​​the hard work of independent creators and makes us rethink our support for the platform.

As a long-time user of Advanced Custom Fields, I’m incredibly disappointed to see what has happened to this once-great plugin. ACF was built by its original authors with dedication and passion for the WordPress community, embodying the true open-source spirit. But now, WordPress (or its corporate interests) has effectively stolen it from the hands of its creators.
This feels like a massive betrayal—not just to those of us who relied on ACF, but to the entire community that trusted in its original vision. Instead of supporting its continued growth through its authentic creators, WordPress has taken over, prioritizing profit and control. This move has shattered my trust in both ACF and WordPress.
It’s sad to see a powerful, community-driven tool turned into just another corporate asset. I can no longer recommend ACF, and this is a huge loss for the open-source ecosystem.

Advanced Custom Fields (the original plugin, not the one that was hijacked illegally by Automattic) is one of the best plugins out there, I think I use it on over 100 different websites, as it makes easy for the non-tech users to add repeatable custom fields to pages based on templates.
Five stars for this plugin, which I’m very happy it was returned to the original creator.
