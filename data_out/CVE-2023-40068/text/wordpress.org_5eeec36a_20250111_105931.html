## Description

Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) turns WordPress sites into a fully-fledged content management system by giving you all the tools to do more with your data.

Use the ACF plugin to take full control of your WordPress edit screens, custom field data, and more.

**Add fields on demand.**

The ACF field builder allows you to quickly and easily add fields to WP edit screens with only the click of a few buttons! Whether it’s something simple like adding an “author” field to a book review post, or something more complex like the structured data needs of an ecommerce site or marketplace, ACF makes adding fields to your content model easy.

**Add them anywhere.**

Fields can be added all over WordPress including posts, pages, users, taxonomy terms, media, comments and even custom options pages! It couldn’t be simpler to bring structure to the WordPress content creation experience.

**Show them everywhere.**

Load and display your custom field values in any theme template file with our hassle-free, developer friendly functions! Whether you need to display a single value or generate content based on a more complex query, the out-of-the-box functions of ACF make templating a dream for developers of all levels of experience.

**Any Content, Fast.**

Turning WordPress into a true content management system is not just about custom fields. Creating new custom post types and taxonomies is an essential part of building custom WordPress sites. Registering post types and taxonomies is now possible right in the ACF UI, speeding up the content modeling workflow without the need to touch code or use another plugin.

**Simply beautiful and intentionally accessible.**

For content creators and those tasked with data entry, the field user experience is as intuitive as they could desire while fitting neatly into the native WordPress experience. Accessibility standards are regularly reviewed and applied, ensuring ACF is able to empower as close to anyone as possible.

**Documentation and developer guides.**

Over 10 plus years of vibrant community contribution alongside an ongoing commitment to clear documentation means that you’ll be able to find the guidance you need to build what you want.

I have used ACF since ~2009. The free version of ACF is banger. Manages custom fields very well. Great solution for those basic needs.
The PRO version is wonderful and includes some excellent solutions for the more robust custom field needs.

It’s unfortunate to see WordPress appropriating the ACF. This violates the principles of collaboration and respect that should guide the open-source ecosystem. It devalues ​​the hard work of independent creators and makes us rethink our support for the platform.

As a long-time user of Advanced Custom Fields, I’m incredibly disappointed to see what has happened to this once-great plugin. ACF was built by its original authors with dedication and passion for the WordPress community, embodying the true open-source spirit. But now, WordPress (or its corporate interests) has effectively stolen it from the hands of its creators.
This feels like a massive betrayal—not just to those of us who relied on ACF, but to the entire community that trusted in its original vision. Instead of supporting its continued growth through its authentic creators, WordPress has taken over, prioritizing profit and control. This move has shattered my trust in both ACF and WordPress.
It’s sad to see a powerful, community-driven tool turned into just another corporate asset. I can no longer recommend ACF, and this is a huge loss for the open-source ecosystem.

Advanced Custom Fields (the original plugin, not the one that was hijacked illegally by Automattic) is one of the best plugins out there, I think I use it on over 100 different websites, as it makes easy for the non-tech users to add repeatable custom fields to pages based on templates.
Five stars for this plugin, which I’m very happy it was returned to the original creator.
