- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weakness is the presence of Stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), and requires a low privilege user (PR:L) to trigger by user interaction (UI:R) in the context of a different user which leads to a scope change (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low privileged user and needs to be able to inject malicious script that will be executed when another user interacts with it.
