The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47075.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A memory leak occurs in the `nvmet_alloc_ctrl()` function in the Linux kernel's NVMe target driver. Specifically, if the minimum controller ID (`cntlid_min`) is greater than the maximum controller ID (`cntlid_max`) of a subsystem, the code jumps to the `out_free_changed_ns_list` label without freeing the allocated `ctrl->sqs`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The allocated memory for `ctrl->sqs` is not freed when the controller ID range is invalid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering this condition can lead to a memory leak, potentially exhausting system memory and causing instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- By creating a NVMe subsystem with an invalid controller ID range, and attempting to allocate a controller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or configure NVMe subsystems and trigger controller allocation, which typically requires root or administrative privileges.
