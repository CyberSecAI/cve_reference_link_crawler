Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetRebootTimer` function of the Tenda AC8v4 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `formSetRebootTimer` function receives the `rebootTime` parameter from a POST request.
- The `sscanf` function is used to parse the `rebootTime` parameter, which is user-controlled, into two integer variables (`v3` and `v4`).
- The lack of proper bounds checking on the input to `sscanf` allows an attacker to provide an overly large string, resulting in a buffer overflow on the stack. The vulnerable code is `v1 = sscanf(a1, "%d:%d", &v3, &v4);` where `a1` is user-controlled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the router. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/goform/SetRebootTimer` endpoint.
- The `rebootTime` parameter within the POST request is the vulnerable input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
- No authentication is mentioned in the provided content, implying that the attack may be possible without prior authentication, but this needs verification against other sources for a full assessment.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda AC8v4 V16.03.34.09
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code demonstrates how to send a POST request with a crafted `rebootTime` payload to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code calls `sscanf` to parse user-controlled input, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

This information is consistent with the provided CVE description of a stack overflow in the `formSetRebootTimer` function due to lack of bounds checking.
