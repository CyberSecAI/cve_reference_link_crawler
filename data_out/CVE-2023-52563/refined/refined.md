Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the `meson_encoder_hdmi_hpd_notify` function within the Linux kernel's DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The `drm_bridge_get_edid()` function allocates memory for the EDID data, but this memory is not freed after being used. Specifically, the EDID data is retrieved and passed to `cec_notifier_set_phys_addr_from_edid()`. After that function has completed, the allocated memory is not being released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory exhaustion:** Repeated calls to the `meson_encoder_hdmi_hpd_notify` function without freeing the allocated EDID memory would result in a memory leak, potentially leading to memory exhaustion on the system. This could eventually cause system instability or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `hpd_notify` callback within the DRM subsystem. This callback is invoked when hotplug events occur on the HDMI port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger hotplug events on a system using the affected driver. This could be done by physically connecting and disconnecting an HDMI device, or possibly through a simulated event.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix is a single line that calls `kfree(edid)` to release the memory allocated by `drm_bridge_get_edid()`.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions v5.17 and later.
- The fix has been backported to multiple stable kernel branches.
