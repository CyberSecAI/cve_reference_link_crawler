Subject: Xen Security Advisory 460 v2 (CVE-2024-31145) - error handling in
 x86 IOMMU identity mapping

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2024-31145 / XSA-460
                               version 2

             error handling in x86 IOMMU identity mapping

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Wording updated. Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory
Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for
Intel VT-d or Unity Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi.  These are typically used
for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation.

Since the precise purpose of these regions is unknown, once a device
associated with such a region is active, the mappings of these regions
need to remain continuouly accessible by the device.  In the logic
establishing these mappings, error handling was flawed, resulting in
such mappings to potentially remain in place when they should have been
removed again.  Respective guests would then gain access to memory
regions which they aren't supposed to have access to.

IMPACT
======

The precise impact is system specific.  Denial of Service (DoS)
affecting the entire host or individual guests, privilege escalation,
and information leaks cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems passing PCI devices with RMRR/Unity regions through to
guests are potentially affected.

PCI devices listed in a vm.cfg file have error handling which causes `xl
create` to abort and tear down the domain, and is thus believed to be
safe.

PCI devices attached using `xl pci-attach` will result in the command
returning nonzero, but will not tear down the domain.  VMs which
continue to run after `xl pci-attach` has failed expose the
vulnerability.

For x86 Intel hardware, Xen versions 4.0 and later are affected.

For all x86 hardware, Xen versions having the XSA-378 fixes applied /
backported are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

Assigning devices using the vm.cfg file for attachment at boot avoids
the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Teddy Astie of Vates and diagnosed as a
security issue by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the respective stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
