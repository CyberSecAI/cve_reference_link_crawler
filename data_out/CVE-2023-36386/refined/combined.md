WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM Ethernet switches are used to operate reliably in electrical harsh and climatically demand-
ing environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22946

A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking
to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (--ssl-reqd on the command line orCURLOPT_USE_SSL set to
CURLUSESSL_CONTROL or CURLUSESSL_ALL withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the
server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This ﬂaw would then make curl
silently continue its operations withoutTLS contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing
possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-2068

In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identiﬁed in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances
where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command
injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was ﬁxed it was not discovered that
there are other places in the script where the ﬁle names of certiﬁcates being hashed were possibly
passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems
in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete
and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-22576

An improper authentication vulnerability exists in curl 7.33.0 to and including 7.82.0 which might allow
reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly making sure that the connection was
authenticated with the same credentials as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled protocols:
SMPTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).

Vulnerability CVE-2022-24903

Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential
heap buffer overﬂow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution.
But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is
read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer
even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer.
However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our
opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is
one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers.
Modules imtcp, imptcp, imgssapi, and imhttp are used for regular syslog message reception. It
is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is
considerably lower. Module imdiag is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs.
We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very
common. Usually, it needs to be speciﬁcally enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn
it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.

libcurl provides the CURLOPT_CERTINFO option to allow applications torequest details to be returned

Vulnerability CVE-2022-27782

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSHrelated option had been
changed that should have prohibited reuse.libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection
pool for subsequenttransfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several TLS andSSH
settings were left out from the conﬁguration match checks, making themmatch too easily.

When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local ﬁles, it makes the operation atomic
by ﬁnalizing the operation with a rename from a temporary name to the ﬁnal target ﬁle name.In that
rename operation, it might accidentally widen the permissions for the target ﬁle, leaving the updated
ﬁle accessible to more users than intended.
