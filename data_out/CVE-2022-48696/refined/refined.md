The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's regmap SPI driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `max_raw_read` and `max_raw_write` limits in the `regmap_spi` structure did not account for the size of the register address and padding transmitted over SPI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a size calculation error. The code incorrectly determined the maximum data size for SPI transfers by not subtracting the space needed for the register address and padding bytes. This can lead to exceeding the SPI message size limit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exceeding the maximum permitted SPI message size can cause undefined behavior, such as data corruption during SPI communication with the target device.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by initiating SPI transactions via the regmap interface, where the register address and padding bytes, when added to the transfer size, exceed the maximum message size permitted by the SPI device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the SPI communication using the regmap interface. This could be achieved by manipulating configurations or initiating specific SPI operations on vulnerable devices.
