A flaw was found in the freeimage library. Processing a crafted image can cause a buffer over-read of 1 byte in the read_iptc_profile function in the Source/Metadata/IPTC.cpp file because the size of the profile is not being sanitized, causing a crash in the application linked to the library, resulting in a denial of service.
