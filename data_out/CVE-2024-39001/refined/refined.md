The provided content details a prototype pollution vulnerability affecting multiple ag-grid packages. While the advisory refers to CVE-2024-38996, the comments mention CVE-2024-39001. The vulnerability details are similar across all three advisories, but the affected packages and functions differ slightly. Based on the comments associating this advisory with CVE-2024-39001, the following information applies to that CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `_.mergeDeep`, `_ModuleSupport.jsonApply`, `_ModuleSupport.setPath`, and `_Util.jsonApply` functions within the ag-grid library. These functions do not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property into the object being merged/modified, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: The functions mentioned above allow an attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`, impacting all objects that inherit from it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By modifying the prototype, an attacker can alter the behavior of objects, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior, effectively denying service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): If the application uses the polluted prototype in a way that can be manipulated, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): In some cases, it may be possible to inject malicious scripts via prototype pollution, leading to XSS attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves calling the vulnerable functions (`_.mergeDeep`, `_ModuleSupport.jsonApply`, `_ModuleSupport.setPath`, and `_Util.jsonApply`) with a crafted argument containing the `__proto__` property. The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to these functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable functions.
- The attacker needs to understand the vulnerable functions and their use in the application.

**Specific details from the three advisories:**

**Advisory 1 (ag-grid-community):**
