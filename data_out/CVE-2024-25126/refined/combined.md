This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-25126.
 Versions Affected: >= 0.4 Not affected: < 0.4 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1
 # Impact
 Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rackâ€™s media type parser to take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability.
 Impacted code will use Rackâ€™s media type parser to parse content type headers. This code will look like below:
 ``` request.media\_type
 ## OR request.media\_type\_params
 ## OR Rack::MediaType.type(content\_type) ```
 Some frameworks (including Rails) call this code internally, so upgrading is recommended!
 All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
 # Releases
 The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.
 # Workarounds
 There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.cvss\_v3: 5.3unaffected\_versions: - "< 0.4"patched\_versions: - "~> 2.2.8, >= 2.2.8.1" - ">= 3.0.9.1"related: url: - https://github.com/rack/rack/releases/tag/v3.0.9.1 - https://github.com/rack/rack/releases/tag/v2.2.8.1 - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25126 - https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-25126 - https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-25126

module Rack
  class MediaType
    SPLIT_PATTERN = %r{\s*[;,]\s*}
```

The above regexp is subject to ReDos. 50K blank characters as a prefix to the header will take over 10s to split.

### PoC

A simple HTTP request with lots of blank characters in the content-type header:

```
request["Content-Type"] = (" " * 50_000) + "a,"
```
### Impact

It's a very easy to craft ReDos. Like all ReDos the impact is debatable.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-25126

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the content type parsing
component of Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2024-25126.

Versions Affected: >= 0.4
Not affected: < 0.4
Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1

## Impact

Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rackâ€™s media type parser to
take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service
vulnerability.

Impacted code will use Rackâ€™s media type parser to parse content type headers.
This code will look like below:

```
request.media_type

## OR
request.media_type_params

## OR
Rack::MediaType.type(content_type)

```

Some frameworks (including Rails) call this code internally, so upgrading is
recommended!

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
workarounds immediately.

## Releases

The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

## Workarounds

There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

## Patches

To aid users who arenâ€™t able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 3-0-media-type.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
* 2-2-media-type.patch - Patch for 2.2 series
