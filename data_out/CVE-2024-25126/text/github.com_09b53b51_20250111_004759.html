This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-25126.
 Versions Affected: >= 0.4 Not affected: < 0.4 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1
 # Impact
 Carefully crafted content type headers can cause Rack’s media type parser to take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability.
 Impacted code will use Rack’s media type parser to parse content type headers. This code will look like below:
 ``` request.media\_type
 ## OR request.media\_type\_params
 ## OR Rack::MediaType.type(content\_type) ```
 Some frameworks (including Rails) call this code internally, so upgrading is recommended!
 All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.
 # Releases
 The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.
 # Workarounds
 There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.cvss\_v3: 5.3unaffected\_versions: - "< 0.4"patched\_versions: - "~> 2.2.8, >= 2.2.8.1" - ">= 3.0.9.1"related: url: - https://github.com/rack/rack/releases/tag/v3.0.9.1 - https://github.com/rack/rack/releases/tag/v2.2.8.1 - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25126 - https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-25126 - https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-25126
