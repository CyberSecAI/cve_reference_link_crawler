{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `CmsWebFileAdminController#save` interface. The application directly concatenates the uploaded filename and content without proper sanitization before creating a file. This allows attackers to upload arbitrary files with malicious content to the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Direct concatenation of filename and content without sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file upload leading to potential execution of malicious code.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `/admin/cmsWebFile/save` with a malicious file name and content. The attacker must be authenticated.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated (logged in) to exploit this vulnerability. They would also need to know the structure of the POST request, including the parameter names and content type."
