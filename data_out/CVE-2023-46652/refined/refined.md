Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46652:

**CVE-2023-46652: Missing permission check in lambdatest-automation Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lambdatest-automation` plugin does not perform a permission check on an HTTP endpoint, which allows unauthorized access.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check on an HTTP endpoint.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can enumerate credentials IDs of LAMBDATEST credentials stored in Jenkins. These IDs can be used in further attacks to obtain the actual credentials by leveraging other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in `lambdatest-automation` plugin versions 1.20.9 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.20.10 where an enumeration of credentials IDs requires Overall/Administer permission.
