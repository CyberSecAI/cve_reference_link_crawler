- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The username field on the LDAP login form was not sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Self Cross-site scripting (Self-XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS), although the impact is rated as "low" according to the CVSS score. It's a self-XSS, so the attacker has to be the user, and the impact is limited to that user only.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the LDAP authentication page. The attacker would need to input a malicious script into the username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user attempting to authenticate to the LDAP login.
