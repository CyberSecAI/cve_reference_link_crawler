Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in the `forget_password.php` page. Specifically, the `val-email` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or prepared statements.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection (SQLI). The application fails to sanitize or validate user inputs before using them in a database query, leading to this vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information, modify data, or potentially gain control of the database server.
* **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted payload via the `val-email` parameter of the `forget_password.php` page. This can be done by intercepting the request using a proxy like Burp Suite and injecting SQL code into the parameter.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the application and a tool like Burp Suite or `sqlmap` for exploiting the vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need prior authentication.
