Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `memcg_write_event_control` function within the Linux kernel's memory control group (memcg) subsystem. The function parses user-provided input to set up event notifications. Specifically, after parsing the event file descriptor and converting it from string to an integer, the function increments the buffer pointer by 1 to point past the space. However, it does not validate that the end of the input string has been reached and continues reading, thus potentially accessing unmapped memory or memory that has not been initialized

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read**: The code assumes that there is a null terminator at the end of user-supplied string and continues parsing the input buffer even if the end has already been reached. This could lead to reading data outside of the allocated memory, which is not initialized.
- **User-Triggerable Oops**: This leads to a kernel oops when the kernel tries to access memory that is not mapped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash**: The primary impact is a kernel oops/crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Information disclosure**: While not explicitly mentioned, accessing uninitialized memory could potentially expose sensitive kernel information, although this is not the primary vulnerability described.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local user with write access to the memcg event control interface can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted string written to the `event_control` file in a cgroup. This file can be written to with a string of the form  `<eventfd> <something>` where eventfd is a numeric file descriptor

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to interact with cgroup filesystems.
- **Write access**: The user must have write access to the specific `event_control` file of a memory cgroup.

**Additional Details**

The fix is in the `memcg_write_event_control` function and consists of these changes:
- The code now checks if `*endp` is `\0`. If this condition is true, it sets `buf` equal to `endp`, to indicate the end of string has been reached.
- If it is not `\0`, it then checks for ' ', and if that is true, it sets `buf` to `endp + 1` to continue the parsing process as designed.
- If `endp` is neither `\0` or ' ', the code now returns `-EINVAL`, avoiding the out-of-bounds read issue by stopping the parsing process.

This ensures that the kernel only attempts to read within mapped memory, preventing the crash.

The patch is applied to different files:
* `mm/memcontrol.c`
* `mm/memcontrol-v1.c`

This indicates that the issue exists in both the cgroup v1 and v2 implementations.
