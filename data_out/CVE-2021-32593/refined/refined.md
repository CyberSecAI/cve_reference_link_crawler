- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm within the Dynamic Tunnel Protocol of FortiWAN.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper cryptographic operations (CWE-327). The use of a weak algorithm allows for decryption and forgery of protocol messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can decrypt and forge protocol communication messages, leading to potential information disclosure and manipulation of the system's state.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based and can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable FortiWAN device over the network. No authentication is required.
