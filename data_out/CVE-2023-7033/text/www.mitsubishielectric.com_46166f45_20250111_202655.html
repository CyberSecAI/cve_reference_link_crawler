Mitigations / Workarounds

Mitsubishi  Electric  recommends  that  customers  take  the  following  mitigation  measures  to  minimize  the  risk  of  exploiting  this
vulnerability:

- Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), etc. to prevent unauthorized access when Internet access is required.
- Use within a LAN and block access from untrusted networks and hosts through firewalls.
- Use IP filter function*3 to block access from untrusted hosts.
- Restrict physical access to the affected products and the LAN to which they are connected.

*3: For details on the IP filter function, please refer to the following manual for each product.
"13.1 IP Filter Function" in the MELSEC iQ-F FX5 User's Manual (Communication)
