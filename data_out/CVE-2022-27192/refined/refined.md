- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Reporting module in DVS Avilys allows unauthenticated file download of any file on the server. Additionally, application log files include session tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unauthenticated arbitrary file download.
  - Inclusion of session tokens in application log files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download any file from the server. The exposed session tokens in the logs can be used to impersonate an administrator and compromise the system further.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable DVS Avilys application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required to exploit the file download vulnerability. Access to the server's file system and application logs would also be needed.
