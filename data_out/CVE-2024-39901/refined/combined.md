# [Download & Get Started](/versions/opensearch-2-14-0.html)

## Try OpenSearch with Docker Compose

The best way to try out OpenSearch is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). These steps will set up a two node cluster of OpenSearch plus OpenSearch Dashboards:

1. Set up your Docker host environment
   * **macOS & Windows**: In Docker *Preferences* > *Resources*, set RAM to at least 4 GB.
   * **Linux**: Ensure `vm.max_map_count` is set to at least 262144 as per the [documentation](/docs/opensearch/install/important-settings/).
2. Download [docker-compose.yml](/samples/docker-compose.yml) into your desired directory
   * **Note for OpenSearch 2.12 or later:**
     Fresh installs of 2.12 or later require that you define an admin password â using the `OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable â when configuring the security demo. For more information, see [Setting up a demo configuration](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/configuration/demo-configuration/).
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Have a nice coffee while everything is downloading and starting up
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:5601/](http://localhost:5601) for OpenSearch Dashboards
6. Login with the default username (`admin`) and password (`<custom-admin-password>`)

## OpenSearch

OpenSearch is a distributed search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. After adding your data to OpenSearch, you can perform full-text searches on it with all of the features you might expect: search by field, search multiple indices, boost fields, rank results by score, sort results by field, and aggregate results.

# Improper tenancy access control to observability resources

Moderate

[cwperks](/cwperks)
published
GHSA-77vc-rj32-2r33
Jul 9, 2024

## Package

OpenSearch

## Affected versions

< 2.14

## Patched versions

2.14

## Description

### Summary

An issue in the OpenSearch observability plugins allows unintended access to private tenant resources like notebooks. The system did not properly check if the user was the resource author when accessing resources in a private tenant, leading to potential data being revealed.

### Impact

The lack of proper access control validation for private tenant resources in the OpenSearch observability and reporting plugins can lead to unintended data access. If an authorized user with observability or reporting roles is aware of another user's private tenant resource ID, such as a notebook, they can potentially read, modify, or take ownership of that resource, despite not being the original author, thus impacting the confidentiality and integrity of private tenant resources. The impact is confined to private tenant resources, where authorized users may gain inappropriate visibility into data intended to be private from other users within the same OpenSearch instance, potentially violating the intended separation of access. This issue does not alter the scope of access but highlights a flaw in the existing access control mechanisms.

Impacted versions <= 2.13

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
