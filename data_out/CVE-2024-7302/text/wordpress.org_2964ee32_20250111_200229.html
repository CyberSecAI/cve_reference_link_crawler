We used the Blog2Social plugin for a few months, but the experience was far from satisfactory. The plugin is not user-friendly, complicated to configure, and we encountered frequent issues, such as failures to post automatically after publishing articles. At one point, we had to uninstall and reinstall the plugin to try and fix the problems.
Furthermore, even after uninstalling the plugin and no longer using it, we were unexpectedly charged for a renewal. When we reached out to the support team to clarify the misunderstanding and request a cancellation and refund, our requests were ignored.
We do not recommend using this plugin and consider the developer to be non-transparent about the policies for renewal and cancellation.
