{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of JP2 files, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient validation of user-provided data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted JP2 file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious JP2 file, and the victim needs to open it with the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need any special privileges, but the user must interact with the malicious content.  The attacker can be remote."
