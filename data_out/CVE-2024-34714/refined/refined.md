Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-34714

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An oversight in commit `d4e8e48` caused a critical check for the origin list to be missed. This allowed the Hoppscotch extension to process and respond to messages from origins not present in the allowed origin list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper origin validation: The extension failed to properly validate the origin of incoming messages, leading to unauthorized access to internal APIs.
- CORS bypass: The vulnerability allowed any website to bypass CORS restrictions if the user was running a vulnerable version of the extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Any website could interact with the Hoppscotch Extension's internal APIs, potentially leading to unintended actions or data exposure.
-  Bypassing CORS restrictions would mean a malicious site could potentially extract data or perform actions as if they were the allowed origin.
- Allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can be on the network to exploit the vulnerability.
- Any website that a user visits while having the vulnerable extension installed could potentially exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a website that a user with the vulnerable extension visits.
- The attacker would need to send specially crafted messages to the Hoppscotch Extension.
- Low privileges needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction required for exploitation.

**Patches:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `7e364b9`, released with extension version `0.35`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.6, categorized as High severity.
- The vulnerability impacts both Chrome and Firefox versions of the extension, prior to version 0.35.
