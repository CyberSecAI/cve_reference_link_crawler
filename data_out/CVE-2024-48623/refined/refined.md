The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48623.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `list_id` and `domain_id` parameters in `queue\index.php` are directly concatenated to `$_SESSION['s_message_danger']` without validation. This user-controlled data is then output to the frontend, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation on the `list_id` and `domain_id` GET parameters.
- Improper handling of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by a user.
- This can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
- Potential impact includes session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the web page, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL containing the exploit payload in the `list_id` or `domain_id` parameters
- The attacker would then need to induce a user to click on the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a URL containing a malicious payload in the `list_id` or `domain_id` GET parameters.
- The attacker requires the user to click on the crafted URL, which can be achieved through social engineering or other methods.
