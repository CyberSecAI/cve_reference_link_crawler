An arbitrary code execution vulnerability was reported to Rockwell Automation in Arena Simulation that could potentially allow a malicious user to commit unauthorized arbitrary code to the software by using a memory buffer overflow.  The threat-actor could then execute malicious code on the system affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.  The user would need to open a malicious file provided to them by the attacker for the code to execute.
