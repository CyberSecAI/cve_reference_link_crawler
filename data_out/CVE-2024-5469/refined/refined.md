- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing validation of data sent by agentk in the `GetConfiguration` gRPC call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation for data received from agentk. This leads to a panic and crash of KAS (GitLab Kubernetes Agent Server) when invalid data is processed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) of KAS. By sending invalid data, an attacker can crash the KAS service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious or crafted data via agentk during the `GetConfiguration` gRPC call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to interact with the KAS service through the agentk and send data to the `GetConfiguration` endpoint.
