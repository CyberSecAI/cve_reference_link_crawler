{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `formSetDeviceName` function in Tenda FH1202 V1.2.0.14(408) firmware is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formSetDeviceName` function. The user-controlled `deviceName` parameter from a POST request is used in a `sprintf` function call to copy it into a buffer (`v6`). The buffer size is not checked against the length of the user provided input, leading to overflow if `deviceName` is too large.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (by crashing the device) or potentially remote code execution if an attacker crafts a malicious payload that overwrites return addresses on the stack.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/SetOnlineDevName` endpoint, using the `deviceName` parameter with a large string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected device. This implies the attacker must have network access to the device, possibly through the local network or, in some cases, via remote access if the device is exposed."
