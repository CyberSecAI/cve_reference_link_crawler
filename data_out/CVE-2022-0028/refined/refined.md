- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A misconfiguration of PAN-OS URL filtering policy, where a URL filtering profile with blocked categories is applied to a security rule with a source zone having an external-facing network interface, allows the firewall to be misused for reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper configuration of URL filtering policies combined with the lack of specific protections. Specifically, a firewall with a URL filtering profile blocking one or more categories applied to a security rule with an external-facing source zone, without enabling either packet-based attack protection or flood protection (SYN cookies) is susceptible.

- **Impact of exploitation**: The firewall becomes an unwitting participant in a reflected DoS attack, directing a large volume of traffic at an attacker-specified target, which can lead to a denial of service for that target. The firewall's own confidentiality, integrity, and availability are not directly impacted, but the organization's reputation can be damaged.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-based, using reflected and amplified TCP traffic originating from the misconfigured firewall towards the attacker's target. The attacker does not require any authentication or user interaction.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to a firewall that is misconfigured with the specific URL filtering rules and lacks the necessary protection mechanisms. They must also be able to spoof the source IP address of their intended victim. The attacker position is external to the firewall's network.
