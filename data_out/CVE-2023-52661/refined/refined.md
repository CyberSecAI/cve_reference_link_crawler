Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a resource leak in the `tegra_dc_rgb_probe` function within the Linux kernel's DRM subsystem.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `tegra_dc_rgb_probe` function acquires a clock resource `pll_d2_out0` using `clk_get_sys()`. However, if this operation fails, the function's error handling path doesn't release the previously acquired clock resource `rgb->pll_d_out0` leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource leak: A clock resource is acquired but not released in a specific error condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Resource exhaustion: Repeated failures in acquiring `pll_d2_out0` clock will leak a clock resource on every failed attempt. This may lead to eventual resource exhaustion and potentially system instability over time.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the error condition in `tegra_dc_rgb_probe` where `clk_get_sys(..., "pll_d2_out0")` fails. This could involve manipulating hardware or software configurations to induce the failure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger the execution of `tegra_dc_rgb_probe` function
- Ability to influence the conditions under which `clk_get_sys` can fail, which likely involves hardware or driver interaction.
