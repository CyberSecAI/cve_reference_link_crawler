fix [GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh "GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh"): reflected-XSS in cookie-setters;

```
it was possible to set cookie values which contained newlines,
thus terminating the http header and bleeding into the body.

We now disallow control-characters in queries,
but still allow them in paths, as copyparty supports
filenames containing newlines and other mojibake.

The changes in `set_k304` are not necessary in fixing the vulnerability,
but makes the behavior more correct.
