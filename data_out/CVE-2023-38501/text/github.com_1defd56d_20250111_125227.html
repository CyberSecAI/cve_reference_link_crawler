# Reflected cross-site scripting via k304 parameter

Moderate

[9001](/9001)
published
GHSA-f54q-j679-p9hh
Jul 23, 2023

## Package

pip

copyparty
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.8.6

## Patched versions

1.8.7

## Description

### Summary

The application contains a reflected cross-site scripting via URL-parameter `?k304=...` and `?setck=...`

### Details

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the application that could allow an attacker to execute malicious javascript code by tricking users into accessing a malicious link.

The worst-case outcome of this is being able to move or delete existing files on the server, or upload new files, using the account of the person who clicks the malicious link.

It is recommended to change the passwords of your copyparty accounts, unless you have inspected your logs and found no trace of attacks.

### Checking for exposure

if copyparty is running behind a reverse proxy, you can check the access-logs for traces of attacks, by grepping for URLs containing `?hc=` with `<` somewhere in its value, for example using the following command:

* nginx:
  ```
  (gzip -dc access.log*.gz; cat access.log) | sed -r 's/" [0-9]+ .*//' | grep -iE '%0[da]%0[da]%0[da]%0[da]|[?&](hc|pw)=.*[<>]'
  ```

the above commands also check for attacks against [GHSA-cw7j-v52w-fp5r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cw7j-v52w-fp5r "GHSA-cw7j-v52w-fp5r")

### PoC

`https://localhost:3923/?k304=y%0D%0A%0D%0A%3Cimg+src%3Dcopyparty+onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E`

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
