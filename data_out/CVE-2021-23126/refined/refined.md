```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of the insecure `rand()` function for generating 2FA secrets and the usage of an insufficient length for the 2FA secret (10 bytes) according to RFC 4226 which recommends 20 bytes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure Randomness",
    "Insufficient Length of 2FA secret"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is low. The usage of insecure randomness makes it easier for attackers to potentially predict the 2FA secret. The insufficient length of the 2FA secret weakens the strength of the 2FA mechanism.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the generation of the 2FA secret during the 2FA setup process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be in a position to exploit the insecure random number generation, possibly through trying to brute-force or predict the generated secret. This implies that the attacker needs to be targeting the specific 2FA setup process."
