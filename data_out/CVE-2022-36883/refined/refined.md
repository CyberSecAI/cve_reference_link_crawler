The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins. Here's the breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2022-36883:

**CVE-2022-36883**
*   **Root Cause:** The Git Plugin's webhook endpoint `/git/notifyCommit` does not perform a permission check, allowing unauthorized users to trigger builds.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing permission check.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can trigger builds of jobs using a specified Git repository, even if they don't have access to those jobs. They can also cause the builds to check out an attacker-specified commit, potentially introducing malicious code. Additionally, the endpoint reveals information about the existence of jobs configured with the Git repository, including those the user has no access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a GET request to the `/git/notifyCommit` endpoint with a repository URL and an optional `sha1` parameter for a specific commit.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs knowledge of Git repository URLs and the ability to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need any specific permissions in Jenkins other than the ability to reach the affected endpoint.
