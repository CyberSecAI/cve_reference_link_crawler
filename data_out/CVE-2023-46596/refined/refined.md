- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the AlgoSec FireFlow VisualFlow workflow editor. Specifically, special HTML characters could be saved in the "Name," "Description," and "Configuration File" fields of a workflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can initiate an XSS attack by injecting malicious executable scripts into the application's code. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser session, potentially compromising the application or user data.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious HTML code and injecting it into the vulnerable fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to access and modify workflows in the AlgoSec FireFlow VisualFlow workflow editor.
