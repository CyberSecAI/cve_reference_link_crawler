Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-48653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `/ccm/calendar/dialogs/event/delete/submit` endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint was accepting GET requests without proper token validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **CSRF:** The application did not require a valid security token for the delete action, enabling an attacker to craft a malicious request that would be executed when a logged-in admin user interacts with it.
* **Predictable Event IDs:** The event IDs were described as "numeric and sequential", making it easier for an attacker to guess or enumerate valid event IDs to target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker could force an administrator to delete events from the site. This leads to a loss of data and disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that is triggered when a logged-in administrator interacts with it (e.g. by clicking a link, visiting a page with the malicious code)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the attack requires a logged-in administrator user to interact with the malicious request.
* The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/ccm/calendar/dialogs/event/delete/submit`) and the predictable event ID structure.

**Additional Information:**

* **Affected Versions:** Concrete CMS versions prior to 9.2.3 are affected.
* **CVSS Score:**  The Concrete CMS Security team scored this vulnerability as 4.3 with a CVSS v3 vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.
* **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by updating the dialog endpoint to only accept POST requests with a valid security token.
* **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by Veshraj Ghimire.
