Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded symmetric key within the `fips.c` file of FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer. This key is used to encrypt sensitive credential data of type "ENC" within the CLI configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded Cryptographic Key:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded key, making it easily discoverable and usable by an attacker.
- **Insecure Encryption of Sensitive Data:** The encryption of sensitive data relies on this single, shared hardcoded key, rendering the encryption effectively useless if the key is known.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the CLI configuration or CLI backup file can decrypt sensitive credential data to plaintext by using the hardcoded key. This includes any credentials of type "ENC" found in the configuration.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Decrypted credentials can be used for lateral movement, further attacks, or unauthorized access to resources managed by the affected FortiManager or FortiAnalyzer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CLI Configuration Access:** An attacker who obtains the CLI configuration file (e.g., through a leak, unauthorized access, or careless posting on a forum) can exploit this vulnerability.
- **CLI Backup File Access:** An attacker who gains access to an unprotected CLI backup file (not protected with password) can decrypt credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to CLI Configuration:** The attacker needs access to the CLI configuration file or a CLI backup file. This could involve a compromised administrator account or access to a publicly leaked configuration.
- **Knowledge of Hardcoded Key:** While the hardcoded key was not directly exposed in the provided text, the vulnerability relies on the attacker having knowledge of this key.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is specific to FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer devices.
- FIPS-CC devices are not impacted as the encryption method is overridden.
- The vulnerability is considered medium severity with a CVSS v3 score of 4.2
- This content also contains information about the related CVE-2019-6693 for FortiOS, which also suffered from the same vulnerability.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description which usually just says that a hardcoded encryption key is present.
