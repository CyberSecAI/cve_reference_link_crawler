## Microsoft Object Packager fails to properly display file types

#### Vulnerability Note VU#703936

Original Release Date: 2006-10-10 | Last Revised: 2006-10-10

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Object Packager fails to properly display the file types. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| According to [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/packager_what_is_obj_pkg.mspx?mfr=true):  *Object Packager is a tool you can use to create a package that you can insert into a file.* The Object Packager fails to properly display the file types of embedded objects. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-065](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-065.mspx):*An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted file and sending the file to a user on an affected system in email or by having them click on a link to receive the file. Once the file is received the user would then have to click on the embedded object within the file and accept a misleading dialogue indicating that the user is about access a different file type.* More information is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin[MS06-065](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-065.mspx). |
