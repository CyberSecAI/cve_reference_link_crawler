{
  "Vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2006-4692",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of file extensions by Object Packager when displaying embedded objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Object Packager fails to properly display the file types of embedded objects."
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can conceal the types of objects embedded within files, possibly misleading users into executing arbitrary code. Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted file sent via email.",
      "User clicking on a link to receive the specially crafted file.",
       "A specially crafted file hosted on a malicious website."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted file with a misleading embedded object and deliver this file to the targeted user. The attacker also needs to persuade the user to open the file and interact with the embedded object."
  }
