Several issues have been found in htmldoc, an HTML processor that
generates indexed HTML, PS, and PDF.
```

CVE-2022-0534

     A crafted GIF file could lead to a stack out-of-bounds read,
     which could result in a crash (segmentation fault).

CVE-2021-43579

     Converting an HTML document, which links to a crafted BMP file,
     could lead to a stack-based buffer overflow, which could result
     in remote code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
