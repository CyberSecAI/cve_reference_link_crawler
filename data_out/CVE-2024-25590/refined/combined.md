# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-04: Crafted responses can lead to a denial of service due to cache inefficiencies in the Recursor[Â¶](#powerdns-security-advisory-2024-04-crafted-responses-can-lead-to-a-denial-of-service-due-to-cache-inefficiencies-in-the-recursor "Permalink to this headline")

* CVE: CVE-2024-25590
* Date: 3rd of October 2024.
* Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.9.8, 5.0.8 and 5.1.1
* Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 4.9.9, 5.0.9 and 5.1.2
* Severity: High
* Impact: Denial of service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker publishing a crafted zone
* Risk of system compromise: None
* Solution: Upgrade to patched version

An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record Sets. Repeatedly processing and caching results for these sets can lead to a denial of service.

CVSS Score: 7.5, see
<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H&version=3.1>

The remedy is: upgrade to a patched version

We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for bringing this issue to our attention and assisting in validating the patches.

Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-04

   Hello,

   Today we have released PowerDNS Recursor 4.9.9, 5.0.9 and 5.1.2.

   These releases fix PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-04: Crafted
   responses can lead to a denial of service due to cache inefficiencies
   in the Recursor.

   PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-04: Crafted responses can lead to a denial of
   service due to cache inefficiencies in the Recursor

   CVE: CVE-2024-25590
   Date: 3rd of October 2024.
   Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.9.8, 5.0.8 and 5.1.1
   Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 4.9.9, 5.0.9 and 5.1.2
   Severity: High
   Impact: Denial of service
   Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker publishing a crafted zone
   Risk of system compromise: None
   Solution: Upgrade to patched version

   An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record
   Sets. Repeatedly processing and caching results for these sets can lead
   to a denial of service.

   CVSS Score: 7.5, see CVSS Calculator[1]

   The remedy is: upgrade to a patched version.

   We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for bringing this issue to
   our attention and assisting in validating the patches.
