The provided content is related to CVE-2023-39141.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the filename taken from the URL input. Specifically, the `node-server.js` file in the webui-aria2 project, at line 10, uses the pathname from the URL to construct the file path without ensuring the path stays within the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability. The application allows an attacker to traverse the file system and access files outside of the web application's intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read any file on the server that the user running the web server has read permissions for.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with path traversal sequences in the URL.
- Example: `curl --path-as-is http://localhost:8888/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
