{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `rleUncompress` function of OpenEXR.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can provide a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR can trigger a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a malformed image file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted image file to an application that uses the vulnerable OpenEXR library.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in versions before 3.0.3, and the fix is implemented in commits `25259a84827234a283f6f9db72978198c7a3f268` and `37750013830def57f19f3c3b7faaa9fc1dae81b3`. The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the RLE decompression, where the input buffer size is not checked correctly leading to potential out-of-bounds reads and writes during decompression. The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check to ensure that input buffer has enough bytes for processing run-length encoded data."
