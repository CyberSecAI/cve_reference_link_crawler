| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-11 15:42:14 UTC  ``` A heap-buffer overflow was found in the rleUncompress function of OpenEXR in versions before 3.0.3. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application compiled against OpenEXR.   References：  <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1036>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-06-11 15:43:26 UTC  ``` Created OpenEXR tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1970993](show_bug.cgi?id=1970993 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-3605 OpenEXR: Heap buffer overflow in the rleUncompress function [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-OpenEXR tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1970994](show_bug.cgi?id=1970994 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3605 mingw-OpenEXR: OpenEXR: Heap buffer overflow in the rleUncompress function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-06-27 12:22:12 UTC  ``` Hi,   This could be a duplicate for the assigned [CVE-2020-11760](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11760). Can you check it the CVE is meant to cover another attack vector in case you agree?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c6)  Shawn Jamison    2021-06-28 15:59:59 UTC  ``` Good catch - thank you.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c7)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-07-06 12:51:34 UTC  ``` Hi  (In reply to Shawn Jamison from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c6)) > Good catch - thank you.  Thank for double-checking. In this case can you REJECT [CVE-2021-3605](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3605) and remove the alias for this bug as well later?  This will avoid some confusion in tracking those CVEs.  Thank you already!   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-07-06 17:51:26 UTC  ``` Actually this might have been wrong. Further triage in Debian by Syvain Beucler has shown the following, but again please double-check if this is correct:  [CVE-2020-11760](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11760) is specifically for  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1987> and fixed with <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/commit/37750013830def57f19f3c3b7faaa9fc1dae81b3>   [CVE-2021-3605](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3605) initially refers to your Bugzilla entry, referring to <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/pull/1036> and so possibly <https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/commit/25259a84827234a283f6f9db72978198c7a3f268> which is differnt part of the code, patched very similarly.  So form a further round of review it looks safe to assume both CVEs are valid and distinct.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c9)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-07-07 20:12:57 UTC  ``` Hi Shawn,  As per [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c8), seems the two CVEs are distinct. Can you review them and let me know, please?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c10)  Shawn Jamison    2021-07-19 21:54:06 UTC  ``` Upon closer review, they are indeed distinct. I believe I've taken the steps needed to separate this flaw from [CVE-2020-11760](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11760). Can you review and let me know if additional actions are needed, please?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c11)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-07-22 13:41:34 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1970991#c10): > Upon closer review, they are indeed distinct. I believe I've taken the steps > needed to separate this flaw from [CVE-2020-11760](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11760). Can you review and let me > know if additional actions are needed, please?  I think it would be better to make comments like '*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 1829006](show_bug.cgi?id=1829006 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-11760 OpenEXR: out-of-bounds read during RLE uncompression in rleUncompress function in ImfRle.cpp") ***' being marked private on both flaw bugs for avoid confusion. Also, please add the fixedin version information when available so we can report this CVE to Mitre.  Let me know if you have any additional questions.   ``` |  |
