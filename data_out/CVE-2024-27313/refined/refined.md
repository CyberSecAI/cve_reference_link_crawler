- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because user input is not sanitized before being included in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts, potentially leading to malicious actions on the PAM360 server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious scripts into user-supplied input that is then reflected in the applicationâ€™s response. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into a user-controlled input field that will be reflected in the server response. They do not need to be authenticated.
