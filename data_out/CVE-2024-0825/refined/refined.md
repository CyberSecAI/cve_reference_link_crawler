{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the deserialization of untrusted data within the `duplicate_gallery` function. The `vimeography_duplicate_gallery_serialized` parameter, which is intended to be a JSON string, is not properly sanitized before being passed to `json_decode`, which can allow for PHP Object Injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
      "PHP Object Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the WordPress REST API endpoint for duplicating a gallery, specifically by exploiting the `vimeography_duplicate_gallery_serialized` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor access or higher to exploit this vulnerability."
