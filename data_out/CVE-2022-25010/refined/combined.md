### @natano **[natano](/natano)** commented [Feb 6, 2022](#issue-1125216177)

On linux `/` is mounted to `/rootfs` in RageFile, which allows access to the *whole* filesystem from lua. This means themes and mod files can re-write user data and extract files via USB profiles.

`/rootfs` was only added for internal use by the alsa, oss and memory card drivers, so it can be easily replaced with direct fstream file access.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Good spot, this behaviour hasn't been needed in a very very long time. Will also port to OF, thanks for reporting! |
