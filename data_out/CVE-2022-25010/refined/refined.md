The content is related to CVE-2022-25010.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that on Linux systems, the root filesystem `/` was mounted as `/rootfs` within the `RageFile` system of the Stepmania application. This allowed Lua scripts to access and manipulate any part of the file system via `/rootfs`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file system access through Lua scripting.
- Exposure of user data and system files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious themes or mod files could rewrite user data
- Malicious themes or mod files could extract files, including potentially sensitive user files, via USB profiles.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted themes or mod files executed by the Stepmania application.
- These malicious files could be distributed through file sharing, or malicious websites hosting custom content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious theme or mod file for the Stepmania application.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into installing or using the malicious files.
