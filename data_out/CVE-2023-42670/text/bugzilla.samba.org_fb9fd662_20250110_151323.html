| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c0)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-09-12 00:26:01 UTC  ``` In some attacker-controllable circumstances, both 'samba' (the AD DC) and samba-dcerpcd can be listening on the same sockets.  The primary symptom to users, is in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) that the Domain Controller could not be contacted. The error is "The procedure number is out of range."  The failing NetLogon call, DsrGetDcNameEx2, is implemented in the  soruce4 RPC server used by Samba Active Directory, but the corresponding implementation in samba-dcerpcd/source3 is just a stub, which raises a “procedure number out of range” error when called.   In the past we had this list:  static void lp_enforce_ad_dc_settings(void) {         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "passdb backend", "samba_dsdb");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM,                         "winbindd:use external pipes", "true");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:default", "external");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:svcctl", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:srvsvc", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:eventlog", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:ntsvcs", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:winreg", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:spoolss", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_daemon:spoolssd", "embedded");         lp_do_parameter(GLOBAL_SECTION_SNUM, "rpc_server:tcpip", "no"); }  This set, for named pipes (not TCP, which always went to 'samba' - the AD DC), the policy of which half of the project handled which request, in the AD DC.  However in the new samba-dcerpcd architecture, this list is not consulted, instead local_np_connect_connected() either succeeds, or if it fails it starts samba-dcerpcd to provide service.  If the attacker can make that connect fail after the socket() call (eg by keeping the Samba AD DC RPC server busy), then they can make samba- dcerpcd start, and then samba-dcerpcd workers will then race with samba to answer any following ncacn_np binds, providing the s3 version of (eg) NETLOGON.  We also need to ensure that samba-dcerpcd never binds to pipes not in it's own list by modifying rpc_lsad and similar code to never offer 'source3' RPC servers where they would conflict with the AD DC mode, just as lp_enforce_ad_dc_settings() used to do. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c1)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-09-12 09:37:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18096](attachment.cgi?id=18096 "Patch for master v1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18096&action=edit "Patch for master v1") Patch for master v1 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c2)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-09-12 09:38:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18097](attachment.cgi?id=18097 "Initial Advisory without CVE (v1)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18097&action=edit "Initial Advisory without CVE (v1)") Initial Advisory without CVE (v1) ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c3)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-09-25 04:06:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18118](attachment.cgi?id=18118 "patch for master v2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18118&action=edit "patch for master v2") patch for master v2 ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c4)  Andrew Bartlett    2023-09-25 04:10:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 18119](attachment.cgi?id=18119 "Advisory v2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18119&action=edit "Advisory v2") Advisory v2 ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=15473#c5)  Alexander Bokovoy    2023-09-26 08:17:12 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 18118](attachment.cgi?id=18118 "patch for master v2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=18118&action=edit "patch for master v2") patch for master v2  please add an in-place comments that the duplicated service references must be the last in the arrays.
