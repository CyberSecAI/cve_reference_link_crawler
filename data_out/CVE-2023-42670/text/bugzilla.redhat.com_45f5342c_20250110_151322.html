It is susceptible to a vulnerability where multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active Directory Users. This flaw allows an attacker to disrupt AD DC services. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2241885#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-03 07:34:40 UTC  ``` Samba can be made to start multiple incompatible RPC listeners, disrupting service on the AD DC. When Samba's RPC server is under load, or otherwise not responding, the servers NOT built for the AD DC (eg build instead for the NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can be incorrectly started, and compete to listen on the same unix domain sockets. This then results in some queries being answered by the AD DC, and some not. "The procedure number is out of range" when starting Active Directory Users and Computers tool, however it can also be triggered maliciously, to prevent service on the AD DC.  <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15473>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2241885#c1)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-11 10:44:45 UTC  ``` This CVE is now Public: <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-42670.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2241885#c2)  TEJ RATHI    2023-10-11 10:46:15 UTC  ``` Created samba tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2243232](show_bug.cgi?id=2243232 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-42670 samba: AD DC Busy RPC multiple listener DoS [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
