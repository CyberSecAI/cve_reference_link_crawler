Support was good for a year or so, but I have a critical error (cannot edit any elementor pages with the free plugin active and cannot active my paid version) and I have heard nothing from my ticket in a week. Also tweeted and DMed them and no response.

I purchased because of the product. I stayed because of the service. I really like the features and they have implemented well onto my website. However, as is true with lots of technology, bugs happen. The true measure of a product is how well the company will support their product and make improvements. I have to say that the support team at Droit has been great. Feedback is timely and they are quick to implement custom suggestions or provide product updates regularly.
If you’re intrigued by any of their products, rest assured that you will be well taken care of with top notch service!
