### Description

The Droit Elementor Addons – Widgets, Blocks, Templates Library For Elementor Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's widgets in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as URL. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Support was good for a year or so, but I have a critical error (cannot edit any elementor pages with the free plugin active and cannot active my paid version) and I have heard nothing from my ticket in a week. Also tweeted and DMed them and no response.

I purchased because of the product. I stayed because of the service. I really like the features and they have implemented well onto my website. However, as is true with lots of technology, bugs happen. The true measure of a product is how well the company will support their product and make improvements. I have to say that the support team at Droit has been great. Feedback is timely and they are quick to implement custom suggestions or provide product updates regularly.
If you’re intrigued by any of their products, rest assured that you will be well taken care of with top notch service!
