Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3020:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `hawk_invoke` binary in ClusterLabs Hawk. This binary is intended to be used as a setuid program, allowing the `hacluster` user to execute specific commands as root. However, the program allows the user to execute an interactive "shell" that is not limited to the intended safe commands, leading to privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted command execution:** The `hawk_invoke` binary does not properly restrict the commands that can be executed, allowing arbitrary command execution.
*   **Setuid binary:** The use of a setuid binary to execute commands as root is a security risk if not carefully implemented, as demonstrated in this case.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** A local attacker with access to the `hacluster` user can gain root privileges by exploiting the unrestricted shell in the `hawk_invoke` binary.
*   **Full system compromise:** With root privileges, the attacker can fully compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to run commands as the `hacluster` user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have access to the system with the ability to execute commands as the `hacluster` user.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in ClusterLabs Hawk versions up to 2.3.0-15.
*   The fix involves removing the `hawk_invoke` binary and using `capture3` for running system commands. This removes the vulnerability by eliminating the setuid binary and the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
*   The commit `c538024` in `crmsh` is related to setting up authorized SSH access for `hacluster` and also mentions the CVE-2021-3020. It does not contain the fix for the vulnerability in Hawk, but shows the context of the vulnerability
*   The fix for CVE-2021-3020 was implemented in Hawk releases 2.6.3.15 and 2.6.3.12, where `hawk_invoke` is removed.
