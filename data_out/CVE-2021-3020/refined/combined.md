## Description

An issue was discovered in ClusterLabs Hawk (aka HA Web Konsole) through 2.3.0-15. It ships the binary hawk\_invoke (built from tools/hawk\_invoke.c), intended to be used as a setuid program. This allows the hacluster user to invoke certain commands as root (with an attempt to limit this to safe combinations). This user is able to execute an interactive "shell" that isn't limited to the commands specified in hawk\_invoke, allowing escalation to root.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

* Allow also users in haclient to view history explorer ([#214](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/214))
* Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 via puma ([#217](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/217)). This differ for SLE15 versions.

  This allows to disable via puma config disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS.1.1. (see <https://gist.github.com/MalloZup/f7cd3020e1165c800a4323860e8acb86>) for documentation howto.

# Bugfixes:

* handle properly in the webui when a Cluster resource has the same name of a node of cluster ([#210](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/pull/210))
