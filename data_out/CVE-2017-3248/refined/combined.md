# [R1] Oracle WebLogic RMI Registry UnicastRef Object Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Back in November of 2015, WebLogic was patched by Oracle to disallow deserialization of some dangerous Java objects. Oracle achieved this by blacklisting these specific packages:

1. org.apache.commons.collections.functors
2. com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax
3. javassist
4. org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ConvertedClosure
5. org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ConversionHandler
6. org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.MethodClosure

This protected WebLogic from the original ysoserial serializable payloads like `CommonCollections1` and `Groovy1`. Furthermore, this successfully protected WebLogic from new ysoserial payloads like `CommonCollection3` (released in February 2016). However, it does not protect WebLogic from all payloads.

RMI Connect Back

On February 24, 2016 the Jenkins build server project [released a security advisory](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2016-02-24). One of the vulnerabilities, [SECURITY-232](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY-232) aka CVE-2016-0788, indicated that it was possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to open a JMRP (Java Remote Method Protocol) listener which allowed for remote code execution. JRMP is used in conjunction with RMI (Remote Method Invocation). RMI is great for a deserialization attack since the communication is built around the serialization and deserialization of objects. Research into how CVE-2016-0788 works yielded two interesting finds.

The first was a [full implementation of that attack](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/82e5866e88ab8131e8c3e378d59d1e0ee712423f/test/src/test/java/jenkins/security/Security232Test.java) in Jenkins’ unit tests. The second interesting find was that the researcher credited with CVE-2016-0788, Moritz Bechler, forked ysoserial and published a [number of new/undisclosed payloads](https://github.com/mbechler/ysoserial/tree/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads).

In the case of WebLogic, we are interested in yososerial's `JRMPListener.java` payload. This serializes a `RemoteObjectInvocationHandler` which uses a `UnicastRef` object to establish a TCP connection to a remote server in order to get at the remote server's RMI registry. This connection uses JRMP so the client will deserialize whatever the server responds with, achieving unauthenticated remote code execution.

Exploiting WebLogic

To demonstrate the issue to ZDI and Oracle, Tenable created two scripts. The first script is a server that listens for the callback, called `jrmp_listener.py`. When the connect back connects to `jrmp_listener.py` it will send a `CommonCollections3` payload in response which will trigger the RCE on WebLogic. The second script sends the serialized object to WebLogic via `t3` on TCP port 7001 (just like the original FoxGlove attack), called `jrmp_connect_back.py`. In order to exploit WebLogic, `jrmp_listener.py` must be executed before `jrmp_connect_back.py`. The result of the exploitation will cause the connect back, which exists on its own thread, to be executed multiple times (which means an attacker could deliver multiple payloads).

### Solution

Oracle has released WebLogic 12.2.1.2 to address this vulnerability.

### Disclosure Timeline

2016-03-03 - Issue discovered
2016-03-15 - Final testing of issue
2016-03-16 - Submitted to ZDI, case bainesjr0002
2016-04-12 - ZDI indicates they cannot reproduce on 12.2.1, asks Tenable to look confirm
2016-04-13 - Tenable confirms RCE was unsuccessful on 12.2.1 but provides a PoC for 12.1.3
2016-04-13 - ZDI acknowledges new information, will evaluate
2016-04-26 - ZDI says "It seems that this one was tested against older version and it no longer hits for us. Do you agree?"
2016-04-27 - Tenable does not agree, asks for clarification from ZDI
2016-04-27 - ZDI acknowledges feedback, will gather information.
2016-05-02 - ZDI declines case bainesjr0002 due to failure to gain execution on 12.2.1. ZDI closes bainesjr0002
2016-05-05 - Tenable rewrites PoC to work with 12.2.1. Resubmitted to ZDI, case bainesjr0008 opened
2016-06-03 - ZDI indicates they "can't get this to hit" and provide Tenable with a stack trace.
2016-06-06 - The provided stack trace looks a little off so Tenable asks for further details. Tenable reverified that the attack does work on their test setup using 12.2.1 and the lastest Java (1.8.0\_92)
2016-06-06 - Tenable realizes there is a bug in the PoC which causes deserialization failure if the connect back address is 13 bytes or longer. Ask ZDI if they can work around the bug else a new script will be produced.
2016-06-06 - ZDI confirms they can work around the bug
2016-06-13 - ZDI accepts and pays $1k.
2016-06-30 - ZDI reports issue to vendor
2017-01-17 - Oracle releases Jan 2017 CPU with fix
2017-01-24 - ZDI publishes issue (ZDI-17-055)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that the vulnerabilities in this Critical Patch Update are scored using version 3.0 of Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard (CVSS).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available [here](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Affected Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below to access the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions.

For an overview of the Oracle product documentation related to this Critical Patch Update, please refer to the Oracle Critical Patch Update January 2017 Documentation Map, [My Oracle Support Note](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2194543.1).

The list of affected product releases and versions that are in Premier Support or Extended Support, under the [Oracle Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/) is as follows:

| Affected Products and Versions | Patch Availability |

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2203916.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2203916.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 17 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  16 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.
