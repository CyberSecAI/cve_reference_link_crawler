  "CVE-2017-3248": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Oracle WebLogic RMI Registry UnicastRef Object Java Deserialization Remote Code Execution",
    "details": "This vulnerability is due to a flaw in how WebLogic handles deserialization of Java objects via the RMI registry. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted serialized object over the T3 protocol. This object includes a 'JRMPListener' payload, which uses a 'UnicastRef' to initiate a JRMP connection back to the attacker-controlled server, which in turn responds with a 'CommonCollections3' payload to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability is a result of WebLogic failing to adequately blacklist dangerous java objects leading to the ability for attackers to abuse Java deserialization and execute code remotely.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Oracle WebLogic 10.3.6.0",
      "Oracle WebLogic 12.1.3.0",
      "Oracle WebLogic 12.2.1.0",
      "Oracle WebLogic 12.2.1.1"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insecure deserialization of Java objects received over RMI/JRMP combined with a failure to blacklist dangerous Java objects, allows attackers to deliver arbitrary payloads.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "Insecure Deserialization",
         "Missing Blacklist of Dangerous Java Objects"
       ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to fully compromise the server.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, utilizing the T3 protocol to send a specially crafted serialized Java object to a vulnerable WebLogic server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send raw TCP packets to the vulnerable service to exploit this vulnerability, and set up an intermediate server to deliver the final payload. No authentication is required."
    },
   "detection": {
     "method": "The provided python script can be used to check if the target is vulnerable by sending the necessary packets and verifying if the response contains the expected 'cannot be cast to weblogic' string. For exploitation, the script requires a 'ysoserial' jar file and will generate a payload and a command to start a JRMP listener for a callback connection to trigger the vulnerability."
    },
    "remediation": "Upgrade to WebLogic version 12.2.1.2 or apply the patch provided by Oracle in the January 2017 Critical Patch Update."
  }
