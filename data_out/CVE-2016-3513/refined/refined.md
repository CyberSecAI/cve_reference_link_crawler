Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2016-3513:

**1. Verification:**

   - The advisory from synacktiv.com explicitly mentions "Vulnerability fixed in Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2016 / CVE-2016-3513".
   - The Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory from oracle.com lists "Oracle Communications Operations Monitor, version(s) prior to 3.3.92.0.0" as an affected product, and the risk matrix lists the vulnerability with CVE-2016-3513, confirming the relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a **configuration issue** in the Oracle Enterprise Communication Monitor web application. Specifically, the session cookies are not marked with the "Secure" and "HttpOnly" attributes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Missing "Secure" Attribute:** Without the "secure" attribute, session cookies can be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, even if there is an HTTP to HTTPS redirection. This can lead to the exposure of session identifiers and anti-CSRF tokens.
   - **Missing "HttpOnly" Attribute:** The absence of the "HttpOnly" attribute allows client-side scripts (like JavaScript) to manipulate session cookies, potentially facilitating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can intercept session cookies transmitted over insecure HTTP connections, leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
   - **CSRF Attacks:** Leaked CSRF tokens can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user without the user's knowledge or consent.
    - **XSS Attacks**: Attackers can leverage XSS attacks to manipulate cookies

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker performing a MitM attack on an HTTP connection can intercept the session cookies if the "Secure" flag is not set.
   - **Client-Side Script Injection**: An attacker performing a XSS attack can execute malicious Javascript code to manipulate the session cookies.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a user and the Oracle Enterprise Communication Monitor, or be able to perform a client side attack
   - **MitM Capability (for insecure HTTP):** An attacker needs the capability to perform MitM attacks to intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic.
   - **Ability to Inject Malicious Scripting:** For XSS attacks, the attacker must be able to inject and execute malicious Javascript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The synacktiv.com content provides more detailed information about the specific vulnerability than the brief CVE description, elaborating on the lack of "Secure" and "HttpOnly" attributes.
*   The Oracle advisory provides more context by showing that this is one of the many vulnerabilities fixed in the July 2016 CPU.
*   The Oracle advisory also includes a CVSS score of 6.5 for the vulnerability, with an attack vector of "Network" and low complexity.
