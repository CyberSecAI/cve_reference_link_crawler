## Research Projects

### TRITON

TRITON is the first known cyberattack that directly interacted with a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). Labs reverse engineered the TriStation suite of software and delivered a report and two free tools for security researchers. This research was presented at Black Hat USA 2018.

### GreyEnergy

The Labs team reverse engineered the GreyEnergy malicious document (maldoc) that leads to the installation of the malware (backdoor) on a victimâs network. Project outcomes include a report, multiple blogs and two free tools for security researchers.

### IEC 62351

IEC Working Group 15 (WG15) is developing technology standards for secure-by-design power systems. Labs contributes to the standards and has demonstrated how they can be used to identify hard-to-detect cyberattacks. Research from this effort was presented at Black Hat USA 2019.
