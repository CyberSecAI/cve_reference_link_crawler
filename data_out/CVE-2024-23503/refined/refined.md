Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Broken Access Control issue within the Ninja Tables plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with the "Contributor" role to preview tables using shortcodes. This action should be restricted to users with "Administrator" roles or equivalent privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the inadequate access control mechanism, which fails to prevent unauthorized access to a functionality. Specifically, lower-privileged users can access and preview table data using shortcodes, an action intended for higher-privileged users.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** There is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check when previewing tables via shortcodes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A user with "Contributor" privileges can access and preview any created tables in the Ninja Tables plugin that should only be visible to higher-privileged users.
*   Although the provided details specify the issue was rejected on 2024 Jan 25, the information may still be useful.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the use of a shortcode to preview tables within the WordPress environment.
*   The attacker needs to be a logged in user with the "Contributor" role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with the "Contributor" role.
