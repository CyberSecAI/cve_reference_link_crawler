### Description

The 10Web AI Assistant – AI content writing assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the install\_plugin AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins that can be used to gain further access to a compromised site.
