Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-28136:

**CVE-2022-28136**

*   **Root Cause:** The JiraTestResultReporter Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Vulnerability:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks in a form validation method. This allows unauthorized access to the form validation.
    *   **CSRF:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials by exploiting the missing permission check.
    *   An attacker can trigger the vulnerable form validation method via CSRF, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is network-based, as the attacker sends requests to the Jenkins server.
    *   **CSRF:** The CSRF vulnerability allows the attacker to trick a user's browser into making an unauthorized request to the Jenkins server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance to exploit the missing permission check.
    *   For the CSRF, an attacker would need to trick a user into accessing a malicious link/page while logged in into Jenkins.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-28136 is caused by the JiraTestResultReporter Plugin's lack of permission checks on a form validation method. This, coupled with the absence of POST request requirements, creates both a missing permission check vulnerability and a CSRF vulnerability.  The impact allows an attacker to connect to an arbitrary URL using attacker-specified credentials.
