## (Pwn2Own) Tesla Model 3 bsa\_server BIP Heap-based Buffer Overflow Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-973ZDI-CAN-20737

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-32157](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32157) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 4.6, [AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Model 3 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model 3 vehicles. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the bsa\_server process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of an unprivileged user in a sandboxed process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Fixed in 2023.20 firmware release. |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2023-03-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2023-07-18 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
