The provided content describes a fix for a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DWC3 USB driver.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a missing removal of a spinlock during gadget suspend/resume operations when the DWC3 controller operates in dual-role mode, specifically when acting as a USB device. The commit 5265397f9442 ("usb: dwc3: Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume") removed some locks but forgot to remove the otg mode lock, causing a deadlock.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- **Deadlock:** The code attempts to acquire the same spinlock (`dwc->lock`) twice within the `dwc3_suspend_common` function during suspend, resulting in a deadlock. This occurs because `dwc3_gadget_suspend` calls `dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect` which attempts to acquire the same spinlock a second time.
- **Missing Lock Removal:**  The primary weakness is that commit 5265397f9442 did not completely remove all relevant locks during gadget suspend/resume, specifically the lock related to the otg mode, leaving a double lock situation in the gadget suspend path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Hang/Deadlock:** The system becomes unresponsive when entering suspend mode because the kernel threads are blocked waiting on the same lock.
- **Denial of Service:** The deadlock prevents the system from suspending correctly and can cause a denial of service, as the device becomes unusable and might require a hard reset.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **System Suspend:** The vulnerability is triggered by putting the system into suspend state using `echo mem > /sys/power/state`.
- **Dual-Role Configuration:** The system must have the `CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE` option enabled for the vulnerability to be exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User-level Access:** The attacker needs user-level access to the system to execute the command to trigger the system suspend.
- **System Configuration:** The system must be configured to enable dual role support for the DWC3 USB controller.
