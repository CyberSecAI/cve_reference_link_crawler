{
  "CVE-2021-47355": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `nicstar_cleanup` function in the `nicstar` driver uses `del_timer()` to remove a timer. This function does not guarantee the timer handler has completed before returning. Thus the timer handler might still be running after the driver's cleanup and cause a use-after-free when accessing driver resources.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to system instability, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `nicstar` driver is unloaded, and the timer handler attempts to access resources that have been freed during driver cleanup. ",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the unloading of the `nicstar` driver, which is a privileged operation, so local access or having necessary capabilities is required."
