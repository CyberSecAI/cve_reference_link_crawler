# ACF 6.3.6 Security Release

Last Updated August 28, 2024
3 minute read

---

**Advanced Custom Fields version 6.3.6 is now available.**

This release contains important security fixes, along with other bug fixes and a new field setting to mark fields as accessible to content editors via Block Bindings or the ACF Shortcode.

## Field Value Access in the Content Editor

The ACF shortcode is a way for content editors to access ACF field values when creating and displaying post content. Recent releases of ACF have made significant improvements to the security of the ACF Shortcode, and to further this the ACF Shortcode is disabled by default for new installs of ACF 6.3.0 and later. However, allowing site users to access field data in the editor requires trust and will always have an inherent security risk. That is also more of an issue with recent WordPress features like [Block Bindings](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/) and [Bits](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/06/08/proposal-bits-as-dynamic-tokens/) (which is coming soon).

In order to support these new features securely, and improve the level of security for the existing ACF Shortcode, ACF 6.3.6 introduces a new field level setting, `Allow Access to Value in Editor UI`. This setting marks a field as allowable for editors to access and use the field value inside content.

For example, this means developers can allow certain fields to be accessed by the ACF shortcode without allowing content editors to access fields used on internal Options Pages that only site admins should access.

The field setting can be accessed by editing the field and navigating to the ‚ÄòPresentation‚Äô tab:

![An example screenshot showing the new setting for exposing fields in editor UI features](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bindings_ui.png?v=1.1)

For any fields created prior to ACF 6.3.6 the setting is enabled by default matching the existing behavior, but for all new fields added after, it will be disabled. This means that when creating fields, you‚Äôll need to explicitly opt-in to allowing content editors to access the field. This will not impact any code-based accessing of values, such as `the_field`,`get_field`, or `get_post_meta`, and only applies to any existing or upcoming methods for accessing field values in the content editor.

We recommend that after upgrading to 6.3.6, ACF users revisit their field groups and fields and toggle the setting to ‚Äòoff‚Äô for any fields which contain sensitive information, especially for those fields attached to Options Pages or users.

## Wrap Up

We take the security of ACF extremely seriously and are always working on protecting our users. If you have discovered a vulnerability in the code or have a security issue, please see our [Security](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/security/) page for more information.

  This is great! I‚Äôve tried it and it works! Is there a way to display the file url if I am using the ACF file field (the return value is set to File array)? Thanks!
