Based on the provided information, the content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `__alloc_range()` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/drm_buddy.c` was incorrectly returning success even when it couldn't allocate the requested memory size. This happened in specific corner cases when the total allocated memory was less than the required size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect error handling in `__alloc_range()`.
- Failure to return an appropriate error code (-ENOSPC) when the requested memory allocation fails due to insufficient available space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Display corruption issues, particularly observed when booting to KDE Plasma or playing games. This suggests that the insufficient memory allocation leads to issues with graphics rendering.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the system tries to allocate contiguous memory blocks using the DRM buddy allocator and there are not enough contiguous blocks to satisfy the request.
- The vulnerability is triggered by normal usage of the graphics subsystem which is common.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position are required.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by normal system operation involving graphics memory allocation.

**More details than the CVE description:**
The provided content gives explicit details regarding the cause of the issue, including the fact it was related to an incorrect return status in `__alloc_range()`. It also identifies the specific symptom of display corruption during normal usage. Furthermore, it specifies the problematic commit `0a1844bf0b53`, and the affected driver component `drm/buddy`.
