- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login page of the SNS administration can interpret JavaScript code. A user with write access to the SNS can include a disclaimer containing malicious JavaScript, which will then be executed when a user views the login page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the login disclaimer field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with write access to the Stormshield Network Security (SNS) appliance can insert malicious JavaScript code into the login disclaimer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have write access to the SNS appliance to configure the login disclaimer. User interaction is required as the malicious code executes when a victim views the login page.
