Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of input parameters within the Synetics idoit pro application. Specifically, the parameters `id`, `lang`, `mNavID`, `name`, `pID`, `treeNode`, `type`, and `view` are not properly sanitized, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Improper input sanitization: Specifically, multiple parameters are not being sanitized correctly, `id,lang,mNavID,name,pID,treeNode,type,view`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve session details of an authenticated user. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the web interface of the application by injecting malicious scripts via the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application with the vulnerable parameters containing malicious code.
- The attacker needs to have low privileged access (PR:L).
