[CVE-2018-25031  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-25031) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-918  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `swagger-ui` to version 4.1.3 or higher.

## Overview

[swagger-ui](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is a library that allows interaction and visualisation of APIs.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the `?url` parameter, which was intended to allow displaying remote OpenAPI definitions. This functionality may pose a risk for users who host their own SwaggerUI instances. In particular, including remote OpenAPI definitions opens a vector for phishing attacks by abusing the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances.

**NOTE:** This vulnerability has also been identified as: [CVE-2021-46708](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SWAGGERUI-6056392)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.4 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
