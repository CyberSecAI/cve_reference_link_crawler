Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-25031:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `swagger-ui` library's ability to load OpenAPI definitions from a URL specified in the `url` query parameter. This allows an attacker to override the intended schema file by providing a malicious one.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `?url` parameter can be exploited to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially internal resources.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could use the URL parameter to trick users into leaking login credentials by presenting a modified schema that points to attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Unintended Schema Loading:** The ability to override a hard-coded schema file through the query parameter was an unintended functionality that created an attack vector.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to internal resources and data.
*  **Data Modification**: An attacker can potentially change the data by sending the victim to a crafted swagger page.
*   **Credential Leaks:** Users could be tricked into providing credentials to a malicious server, facilitating account takeovers.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `?url` query parameter in the `swagger-ui` web application. By crafting a URL that includes a malicious or controlled resource path as the value for the `url` parameter, an attacker can leverage the application's own functionality to perform actions that were not intended.
*  The user would need to load or be redirected to a crafted link for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious `?url` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to have a malicious Open API definition to load.
*  The attacker needs to entice or redirect users to access their crafted link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `swagger-ui` versions prior to 4.1.3.
*   The fix for this issue involves disabling the ability to read config parameters from URL search parameters by default and introducing a new core parameter called `queryConfigEnabled` to re-enable the functionality if needed.
*  The vulnerability is categorized as medium severity by both Snyk and NVD. Snyk rates it as 5.4 medium while NVD rates it as 4.3 medium.
*   Snyk provides a CVSS 3.1 score of 5.4 with the following details: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   NVD provides a CVSS 3.1 score of 4.3: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
