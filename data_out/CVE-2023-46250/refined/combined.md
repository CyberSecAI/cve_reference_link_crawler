# Possible Infinite Loop when PdfWriter(clone\_from) is used with a PDF

Moderate

[MartinThoma](/MartinThoma)
published
GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f
Oct 29, 2023

## Package

pip

pypdf
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=3.7.0,<=3.16.4

## Patched versions

>=3.17.0

## Description

### Impact

An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop.

This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage.

That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations.

### Patches

The issue was fixed with [#2264](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264)

### Workarounds

If you cannot update your version of pypdf, you should modify `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` just like [#2264](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264) did.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Alexhuszagh **[Alexhuszagh](/Alexhuszagh)** commented [Oct 23, 2023](#issue-1957889819) • edited Loading

Use a visited memo to check if the current object in the clone operation has already been visited, and if so, do not add it to the list of objects. This avoids infinite recursion in case there are references to identical objects inside a PDF.

Unfortunately, since the example PDF contains financial data from a client I'm not free to provide the failing example that caused this PR. If you have a suggestion on how to remove that data while keeping the references identical, I'd be more than happy to contribute that. I hope the implementation is logical enough so this isn't needed.

The code that fails is as simple as:

```
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
reader = PdfReader('/path/to/sensitive/file.pdf')
writer = PdfWriter('myfilename.pdf', clone_from=reader)
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I didn't apply the mypy lint to [filters.py](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/9047079045742f09df1a2f5ff40d4b316ec35f7a/pypdf/filters.py#L882) but would be more than happy to do so. My only major question would be then do I need to check if the PDFs are identical for the `id(pdf)` inside (so rather than just the generation and idnum, but also the PDF id)? |

If you have a suggestion on how to remove that data while keeping the references identical, I'd be more than happy to contribute that. I hope the implementation is logical enough so this isn't needed.  [@Alexhuszagh](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh) Do you accept to wipe out text with `.remove_text()` and then share the file in private by mail with [@MartinThoma](https://github.com/MartinThoma) ?  I just got approval to send the clean version over from the client and just sent it over. |

SEC: Infinite recursion when using PdfWriter(clone\_from=reader) ([#2264](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264))

```
Use a visited memo to check if the current object in the clone operation has already been visited, and if so, do not add it to the list of objects.

This avoids infinite recursion in case there are links to the same object inside a PDF.
