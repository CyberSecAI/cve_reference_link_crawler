SEC: Infinite recursion when using PdfWriter(clone\_from=reader) ([#2264](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264))

```
Use a visited memo to check if the current object in the clone operation has already been visited, and if so, do not add it to the list of objects.

This avoids infinite recursion in case there are links to the same object inside a PDF.
