Use a visited memo to check if the current object in the clone operation has already been visited, and if so, do not add it to the list of objects. This avoids infinite recursion in case there are references to identical objects inside a PDF.

Unfortunately, since the example PDF contains financial data from a client I'm not free to provide the failing example that caused this PR. If you have a suggestion on how to remove that data while keeping the references identical, I'd be more than happy to contribute that. I hope the implementation is logical enough so this isn't needed.

The code that fails is as simple as:

```
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
reader = PdfReader('/path/to/sensitive/file.pdf')
writer = PdfWriter('myfilename.pdf', clone_from=reader)
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I didn't apply the mypy lint to [filters.py](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/9047079045742f09df1a2f5ff40d4b316ec35f7a/pypdf/filters.py#L882) but would be more than happy to do so. My only major question would be then do I need to check if the PDFs are identical for the `id(pdf)` inside (so rather than just the generation and idnum, but also the PDF id)? |
