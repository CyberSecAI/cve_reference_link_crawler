Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-25830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control due to an insecure design vulnerability. Specifically, the device lacks proper directory access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Design:** The system allows unauthorized access to configuration files due to a lack of access controls.
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):**  The `/admin/config_all.php` endpoint can be accessed without any authentication, allowing retrieval of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can extract sensitive information.
*   Specifically, an attacker can obtain the root and admin passwords stored in the configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URI that points to the configuration file path. The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device on the network.
*   No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for the `/admin/config_all.php` endpoint, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to access configuration data, including the root and admin passwords.
