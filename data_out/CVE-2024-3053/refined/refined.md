Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-3053

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `id` attribute within the `forminator_form` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the page containing the injected shortcode, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `forminator_form` shortcode.
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `id` attribute of the shortcode, using it as a vehicle to introduce code into a page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher.
- The attacker needs the ability to create or edit posts/pages where the vulnerable shortcode is used.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Forminator plugin versions up to and including 1.29.2.
- The fix is included in version 1.29.3, which sanitizes the `id` attribute by casting it to an integer and removing any potentially malicious code.
- The `library/render/class-render-form.php` file was modified to sanitize the shortcode attribute and the `library/model/class-form-entry-model.php` was modified to use `$wpdb->prepare` in favor of `esc_sql` for sanitization.
