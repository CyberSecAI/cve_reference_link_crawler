Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization check** in the `rednao_smart_forms_entries_list` AJAX action within the Smart Forms WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control (OWASP A5):** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to sensitive functionality, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The specific weakness is the absence of a check to verify if the user is authorized to access form data through the AJAX action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  Any authenticated user (even a subscriber with minimal privileges) can download form data. This could include personally identifiable information (PII) depending on the type of data collected in the forms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `rednao_smart_forms_entries_list` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress site. Even a subscriber-level account is sufficient for exploitation.
*   **Web Browser:** The attack can be executed by a normal web browser using the developer console.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the following parameters:
    *   `action`: `rednao_smart_forms_entries_list`
    *  `data`: A JSON string containing information about the form (e.g., `{"Form":"1"}`).
* The provided Proof of Concept in the description demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using the web browser's developer console.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.71 of the Smart Forms plugin.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium).
*   The researcher who discovered the vulnerability is Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
