| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2179427#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-03-17 18:05:16 UTC  ``` The course participation report required additional checks to prevent roles being displayed which the user did not have access to view. This flaw affects Moodle versions 4.1 to 4.1.1, 4.0 to 4.0.6, 3.11 to 3.11.12, 3.9 to 3.9.19 and earlier unsupported versions.  Reference: <https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=445069>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2179427#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-03-20 17:31:51 UTC  ``` Created moodle tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 2180099](show_bug.cgi?id=2180099 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-1402 moodle: Course participation report shows roles the user should not see [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2180098](show_bug.cgi?id=2180098 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-1402 moodle: Course participation report shows roles the user should not see [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2179427#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-03-20 21:33:56 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2179427#c3)  coreykelley    2024-11-25 10:55:56 UTC  ``` thanks for solution   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2179427#c4)  coreykelley    2024-11-25 13:03:12 UTC  ``` I appreciate the clarification regarding this CVE Bugzilla entry. It's reassuring to know that it doesn't impact commercially supported Red Hat products and is intended for community informational purposes.  Monitoring the related bugs is certainly a smart way to stay updated on the impacted community products! For anyone seeking help with any homework related to CVEs or cybersecurity, contacting experts or trustworthy services like <https://essaywritercheap.org/> can really simplify the process.   ``` |  |
