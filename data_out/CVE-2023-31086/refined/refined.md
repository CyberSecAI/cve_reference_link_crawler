{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Simple Giveaways plugin does not implement proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would execute unintended actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious request. An unauthenticated attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user."
