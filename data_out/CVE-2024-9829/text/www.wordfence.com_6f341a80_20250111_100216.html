### Description

The Download Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability checks on the 'dpwap\_handle\_download\_user' and 'dpwap\_handle\_download\_comment' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to download any comment, and download metadata for any user including user PII and sensitive information including username, email, hashed passwords and application passwords, session token information and more depending on set up and additional plugins installed.
