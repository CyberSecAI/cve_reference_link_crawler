- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure access control mechanisms allow users with default roles and permissions to access other users' playbook files if they know the specific `playbook_id`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control, information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authorized attacker can obtain sensitive information contained within playbook files, leading to a breach of confidentiality and exposure of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack where an attacker with valid user credentials uses a leaked `playbook_id` to access another user's playbook file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the application with default 'User' role.
    - The attacker needs to obtain a valid playbook ID of another user's playbook.
    - The attacker needs to be able to make a query to the system using the leaked playbook ID.
