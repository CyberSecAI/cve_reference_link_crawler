{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object within the `lsilogicR3DiagRegDataWrite` and `lsilogicR3DiagRegDataRead` functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition",
       "Insufficient locking mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in information disclosure from the guest system. An attacker can leverage this to potentially execute code in the context of the hypervisor when combined with other vulnerabilities. Other unspecified impacts may also occur.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the guest system with high privileges"
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the attacker must leverage the TOCTOU condition in the specific functions."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Oracle VirtualBox versions prior to 5.2.44, 6.0.24, and 6.1.12"
  ],
 "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the LsiLogicSCSI component of VirtualBox, which can lead to information disclosure. It may also be possible to leverage it to execute code in the context of the hypervisor."
