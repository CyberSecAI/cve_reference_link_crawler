Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing cleanup of `ao_info` in the error path within the `tcp_ao_info_cmd` function in `net/ipv4/tcp_ao.c`. Specifically, if `tcp_ao_required_verify(sk)` returns an error (indicated by `-EKEYREJECTED`), the function would exit without releasing the allocated `ao_info`. This memory leak was introduced in a previous commit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. If the `tcp_ao_required` condition is met, and the verification fails, the allocated `ao_info` structure is not freed. Repeated calls to this function under these conditions will lead to a buildup of unreleased memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary impact is memory exhaustion. An attacker could trigger the error path repeatedly, causing the kernel to leak memory until it potentially crashes or becomes unstable due to lack of resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the `tcp_ao_info_cmd` function, specifically by creating a socket and setting the `ao_required` flag in the command, and then failing the `tcp_ao_required_verify` check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create and manipulate TCP sockets, specifically with TCP-AO options.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the error path, which requires making the `tcp_ao_required_verify` to fail.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix introduces a `goto out;` statement to jump to the end of the function and free the allocated memory using a `kfree_skb` statement which was not included in the code provided above. This ensures that allocated memory is always released, regardless of the function's exit path.
- The vulnerability was introduced with TCP-AO functionality and was present in the Linux kernel.
- The fix has been backported to stable kernel branches.
