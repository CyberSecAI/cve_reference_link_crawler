Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `sps_add_update_post` function in the "Sync Post With Other Site" WordPress plugin lacked proper authorization checks. This function is responsible for creating and updating posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a capability check within the `sps_add_update_post` function. This allows any authenticated user, even those with minimal "Subscriber" level permissions, to call this function.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability allows any authenticated user to create or modify *any* post, not just their own, indicating a lack of ownership checks as well.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Post Creation:** Attackers with subscriber-level access (or higher) can create new draft posts on the target site.
*   **Unauthorized Post Modification:** Attackers can modify the content of existing posts, which could lead to defacement, injecting malicious content, or other forms of malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated to the WordPress site. The vulnerability is exploitable through the WordPress REST API endpoint `sps/v1/data`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid account on the target WordPress site with at least "Subscriber" level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint**: The attacker needs to know the REST API endpoint `/wp-json/sps/v1/data` to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the "Sync Post With Other Site" plugin up to and including 1.6.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7 by adding a capability check.
*   The fix was implemented by checking if the authenticated user has the 'edit_pages' or 'edit_posts' capability before allowing the `sps_add_update_post` function to execute.
*   The vulnerable function (`sps_add_update_post`) is called via a REST API endpoint, specifically `/wp-json/sps/v1/data` with the `sps_action` parameter set to 'add_update_post'.
*   The `sps_get_request` function handles authentication, and then calls the function specified in `sps_action` after authentication. Prior to the fix, it did not check the user's capabilities.
