The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/logDetailPage` of the xxl-job project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly displays job logs in HTML format without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS because it renders unfiltered user-controlled data (job logs) in HTML format.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the job logs, which will then be executed when an administrator views the logs through the `/xxl-job-admin/joblog/logDetailPage`.
- This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have the ability to influence the content of the job logs on the server where the `xxl-job-executor` is running.
- This can be done by directly modifying the log files on the file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have write access to the log files on the server where the `xxl-job-executor` is running.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the `xxl-job-admin` application. They only need to have the ability to modify log files.
