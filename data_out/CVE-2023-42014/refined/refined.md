- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header in the Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition Console is not set to the strictest available value. The CSP allows inline JavaScript and "eval" functions, which can be exploited for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insufficiently strict Content-Security-Policy header
    - Allowance of inline JavaScript execution
    - Allowance of `eval` function execution
- **Impact of exploitation:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through injected malicious JavaScript.
- **Attack vectors:** By passing engineered JavaScript through HTTP request parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid session, and then pass a crafted HTTP request containing malicious JavaScript.
