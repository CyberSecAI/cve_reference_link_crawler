- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the Netcom NS-ASG application security gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `config_ISCGroupTimePolicy.php` endpoint. The `GroupId` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information (like admin usernames and passwords in the provided example), modify data, or potentially take control of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by injecting malicious SQL code in the `GroupId` parameter of the `config_ISCGroupTimePolicy.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically requiring network access to the device running the vulnerable software, and some knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

The provided content gives details about the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/config_ISCGroupTimePolicy.php`) and includes a sample exploit URL. It also points to the vulnerable parameter (`GroupId`) as the source of the SQL injection. The impact is described as causing harm to servers, which would likely mean data exfiltration, modification or complete compromise. The provided details are more descriptive than a typical CVE description.
