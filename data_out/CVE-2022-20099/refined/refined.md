- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the `aee daemon`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to missing or inadequate bounds checking of input data in the `aee daemon`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local escalation of privilege, allowing an attacker to gain elevated access on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted input to the `aee daemon`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the affected device and must be able to interact with the `aee daemon`. System execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not required for successful exploitation.
