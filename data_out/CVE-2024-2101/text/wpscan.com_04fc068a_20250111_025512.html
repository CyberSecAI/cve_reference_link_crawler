## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Salon Booking System < 9.6.3 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the 'Mobile Phone' field when booking an appointment, allowing customers to conduct Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The payload gets triggered when an admin visits the 'Customers' page and the malicious script is executed in the admin context.

### Proof of Concept

1. As a first time customer, book an appointment by visiting the booking page http://localhost/booking/
2. At Step 5/7, enter details such as First name, Last name, E-mail and Address. In the Mobile phone field, enter the payload <script>alert(1)</script>
3. Enter the password and proceed to the next step. Once the booking process is complete, an account gets created for the customer.
4. Login as admin and visit the customers page http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=salon-customers
