- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Salon Booking System plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the 'Mobile Phone' field when booking an appointment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of an administrator's browser when they visit the 'Customers' page. This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and arbitrary actions performed on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated user can inject the malicious payload via the 'Mobile Phone' field when booking an appointment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the booking page and fill out the booking form. No authentication is required.
