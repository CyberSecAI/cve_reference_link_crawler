Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `cid` parameter in the `/admin/cms_content.php` file. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query within the `get_channel()` function, located in `/system/config.php`, without proper escaping or quoting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the `cid` parameter. The vulnerable code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating the user-supplied input, enabling attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** Both time-based and boolean-based blind SQL injection are possible due to the nature of how the injected code affects the query execution and subsequent response. Error-based SQL injection is also mentioned

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
- **Complete Database Takeover:** In severe cases, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database server depending on the permissions of the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the `/admin/cms_content.php` endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code via the `cid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable `/admin/cms_content.php` endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have an understanding of SQL injection techniques, including blind injection methods, to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the 'cid' parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited using SQLmap.
- The POC demonstrates different SQL injection techniques including boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind injections.
- The `get_channel()` function is where the unsanitized input leads to vulnerable SQL query generation.
- The description also emphasizes that even though it's a GET request, due to the complex cookie and session authentication, using a captured request file with sqlmap improves success rate.

This detailed information goes beyond the basic CVE description, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability.
