- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF protection when adding a new game, and does not sanitize or escape user input in settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): No CSRF check is implemented when adding a new game.
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input isn't sanitized or escaped, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into adding a new game with malicious XSS payloads. The injected XSS payload can then be executed when an administrator views the game entry, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted HTML form that exploits the lack of CSRF protection. The form is submitted to the vulnerable endpoint by an authenticated user (admin).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin into submitting the crafted form.
