{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cgiserver.cgi` process improperly handles JSON input, leading to an assertion failure and subsequent device reboot due to the lack of heartbeat.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation: The code assumes that the `param` JSON element is always an object, leading to an assertion failure when it's not.",
    "Denial of Service: By sending a crafted request with a non-object `param`, an attacker can cause the device to reboot."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The device reboots, causing a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body containing a command and a `param` that is not an object. This can be achieved using `curl`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. Authentication may be bypassed by using a vulnerability such as TALOS-2021-1420"
