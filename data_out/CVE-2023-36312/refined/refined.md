Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-36312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple POST parameters within the "Form fields" section of the Callback Widget's options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  The application stores unsanitized user input in the database, which is then rendered in the browser, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the form fields. When an administrator views the form fields, this stored XSS payload executes in their browser. This allows an attacker to perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is via the web interface of the Callback Widget. An attacker with access to the admin panel can navigate to "Options," then to "Form fields", capture the request when saving the form, and modify vulnerable parameters with the XSS payload. The vulnerability is triggered when the administrator views the form fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Callback Widgetâ€™s admin panel to access the Options and Form fields settings and save changes. The attacker must be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request, for instance using a web proxy like Burp Suite.
