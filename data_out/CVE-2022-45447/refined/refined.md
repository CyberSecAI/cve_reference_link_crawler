Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-45447:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input validation on the "f" parameter in the `/m4pdf/pdf.php` resource of the M4 PDF plugin for Prestashop sites. Specifically, the plugin does not properly check or restrict the path provided via the "f" parameter, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** The application allows access to files outside of the intended directory due to insufficient path validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to download arbitrary files from the server. The provided example indicates that an attacker could potentially download `/etc/passwd`, which could reveal sensitive system information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- The attack requires a low level of access complexity (AC:L).
- The attack requires a low level of privileges. The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable website (PR:L).
- No user interaction is needed (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a controlled "f" parameter to the vulnerable `/m4pdf/pdf.php` resource, and have a user account on the vulnerable web application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in M4 PDF plugin for Prestashop sites version 3.2.3 and earlier.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files.
