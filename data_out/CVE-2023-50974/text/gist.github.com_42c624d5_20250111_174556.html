AppWrite CLI - Too permissive access on preferences file

 [Raw](/SkypLabs/72ee00ecfa7d1a3494e2d69a24279c1d/raw/78c9cf74cb2872183a8b90b69905b81498b61f02/README.md)

# Appwrite CLI - Too permissive access on preferences file

## Description

When using the `login` command, the Appwrite CLI tool stores the credentials of the Appwrite user in the `~/.appwrite/prefs.json` file with 0644 as UNIX permissions. This is a security issue as it would allow any user of the local system to access those credentials.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install the latest version of the Appwrite CLI (2.0.2 to this day).
2. Log into an Appwrite instance using the `appwrite login` command.
3. Check the permissions of the preferences file.

In practice:

```
❯ appwrite -v
2.0.2

❯ appwrite login
? Enter your email admin@redacted.com
? Enter your password ****************
? Enter the endpoint of your Appwrite server https://appwrite.redacted.com/v1

✓ Success

❯ ll ~/.appwrite/prefs.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 613 Apr 21 18:28 /home/user/.appwrite/prefs.json

```
## Remediation

The file permissions should be set to 0600 (read-write access to the owner of the file only) upon creation, and checked each time the file is read to display a error message in case of too permissive permissions just like what the OpenSSH client does for SSH private keys.
