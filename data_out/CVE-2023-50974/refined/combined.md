AppWrite CLI - Too permissive access on preferences file

 [Raw](/SkypLabs/72ee00ecfa7d1a3494e2d69a24279c1d/raw/78c9cf74cb2872183a8b90b69905b81498b61f02/README.md)

[**README.md**](#file-readme-md)

# Appwrite CLI - Too permissive access on preferences file

## Description

When using the `login` command, the Appwrite CLI tool stores the credentials of the Appwrite user in the `~/.appwrite/prefs.json` file with 0644 as UNIX permissions. This is a security issue as it would allow any user of the local system to access those credentials.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install the latest version of the Appwrite CLI (2.0.2 to this day).
2. Log into an Appwrite instance using the `appwrite login` command.
3. Check the permissions of the preferences file.

In practice:

```
❯ appwrite -v
2.0.2

❯ appwrite login
? Enter your email admin@redacted.com
? Enter your password ****************
? Enter the endpoint of your Appwrite server https://appwrite.redacted.com/v1

✓ Success

❯ ll ~/.appwrite/prefs.json
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 613 Apr 21 18:28 /home/user/.appwrite/prefs.json

```
## Remediation

The file permissions should be set to 0600 (read-write access to the owner of the file only) upon creation, and checked each time the file is read to display a error message in case of too permissive permissions just like what the OpenSSH client does for SSH private keys.

# Installation

The [Appwrite Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli) is an application that allows you to interact with Appwrite to perform server-side tasks using your terminal. This includes creating and managing projects, managing resources (documents, files, users), creating and deploying Appwrite Functions, and other operations available through Appwrite's API.

## [Getting started](#getting-started)

The CLI is packaged both as an [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appwrite-cli) as well as a [standalone binary](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/releases/latest) for your operating system, making it completely dependency free, platform independent, and language agnostic.

If you plan to use the CLI to initialize new Appwrite Functions, ensure that [Git is installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your machine.

### [Install with npm](#install-with-npm)

If you have npm set up, run the command below to install the CLI.

Shell

```
npm install -g appwrite-cli

```
### [Install with script](#install-with-script)

For a completely dependency-free installation, the CLI also ships with a convenient installation script for your operating system

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Shell

```
brew install appwrite

```

or terminal

Shell

```
curl -sL https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh | bash

```

Using [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

Shell

```
iwr -useb https://appwrite.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex

```

or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

Shell

```
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/master/scoop/appwrite.json

```
Shell

```
curl -sL https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh | bash

```
## [Update your CLI](#update-your-cli)

 Shell

```
npm install -g appwrite-cli

```

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Shell

```
brew install appwrite

```

or terminal

Shell

```
curl -sL https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh | bash

```
Shell

```
iwr -useb https://appwrite.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex

```
Shell

```
curl -sL https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh | bash

```
Shell

```
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/master/scoop/appwrite.json

```
### [Verify installation](#verify-installation)

After the installation or the update is complete, you can verify the Appwrite CLI is available by checking its version number.

Shell

```
appwrite -v

```
## [Login](#login)

Before you can use the CLI, you need to login to your Appwrite account using

Shell

```
appwrite login

```

Add the --endpoint flag if you're using a self-hosted instance of Appwrite. This flag requires you to add the URL string you're using for your self-hosted instance after the --endpoint flag.

Shell

```
appwrite login --endpoint "<URL_HERE>"

```

You can log in to multiple accounts or change the **current** account by re-running the command.

## [Initialization](#initialization)

After you're logged in, the CLI needs to be initialized with your Appwrite project. You can initialize the CLI using:

Shell

```
appwrite init project

```

This will create your appwrite.json file, where you will configure your various services like collections, functions, teams, topics, and buckets.

JSON

```
{
    "projectId": "<PROJECT_ID>"
}

```

You can run your first CLI command after logging in. Try fetching information about your Appwrite project.

Shell

```
appwrite projects get --project-id "<PROJECT_ID>"

```
##### Self-signed certificates

By default, requests to domains with self-signed SSL certificates (or no certificates) are disabled. If you trust the domain, you can bypass the certificate validation using

Shell

```
appwrite client --self-signed true

```
### [Next steps](#next-steps)

You can use the CLI to create and deploy collections, functions, teams, topics, and buckets. Deployment commands allow you to configure your Appwrite project programmatically and replicate functions and collection schemas across Appwrite projects.

[Learn more about deployment](/docs/tooling/command-line/collections)

Besides utility commands, the CLI can be used to execute commands like a Server SDK.

[Find a full list of commands](/docs/tooling/command-line/commands)

You can choose to use the CLI in a headless and non-interactive mode without the need for config files or sessions. This is useful for CI or scripting use cases.

[Learn more about CI mode](/docs/tooling/command-line/non-interactive)

## [Help](#help)

If you get stuck anywhere, you can always use the help command to get the usage examples.

Shell

```
appwrite help

```
## [Configuration](#configuration)

At any point, if you would like to change your server's endpoint, project ID, or self-signed certificate acceptance, use the client command.

Shell

```
appwrite client --endpoint https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
appwrite client --key 23f24gwrhSDgefaY
appwrite client --self-signed true
appwrite client --reset // Resets your CLI configuration
appwrite client --debug // Prints your current configuration

```
## [Uninstall](#uninstall)

If you installed Appwrite CLI using NPM, you can use the following command to uninstall it.

Shell

```
npm uninstall -g appwrite-cli

```

If you installed the Appwrite CLI with brew or the installation script for your operating system, use the following command to uninstall it.

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Shell

```
brew uninstall appwrite

```

or terminal

Shell

```
rm -f /usr/local/bin/appwrite | bash

```

Using [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

Shell

```
$APPWRITE_INSTALL_DIR = Join-Path -Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA -ChildPath "Appwrite"; Remove-Item -Force -Path $APPWRITE_INSTALL_DIR

```

or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

Shell

```
scoop uninstall appwrite

```
Shell

```
rm -f /usr/local/bin/appwrite | bash

```

You can also remove the configuration, cookies, and API Keys the Appwrite CLI stored. To remove those, run the following command.

 Shell

```
rm -rf ~/.appwrite | bash

```

Using [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

Shell

```
$APPWRITE_CONFIG_DIR = Join-Path -Path $env:UserProfile -ChildPath ".appwrite"; Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -Path $APPWRITE_CONFIG_DIR

```

or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

Shell

```
appwrite client --reset

```
Shell

```
rm -rf ~/.appwrite | bash

```
