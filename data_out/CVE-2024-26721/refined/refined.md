Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an incorrect macro used to calculate the memory addresses of Display Stream Compression (DSC) Picture Parameter Set (PPS) registers in Intel graphics drivers. The macro, `DSCA_PPS` and `DSCC_PPS`, incorrectly assumed that the PPS register addresses incremented by a constant 4 bytes for all PPS numbers. However, after PPS 11, the address for PPS 12 increments by 12 bytes due to RC Buffer memory allocation. This discontinuity resulted in incorrect address calculations for PPS 12-16.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Address Calculation:** The macro `DSCA_PPS` and `DSCC_PPS` use a linear calculation `_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)` which is not valid for pps >= 12
- This leads to reading or writing to wrong memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DSC Corruption:** Incorrect read/writes to DSC PPS parameters due to the address miscalculation can corrupt the DSC stream, leading to display issues. This could cause visual artifacts, display flickering, or potentially other display related issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable by an attacker in the typical sense of remote code execution or privilege escalation.
- It is triggered by the system itself, while processing the DSC stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in the Intel graphics driver and would be triggered by the system whenever DSC is used with PPS number greater or equal to 12.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves modifying the macro to include the offset of 12 when the PPS number is greater than or equal to 12. The updated macros are `_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + ((pps) < 12 ? (pps) : (pps) + 12) * 4)` and `_MMIO(_DSCC_PPS_0 + ((pps) < 12 ? (pps) : (pps) + 12) * 4)`.
