[Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2022-030/&text=CERT@VDE has released a new advisory: VDE-2022-030: Lenze%3A%20Vulnerability%20in%20the%20OPC-UA%20authentification%20connection%20in%20the%20firmware)

#### ID

VDE-2022-030

#### Published

2022-07-11 12:00 (CEST)

#### Last update

2022-07-11 12:02 (CEST)

#### Vendor(s)

Lenze SE

#### Product(s)

| Article No° | Product Name | Affected Version(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | cabinet c520 | V01.07.00.2757 < V01.08.01.3021 |
|  | cabinet c550 | V01.07.00.2757 < V01.08.01.3021 |
|  | cabinet c750 | V01.07.00.2757 < V01.08.01.3021 |

#### Summary

The machine controller of the cabinet series include an OPC-UA server which uses an user management to authenticate clients via anonymous or user/password authentication. If the user/password authentication is selected, password verification is skipped upon second login. As a result, cases occur in which users can establish communication without correct authentication. This vulnerability is not located in the OPC-UA protocol or server, but in the interface to the products firmware.

This Security Advisory is only relevant for the following use cases:

• the user management has been activated on the machine controller (is deactivated by default)

• the OPC-UA Server is used

• Data are transferred via a symbol configuration (is not available by default)

#### CVE ID

[CVE-2022-2302](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2302)

#### Last Update:

Aug. 30, 2024, 9:29 a.m.

#### Severity

9.8

[(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1)

#### Weakness

Missing Critical Step in Authentication [(CWE-304)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/304.html)

#### Summary

Multiple Lenze products of the cabinet series skip the password verification upon second login. After a user has been logged on to the device once, a remote attacker can get full access without knowledge of the password.

#### Details

[nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2302)

---

#### Impact

The exploitation of the missing critical step in authentication may result in unauthorized use of the OPC-UA interface.

#### Solution

**Mitigation**

As part of a security strategy, Lenze SE recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

• Only use the products in a protected and controlled environment to minimize network impact and to ensure that they are inaccessible from outside.

• Use external firewalls to protect the automation system network and to separate it from other networks. Remark: One Measure should be to block port 4840 via the external firewall and open this port for authenticated access only.

• Use Virtual Private Networks (VPN) tunnels when remote access is required.

• Use IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) where possible to detect anomalies in the network.

• Activate and use user administration and password functions.

• Use encrypted communication links.

• Restrict access to both the development tools and their projects and the products of the automation system by physical means, operating system functions, etc.

• Protect the development tool by using the latest virus detection solutions.

• Use of certificate-based communication via the message security modes Sign or Sign&Encrypt and trust of the corresponding client certificates on the machine controller by the OPC-UA server. This can reduce the risk of exploiting this vulnerability.

**Remediation**

Install version V01.08.01.3021, which solves the identified security vulnerability.
