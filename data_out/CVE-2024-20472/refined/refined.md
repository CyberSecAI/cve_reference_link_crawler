- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software does not adequately validate user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerabilities (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized data from the database and make changes to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: By authenticating to the web-based management interface as an *Administrator* and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs *Administrator*-level privileges on the Cisco FMC Software.
