### CVE-2024-38596

Based on the provided content, the vulnerability described is a **data race** in the Linux kernel's AF_UNIX socket implementation.

**Root Cause:**
- The `unix_release_sock()` function uses `WRITE_ONCE` to atomically set the `sk->sk_shutdown` flag.
- The `unix_stream_sendmsg()` function reads the `sk->sk_shutdown` flag without atomic access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Data Race:** Concurrent access to the `sk->sk_shutdown` flag by `unix_release_sock()` (write) and `unix_stream_sendmsg()` (read) without proper synchronization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The data race leads to a KCSAN splat, which indicates a potential kernel crash. This can result in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Unpredictable Behavior:** Data races can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent operations on AF_UNIX sockets.
- A process closing a socket while another process is sending a message on the same socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and close AF_UNIX sockets, as well as send messages on them, which is generally available to local users.

**Technical Details:**
- The `sk->sk_shutdown` flag indicates whether a socket has been shut down.
- The `WRITE_ONCE` macro ensures that the write operation is atomic.
- The fix involves using `READ_ONCE` in `unix_stream_sendmsg()` to ensure atomic read of the `sk->sk_shutdown` flag.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue was previously addressed in commit e1d09c2c2f57 ("af_unix: Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown."), but that fix overlooked this specific path.
- The vulnerability affects multiple kernel versions.
- The provided patches use `READ_ONCE` to fix the data race.
