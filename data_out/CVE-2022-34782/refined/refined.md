**CVE-2022-34782**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `requests-plugin` does not perform permission checks correctly in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission check.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can view the list of pending requests, which should be restricted.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send an HTTP request to a specific endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires Overall/Read permission.
*   **Additional details**: The vulnerability is described as a repeat of a previous vulnerability with an ineffective fix (SECURITY-1995). The fixed version is 2.2.17 which now requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.
