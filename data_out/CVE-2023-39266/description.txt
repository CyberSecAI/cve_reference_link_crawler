A vulnerability in the ArubaOS-Switch web management interface could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface provided certain configuration options are present. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a victim's browser in the context of the affected interface.
