Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5665

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Options Exposure

**Affected Software:** Login/Signup Popup ( Inline Form + Woocommerce ) WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:** 2.7.1 - 2.7.2

**Root Cause:** The `export_settings` function within the plugin's `class-xoo-admin-settings.php` file lacks a capability check. This function is intended to export plugin settings, but due to the missing check, it can be accessed by any authenticated user, even those with low-level privileges (like Subscriber).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check within the `export_settings` function. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive plugin data.
*   **Arbitrary Options Exposure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary WordPress options from the database by manipulating the `options` parameter sent to the `export_settings` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary options from the WordPress database, potentially exposing sensitive information such as API keys, access tokens, email addresses, or other configuration data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The exposed information could be used as a stepping stone for more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests to the WordPress site's AJAX endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an account on the affected WordPress site.
*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker only needs to be an authenticated user, even a subscriber.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the AJAX endpoint used by the plugin and the parameters it expects.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code resides in `includes/xoo-framework/admin/class-xoo-admin-settings.php` within the plugin.
*   The `export_settings` function does not use `current_user_can()` or similar authorization checks before retrieving and sending option values.
*   The function retrieves options based on the `$_POST['options']` parameter.
*   The patch in version 2.7.3 adds a `current_user_can( $this->capability )` check to the `export_settings` function, preventing unauthorized users from accessing this function.

**Patch Information**
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.3
* The fix involved adding a capability check `if( !current_user_can( $this->capability ) ) return;` to the beginning of the `export_settings` function
*  A nonce check was added at the start of the function
