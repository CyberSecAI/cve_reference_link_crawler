Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from client-side enforcement of server-side security measures related to customer report features in FortiPortal. This means that the application relies on client-side controls to prevent access to unauthorized data, rather than enforcing these checks on the server.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The specific weakness is **CWE-602 - Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security**. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended access controls by manipulating HTTP requests, since the server isn't performing adequate authorization checks.
*  **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with a customer account can potentially access other customers' information by crafting malicious HTTP requests. The impact is limited to improper access control, specifically unauthorized disclosure of information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests. This means an attacker can directly manipulate the HTTP requests sent to the server to request access to data that they should not have access to.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a valid customer account to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need any elevated privileges or to be an administrator.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in FortiPortal versions 6.0.0 through 6.0.14.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 4.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to FortiPortal 6.0.15 or a later version.
