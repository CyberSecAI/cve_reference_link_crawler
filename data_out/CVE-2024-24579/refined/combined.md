# Tar path traversal in stereoscope when processing OCI tar archives

Moderate

[wagoodman](/wagoodman)
published
GHSA-hpxr-w9w7-g4gv
Jan 31, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/anchore/stereoscope
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.0.1

## Patched versions

0.0.1

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to craft an OCI tar archive that, when stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function, the `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider` struct, or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function express this vulnerability.

### Patches

Patched in v0.0.1

### Workarounds

If you are using the OCI archive as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an [OCI layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md) by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the unarchived directory to stereoscope.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
