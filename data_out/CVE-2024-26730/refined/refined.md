The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26730.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in the number of temperature configuration registers compared to the total number of temperature registers within the `nct6775` hardware monitoring driver in the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is a global out-of-bounds access in the `nct6775_probe` function. Specifically, the code was accessing `reg_temp_config` array using an index `i` without ensuring that `i` was within the valid bounds of `num_reg_temp_config`, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The out-of-bounds access can lead to memory corruption. The provided commit log mentions "access errors reported if KASAN is enabled." While the immediate impact is primarily a KASAN error detection, the underlying memory corruption could potentially lead to system instability or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the initialization of the `nct6775` driver (during `nct6775_probe` function call). No specific user interaction is required, it can be triggered when the driver is loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need any special privileges or position, only the ability to load the `nct6775` driver.
