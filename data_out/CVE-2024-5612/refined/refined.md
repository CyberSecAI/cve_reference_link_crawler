Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-5612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping within the 'eael\_lightbox\_open\_btn\_icon' parameter of the Lightbox & Modal widget in the Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the plugin's database or settings. These scripts are then executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts, which are then executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected page.
*   **Account Takeover:** Depending on the injected script, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim, including stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited through the 'eael\_lightbox\_open\_btn\_icon' parameter when configuring the Lightbox & Modal widget.
*   An authenticated attacker (Contributor level access or higher) can inject malicious code through the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WordPress site, with at least "Contributor" level access
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the settings of the Lightbox & Modal widget within the Elementor editor.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin up to and including 5.8.15.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 5.8.16.
*   The Wordfence vulnerability database provides a detailed record of this issue, including a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium).
*   The changelog provided in the first content does not directly refer to the security fix mentioned in CVE-2024-5612, it only mentions "Security Enhancement" in general terms within the changelogs of both the free and pro versions, so this is additional information not contained in the vendor provided change log.

In summary, CVE-2024-5612 is a stored XSS vulnerability in the Essential Addons for Elementor Pro plugin that allows authenticated users with Contributor access or higher to inject malicious JavaScript code through the Lightbox & Modal widget.
