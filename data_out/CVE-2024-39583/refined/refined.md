- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm in Dell PowerScale InsightIQ.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker with remote access could exploit this vulnerability leading to Elevation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have remote network access and does not need to authenticate. The attack complexity is high.
