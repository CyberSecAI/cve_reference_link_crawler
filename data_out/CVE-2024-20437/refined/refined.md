- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the CLI of an affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.
- **Attack vectors**: Persuading an already authenticated user to follow a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link, and the targeted user must be authenticated to the web interface and click the crafted link. The device must have the HTTP Server feature enabled and the `service internal` configuration command enabled.
