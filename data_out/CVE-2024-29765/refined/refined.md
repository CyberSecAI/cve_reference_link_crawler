- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Aparat for WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is susceptible to XSS, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which execute when users visit the affected website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the website which would then be executed by other users visiting the site. The content specifies the need of "Contributor" privilege, which hints towards the attacker needing to be an authenticated user, although it doesn't explicitly state that.
