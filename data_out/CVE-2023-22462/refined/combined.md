# Stored XSS in Text plugin

Moderate

[vtorosyan](/vtorosyan)
published
GHSA-7rqg-hjwc-6mjf
Mar 1, 2023

## Package

github.com/grafana/grafana

## Affected versions

>=9.2.0 <9.2.10 >=9.3.0 <9.3.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Description

On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core plugin "Text".

The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana's database.

### Impact

An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. later, an another user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on "Markdown" or "HTML" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

### Impacted versions

Grafana versions between 9.2.0 and 9.2.10. and between 9.3.0 and 9.3.4

### Solutions and mitigations

Update your Grafana instance.

## Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com. This address can be used for all of Grafana Labs' open source and commercial products (including, but not limited to Grafana, Grafana Cloud, Grafana Enterprise, and grafana.com). We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address. We would prefer that you encrypt your message to us by using our PGP key. The key fingerprint is

F988 7BEA 027A 049F AE8E 5CAA D125 8932 BE24 C5CA

The key is available from keyserver.ubuntu.com.

## Security announcements

We maintain a [security category](https://community.grafana.com/c/support/security-announcements) on our blog, where we will always post a summary, remediation, and mitigation details for any patch containing security fixes.

You can also subscribe to our [RSS feed](https://grafana.com/tags/security/index.xml).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

## Stored XSS in TraceView panel (CVE-2023-0594)

### Summary

During an internal audit of Grafana on January 30, a member of the engineering team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the `TraceView` panel.

The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because the value of a span’s attributes/resources were not properly sanitized, and this will be rendered when the span’s attributes/resources are expanded.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.3 High (CVSS:7.3/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](/cloud/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt).

### Impact

An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change the value of a trace view visualization to contain JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with an Editor role can change to a known password for a user with an Admin role and, with the Admin role permissions, can execute malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

### Impacted versions

All installations for Grafana versions <8.5.21, <9.2.13, and <9.3.8.

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address CVE-2023-0594, please upgrade your Grafana instances. As an alternative, you can enable the [Content-Security-Policy option](/docs/grafana/next/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-security-hardening/#security-headers).

## Stored XSS in geomap panel plugin via attribution (CVE-2023-0507)

### Summary

During an internal audit of Grafana on January 25, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core geomap plugin.

The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because map attributions weren’t properly sanitized, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the Grafana instance.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.3 High (CVSS:7.3/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](/cloud/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt).

### Impact

An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include a map attribution containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with an Editor role can change to a known password for a user with an Admin role and, with the Admin role permissions, can execute malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

### Impacted versions

All installations for Grafana versions <8.5.21, <9.2.13, and <9.3.8.

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address CVE-2023-0507, please upgrade your Grafana instances. As an alternative, you can enable the [Content-Security-Policy option](/docs/grafana/next/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-security-hardening/#security-headers).

## Stored XSS in text panel plugin (CVE-2023-22462)

### Summary

During an internal audit of Grafana on January 1, a member of the security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core text plugin.

The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was possible due to React’s render cycle that will pass through the unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle, the HTML is cleaned up and saved in Grafana’s database.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Medium (CVSS:6.4/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](/cloud/?pg=blog&plcmt=body-txt).

### Impact

An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order to change a text panel to include JavaScript. Later, another user needs to edit the same text panel, and click on **Markdown** or **HTML** for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege escalation is possible, where a user with an Editor role can change to a known password for a user with an Admin role and, with the Admin role permissions, can execute malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard.

### Impacted versions

All installations for Grafana versions <9.2.10 and <9.3.4

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address CVE-2023-22462, please upgrade your Grafana instances. As an alternative, you can enable the [Content-Security-Policy option](/docs/grafana/next/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-security-hardening/#security-headers).
