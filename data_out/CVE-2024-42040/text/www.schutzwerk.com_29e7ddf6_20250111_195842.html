Summary
=======
Das U-Boot (U-Boot) is a widespread open-source boot loader used in embedded devices to perform various low-level hardware initialization tasks and boot the device's operating system kernel. During an embedded security assessment, we identified a buffer overread vulnerability (CWE-126) in the DHCP implementation of U-Boot that could leak memory onto the network. The amount of leaked data depends on the later use of the hostname, DNS-server IP, gateway IP, or other DHCP options in unencrypted network traffic. The vulnerability has been present since the "Initial revision" commit (3861aa5) from 2002.
Risk
====
An attacker with access to the local network and faster response times than the default DHCP server can trigger a memory leak by responding with malicious DHCP offers to a vulnerable U-Boot DHCP client. In the current implementation, only 4 Bytes of data can be leaked via gateway or DNS server address. When net\_hostname would be used and also sent over the network, 32 Bytes could be retrieved. When the bp\_vend field is filled with zeroes besides the magic number, it could also lead the loop to continue outside the packet to process data. This can cause further data to be leaked when values like 0x1,0x3,0x6, and 0x12 are present in that data. When further vulnerabilities can be found they might be combined to achieve further harmful impact to the system.
Description
===========
After U-Boot sends an initial DHCP request, the vulnerable bootp\_handler gets registered as a callback for incoming packets. The handler first checks if the received packet is the expected reply packet. If VENDOR\_MAGIC is in the first four bytes of bp->bp\_vend, the address of bp->bp\_vend[4] and the total length of the packet is passed to bootp\_process\_vendor (net/bootp.c:381) without being reduced to len-(offsetof(struct bootp\_hdr,bp\_vend)+4). There is also a missing check whether the first four bytes of bp->pb\_vend[] are in range of the packet length before retrieving them to compare with htonl(VENDOR\_MAGIC).
In bootp\_process\_vendor, an incorrect end address is then calculated based on the full packet length (net/bootp.c:312) instead of the rest of the bp\_vend buffer size. Then, the function increases the ext pointer until it no longer points to zero bytes within the too-long buffer range or when one byte is 0xff. When a none-zero value is discovered the ext pointer is passed to bootp\_process\_vendor\_field.
In bootp\_process\_vendor\_field, the de-referenced value of the passed pointer is used to select the case for processing the field, and its length is de-referenced from ext+1. Based on the selected case, values are then copied to variables and buffers like net\_gateway.s\_addr or net\_hostname from ext+2. The copied lengths are only limited by the size of their destination. The end of the bp\_vend structure or the end of the packet is never checked in bootp\_process\_vendor\_field.
This allows an attacker, who can respond to DHCP requests, to craft a packet that causes the code to copy the contents of the target's RAM directly following the received packet into parameters. These parameters are sent via the network during later use, leaking the RAM content to the attacker.
Solution/Mitigation
===================
We recommend providing an adequate length to bootp\_process\_vendor to prevent the while loop from stepping outside the packet frame and checking in bootp\_process\_vendor\_field if the copied data is still within the packet structure's range.
