Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formIPMacBindDel` function of the Tenda W15EV1.0 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `IPMacBindIndex` parameter from a POST request is passed to the `formIPMacBindDel` function.
- The value of `IPMacBindIndex` is copied to a local buffer (`indexs`) using `strcpy` without any bounds checking.
- The size of the `indexs` buffer is limited, and a user-provided input for `IPMacBindIndex` can exceed this capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a stack buffer overflow, which can result in:
    - Denial of service (crashing the device).
    - Potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/delIpMacBind` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to control the `IPMacBindIndex` parameter to overflow the buffer on the stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router.
- This likely requires being on the same network as the device or having some network access to it.

**Technical Details:**
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `indexSet` value (which is derived from `IPMacBindIndex` parameter) into a smaller sized buffer `indexs` without any bounds check.
- The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code provided demonstrates sending a POST request with a long string of 'a' characters as the value of `IPMacBindIndex`, which triggers the buffer overflow.

**Affected Version:**
- Tenda W15EV1.0 V15.11.0.14
