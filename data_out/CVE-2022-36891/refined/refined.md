Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36891:

**CVE-2022-36891**

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Root Cause:** The Deployer Framework Plugin does not perform a permission check when accessing an HTTP endpoint that reads deployment logs.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization leading to unauthorized information disclosure.
*  **Impact:** An attacker with `Item/Read` permission can read deployment logs.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to the Jenkins instance, specifically to an HTTP endpoint of the Deployer Framework Plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to have `Item/Read` permission in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The Deployer Framework Plugin in Jenkins does not properly check user permissions before allowing access to an endpoint that displays deployment logs. This means that an attacker with the `Item/Read` permission, which is a relatively low-level permission, can read these logs, potentially gaining access to sensitive information about deployments.
