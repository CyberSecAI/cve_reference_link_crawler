[`79a8d78`](/notable/notable-insiders/commit/79a8d78a742fee5e71a0f6d580b278ac4293e684)

## Version 1.9.0-beta.8

### New Features

* New setting: note.autorename.enabled, for turning off automatic renames of notes
* Treating `*.qmd` files as Markdown files
* Markdown: added support for syntax highlighting core blocks written in R's flavor of Markdown

### Improvements

* Updated Electron to v18.0.3
* Zen mode: added a 500ms delay before flyover sections are opened
* Mermaid: inverting colors with dark themes, as a probably better default
* Improved smoothness during window resizes

### Bug Fixes

* Security: ensuring Electron's "webSecurity" option is active, though CORS is still fully disabled
* Security: ensuring executable files are not opened when clicking on a link
* Layout: fixed an issue that caused it to stop working whenever the columns it handled changed
* Ensuring the sidebar and the panel can never be scrolled horizontally
* HTML Sanitizer: ensuring it doesn't break vertical alignment of text inside SVGs
* Pikchr: ensuring the standard "sans-serif" font family is used
* Table of contents: ensuring it's not rendered if it's inside an heading, as that would cause an infinite loop
* Global search: fixed an issue that caused an updated note to disappear from the list of results if the query was empty
