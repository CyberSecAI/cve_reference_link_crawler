{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper integrity checks on the `/etc/mtab` file during the Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA) process. By manipulating the `/etc/fstab` and `/etc/mtab` files, an attacker can prevent the mounting of temporary file systems (TMPFS) for `/root`, `/tmp`, and `/var`, allowing for persistent modifications and code execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate PBA integrity checks, specifically the omission of `/etc/mtab` validation.",
      "Vulnerability in the mounting process by manipulating symlinks to prevent tmpfs from mounting",
      "Lack of file attribute validation during PBA checks (only content hashes checked)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can bypass the PBA integrity validation, achieve code execution as root, recover the disk encryption key, and decrypt the Windows operating system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the ATM.",
       "Manipulating system files in the unencrypted Linux partition during the boot process"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the ATM and ability to modify files within the unencrypted Linux partition."
  },
  "additional_notes": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain a persistent foothold on the ATM system, bypassing intended security measures, and ultimately leading to the compromise of the encrypted Windows environment. The attack involves manipulating symlinks to prevent the mounting of temporary file systems, a critical step in the system's boot process."
