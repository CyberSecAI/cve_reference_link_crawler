  "CVE-2024-34581": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The XML-Signature Syntax and Processing specification (RFC 3275) includes a recommended but optional mechanism by which to retrieve key information from a remote URL. An [XML Signature Best Practices Working Group Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-xmldsig-bestpractices-20130411/) dated 2013-04-11 points out SSRF-related security concerns in Best Practice 7. [XML Signature Syntax and Processing Version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/#sec-RetrievalMethod) (dated 2015-07-23) notes that \"The KeyInfoReference element is preferred over use of RetrievalMethod as it avoids use of Transform child elements that introduce security risk and implementation challenges.\"",
    "root_cause": "The XML-Signature Syntax and Processing specification (RFC 3275) includes a recommended but optional mechanism (RetrievalMethod) by which to retrieve key information from a remote URL, which can lead to SSRF.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Implementations of the XML Signature specification may be vulnerable to SSRF attacks by processing untrusted URLs in the RetrievalMethod element.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious XML document with a crafted RetrievalMethod element that points to an internal or external resource."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted XML document with malicious URI in the RetrievalMethod element, which is a part of the KeyInfo element.",
        "additional_details": "The document provides more detail than the official CVE description by linking the vulnerability to the specific part of the XML Signature specification and by mentioning related security guidance (Best Practice 7 in XML Signature Best Practices Working Group Note)."
