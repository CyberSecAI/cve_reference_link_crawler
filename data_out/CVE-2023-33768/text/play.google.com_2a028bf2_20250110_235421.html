## About this app

*arrow\_forward*With the Wemo App, you can control all of your Wemo from anywhere in the world on your Android devices.

Wemo is the simple way to a smarter home. Download the Wemo app and control your lights, appliances, or a whole room from your couch, coffee shop, or the Caribbean.

HELLO HANDS-FREE CONTROL

Pair your Wemo Mini, Light Switch, Insight, or Switch with Amazon Echo or Google Home and you can control your lights, your appliances, or a whole room without having to lift a finger.

NEVER COME HOME TO A DARK HOUSE

You can schedule your lights to be on during specific hours, or simply sync lights and devices to the sun automatically.

LOOK LIKE YOU’RE HOME EVEN WHEN YOU’RE NOT

Enable the “Away Mode” feature and your lights will turn on and off randomly, making it look like you’re home even when you’re not.

December 28, 2024They are too much trouble to own. I do not have time nor do I want to make the time to troubleshoot products that should be easy to use. Also, the link in the app that says contact us doesn't even work. Update 8.23.20 won't stay connected for weeks on end. I keep resetting it but it keeps losing connection. Finally there was an update and it's kept a connection for 2 days. We'll see. Btw. I have kasa lights switches hardwired & plugs that work fine.Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWFDEjCVdiE1s0-9I3pz1MpNj5vultTNcWWwUvzwGnnkk1LX4wM=s32-rw)Dave Smart*more\_vert*

December 25, 2024I would like to see support for custom icons, as many of the online screenshots hint. Update: they added support for custom icons/images. Some WEMO fall off the network for no reason. Getting them to rejoin is nearly impossible for 2 of them. Try after try after try. Range to the AP is the same as others. Firmware was all up to date. When they do fall off, why don't they reconnect themselves?Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQyIrXInT3FCNXT5P_ngv0KshI5UWEnCqyeIJ0bcmfFFYVoFOX=s32-rw)edward powell*more\_vert*

December 30, 2024Wow. There was a time when I really thought this app was great. Now I no longer can get it to even work. Like everyone else I have to believe it was the last update. Since then the app no longer works with Alexa. It intermittently works on its own but not reliable. I have over 30 of these devices in my home and most of them are not working. I've had to reset switches just to be able to have access to them. This really sucks. I invested a lot of time, money into a product I may not be able to use17 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
