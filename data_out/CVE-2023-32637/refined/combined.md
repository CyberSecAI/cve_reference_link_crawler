# JVN#35897618 GBrowse vulnerable to unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types Critical

## Overview

GBrowse is vulnerable to unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types.

## Products Affected

* GBrowse

The reporter verifies that version 1.70 is vulnerable to this issue, and that version 2.56 restricts uploading non-GFF formatted files. This indicates that the file validation mechanism may have been implemented since version 2.x. However, the actual versions have not been confirmed.

## Description

GBrowse provided by Generic Model Organism Database Project is a web-based genome browser. GBrowse allows the users to upload their own data in several file formats (see "[GBrowse User Uploads](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_User_Uploads)").

The affected versions of GBrowse accept files with any formats uploaded ([CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)), and place them in the area accessible through unauthenticated web requests.

The reporter states that attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been observed.

## Impact

Anyone who can upload files through the product may execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Solution

**Stop using the product and Switch to the successor**

The developer states that GBrowse is no longer supported and recommends using the successor product [JBrowse2](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/).
