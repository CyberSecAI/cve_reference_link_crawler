- Root cause of vulnerability: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function of the Tenda AC10U v1.0 Firmware V15.03.06.49.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is caused by the usage of `strcpy` to copy user-controlled input `schedStartTime` to a fixed-size buffer `wlan_switch->begin_time` of 25 bytes, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is larger.
- Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered through a POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint by providing an overly large value for the `schedStartTime` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router, implying network access, which could be from a LAN or, depending on the router's configuration, from the WAN.
