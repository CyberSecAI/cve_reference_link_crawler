- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerabilities exist in GoAhead Web Server when compiled with the `ME_GOAHEAD_REPLACE_MALLOC` flag, and a memory notifier is not implemented to handle allocation failures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL Pointer Dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can send malicious requests to trigger a crash and cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious requests sent over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated, needing only to send malicious requests to the vulnerable server.
