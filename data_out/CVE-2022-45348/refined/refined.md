- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The amr users plugin is vulnerable to CSV Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows for the injection of malicious formulas into exported CSV files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could craft formulas that, when opened in spreadsheet software, could be exploited to execute commands or gain access to the victim's computer.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user exports data to a CSV file that contains malicious formulas.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A malicious actor needs to be able to insert malicious formulas, likely through user-controlled data within the plugin, which would then be exported in a CSV file. The attacker can be any user with subscriber-level privileges as that is mentioned as a required privilege.
