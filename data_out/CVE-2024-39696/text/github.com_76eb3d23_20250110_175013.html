# Precompiles exploit of smart contract account and vesting

Critical

[hanchon](/hanchon)
published
GHSA-q6hg-6m9x-5g9c
Jul 5, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/evmos/evmos
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 18.0.1

## Patched versions

>= 19.0.0

## Description

### Summary

This advisory board aims to describe two vulnerabilities found in the Evmos codebase:

* *Authorization check on the fundVestingAccount*: unauthorized spend of funds.

### Details

#### Authorization check on the fundVestingAccount

With the current implementation, a user can create a vesting account with a 3rd party account (EOA or contract) as funder. Then, this user can create an authorization for the contract.CallerAddress, this is the authorization checked in the code. But the funds are taken from the funder address provided in the message. Consequently, the user can fund a vesting account with a 3rd party account without its permission. The funder address can be any address, so this vulnerability can be used to drain all the accounts in the chain.

### Severity

Based on [ImmuneFi Severity Classification System](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13332717597585-Severity-Classification-System) the severity was evaluated to Critical since the attack could have lead to direct loss of funds.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in versions >=V19.0.0

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-39696

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
