{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow vulnerability exists within the storport.sys driver due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before buffer allocation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
