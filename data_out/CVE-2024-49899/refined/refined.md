{
  "CVE-2024-49899": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Variables used as denominators were not initialized, potentially leading to division by zero errors.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized variables used as denominators in division operations, leading to potential divide-by-zero errors.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A divide-by-zero error could cause the system to crash or behave unexpectedly.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by display configurations that result in the use of uninitialized denominator variables.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to manipulate display settings to trigger the vulnerable code path. This might involve modifying display parameters via user-level software or potentially through malicious kernel extensions."
