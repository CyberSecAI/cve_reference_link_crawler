- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation for the `ID` and `lgid` parameters in the `SEMCMS_Banner.php` file, specifically on lines 32 and 69. These parameters are directly included in SQL queries without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. The provided filter function is insufficient to block all malicious SQL injection attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or other database-related attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request by manipulating the `ID` and `lgid` parameters in the URL of `SEMCMS_Banner.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require an account on the system. They need to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `SEMCMS_Banner.php` file, with manipulated parameters.
