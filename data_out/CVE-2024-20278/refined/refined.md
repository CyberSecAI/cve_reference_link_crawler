- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input within the NETCONF feature of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from inadequate input validation, specifically when processing data received via NETCONF. This allows for crafted input to be processed in a way that elevates privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to elevate their privileges from *Administrator* to *root* on the affected device. This grants the attacker full control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending crafted input over NETCONF to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated and have remote access to the device with the NETCONF feature enabled. They need to have at least *Administrator* level privileges to begin with.
