# Unintentional exposure of environment variables to subprocesses

Low

[oioki](/oioki)
published
GHSA-g92j-qhmh-64v2
Jul 18, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry-sdk
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.8.0

## Description

### Impact

The bug in Sentry's Python SDK <2.8.0 results in the unintentional exposure of environment variables to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting.

### Details

In Python's `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls, like in this example:

```
>>> subprocess.check_output(["env"], env={"TEST":"1"})
b'TEST=1\n'

```

If you'd want to not pass any variables, you can set an empty dict:

```
>>> subprocess.check_output(["env"], env={})
b''

```

However, the bug in Sentry SDK <2.8.0 causes **all environment variables** to be passed to the subprocesses when `env={}` is set, unless the Sentry SDK's [Stdlib](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/#stdlib) integration is disabled. The Stdlib integration is enabled by default.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in [#3251](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251) and the fix released in [sentry-sdk==2.8.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/2.8.0). The fix was also backported to [sentry-sdk==1.45.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.1).

### Workarounds

We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if it's not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, there are two options:

1. In your application, replace `env={}` with the minimal dict `env={"EMPTY_ENV":"1"}` or similar.

OR

2. Disable Stdlib integration:

```
import sentry_sdk

# Should go before sentry_sdk.init
sentry_sdk.integrations._DEFAULT_INTEGRATIONS.remove("sentry_sdk.integrations.stdlib.StdlibIntegration")

sentry_sdk.init(...)

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
