This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fix(integrations): don't send full env to subprocess ([#3251](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/3251))

```
During the arguments modification to `subprocess.Popen.__init__`,
an explicitly empty environment of `{}` is incorrectly confused with a `None`
environment. This causes sentry to pass the entire environment of the
parent process instead of sending just the injected environment variables.

Fix it by only replacing the environment with `os.environ` if the variable
is None, and not just falsy.
