### @sentrivana **[sentrivana](/sentrivana)** commented [Jul 5, 2024](#issue-2392971347)

During the arguments modification to `subprocess.Popen.__init__`, an explicitly empty environment of `{}` is incorrectly confused with a `None` environment. This causes sentry to pass the entire environment of the parent process instead of sending just the injected environment variables.

Fix it by only replacing the environment with `os.environ` if the variable is None, and not just falsy.

Sorry, something went wrong.
