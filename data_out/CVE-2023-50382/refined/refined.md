The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for CVE-2023-50382 and two related CVEs (CVE-2023-50381, CVE-2023-50383), all concerning OS command injection vulnerabilities in the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK's boa webserver.

**CVE-2023-50382:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `formWsc` API of the `boa` web server used in the Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK. Specifically, the `peerPin` parameter, when passed to the API, is used to construct an OS command without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** OS command injection due to insufficient input validation. The `peerPin` parameter is directly used in the command `echo <peerPin> > /var/wps_peer_pin` executed via the `system()` function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the target device by injecting malicious commands into the `peerPin` parameter. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected device, including data exfiltration, modification of settings, denial of service, or inclusion in a botnet.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the network via HTTP requests to the `/boafrm/formWsc` API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. Authentication to the web interface is needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `setPIN` parameter is set, and when the `MIB_WLAN_WSC_DISABLE` variable, stored in flash, is set to `1` (WPS is disabled).
*   The report provides a detailed code analysis of the vulnerable function and the flow leading to the command injection, including the specific line of code where the injection occurs (line `[11]`).
*   The report provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit using `curl` demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability, causing the device to reboot using a command injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in Realtek rtl819x Jungle SDK v3.4.11 and LevelOne WBR-6013 RER4\_A\_v3411b\_2T2R\_LEV\_09\_170623.
*   The report also details the other two related vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-50381 and CVE-2023-50383) within the same function which are triggered by different parameters (`targetAPSsid` and `localPin`).
*   The report mentions that Realtek has provided updates to their customers, but LevelOne declined to patch the issue.
