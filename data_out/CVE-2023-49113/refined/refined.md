Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-49113:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text explicitly mentions `CVE-2023-49113` as "Sensitive Data Stored Insecurely" and links it to the fix `SAS-6854, SAS-6855, SAS-6858, and SAS-6859` which were addressed in the 2024-02-06 release. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Kiuwan Local Analyzer (KLA), a Java application, contained several hard-coded secrets stored in plain text format within its JAR files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:**  Specifically, a GitHub username and password were found within the `InsightServicesConfig.properties` file located in the `lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar` JAR file.
    *  **Encryption Key Exposure:** The encryption key used for scan results was found in the `es/als/security/Encryptor.properties` file, also within `lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Compromise of Scan Results:** The exposed encryption key could potentially allow an attacker to decrypt scan results, thus compromising their confidentiality.
    *   **Potential Access to GitHub Account:** The exposed Github credentials could grant an attacker access to a related Github account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker who gains access to the Kiuwan Local Analyzer's installation directory or the KLA's JAR files can extract these hardcoded secrets.
    *   **Further exploitation:** If combined with other vulnerabilities, such as the XXE vulnerability also mentioned, access to the file system and these credentials could have been obtained.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to KLA Filesystem:** An attacker would need the ability to access the file system where the Kiuwan Local Analyzer is installed, specifically its JAR files.
    *   **Ability to Exploit Other Vulnerabilities:** In conjunction with vulnerabilities like XXE, an attacker could potentially extract the keys from a vulnerable Kiuwan instance

**Additional Notes:**
