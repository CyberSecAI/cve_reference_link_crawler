The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Canteen Management System, specifically in the `edituser.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to validate user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in `edituser.php`, before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/validation.
- The `id` parameter in `edituser.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive data or modify database content.
- The attacker demonstrated the ability to retrieve a hash of a value from the database, indicating a successful SQL injection.
- Blind SQL time-based injection is also possible, further expanding the potential impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP GET request to `edituser.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- It is implied that the attacker requires some level of authentication to access the vulnerable page since the POC states "After logging in, use the Edit User function".
