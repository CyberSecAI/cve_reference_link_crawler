  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bagisto v1.5.0 application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The delete address functionality lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can force a victim to unknowingly delete their address by clicking a specially crafted link or opening a malicious HTML page while being logged into the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious link or HTML page containing a request to delete a user's address. This link or page is then delivered to the victim (e.g., via email or other methods).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to click the malicious link or open the malicious page. The attacker does not need direct access to the application."
