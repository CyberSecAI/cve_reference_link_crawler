## **How does the Human Resource Management System work?**

This **Human Resource Management System project** has 2 modules which are the **Admin Panel** and the **Employee Side**. These 2 sides of the site have different features and functionalities according to their user roles.

The **Admin Panel** is the side of the system where the system administrators are the only ones who can access it. This is where the HR Department or Staff manages the list of employees of the company. The system administrators are the ones who can accept or deny the leave applications of the employees. Here, administrators can list, add, edit, and delete data on the master list of Positions, Countries, States, and Cities.

The **Employee-Side** is the side of the system that employees can only access. This side allows the employees' to create new leave applications. After they create leave applications, their pending, accepted, and denied applications are listed on the leave application page. On the dashboard page, the logged-in employee can see his/her leave application summary which is the total number of pending and accepted applications only.

Both users can update their system password.

### [Some security issues](/comment/99182#comment-99182)

Hi,
Today I tested this application in my lab environment. I noticed some security issues. I've no idea how I could inform you about my findings. Is there a possibility to share them so you could fix them in a new release?
Cheers
eMVee
