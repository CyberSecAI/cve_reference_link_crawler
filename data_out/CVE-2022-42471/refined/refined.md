- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers, potentially leading to unauthorized code or command execution.
- **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated, remote attacker can inject crafted input containing CRLF sequences into HTTP headers via the FortiWeb API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and be able to make remote calls to the FortiWeb API.
