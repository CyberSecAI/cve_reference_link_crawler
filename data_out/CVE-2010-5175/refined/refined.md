{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how antivirus software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks to monitor system calls. By exploiting this timing vulnerability, malicious code can bypass the security checks performed by antivirus software.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition in kernel-mode hooks",
      "Inability of one thread to track simultaneously running threads in multi-core processors"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploitation is that malware can bypass antivirus software detection, allowing it to install and execute malicious code on the targeted system. This can lead to various attacks, including data theft, system compromise, and further malware installation. It can even be used to disable the AV software.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malware is initially loaded as benign code that passes AV checks.",
       "A race condition on multi-core systems is exploited.",
      "The benign code is then swapped with a malicious payload just before execution."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to run a binary on the targeted PC. This could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities in software like Adobe Reader or Java, or through social engineering to convince the user to execute the malicious code."
