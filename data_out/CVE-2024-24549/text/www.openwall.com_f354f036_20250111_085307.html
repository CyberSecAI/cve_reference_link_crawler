Subject: CVE-2024-24549: Apache Tomcat: HTTP/2 header handling DoS

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M16
- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.18
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.85
- Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 through 8.5.98

Description:

Denial of Service due to improper input validation vulnerability for
HTTP/2 requests in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 request, if
the request exceeded any of the configured limits for headers, the
associated HTTP/2 stream was not reset until after all of the headers
had been processed.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1
through 11.0.0-M16, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.18, from 9.0.0-M1
through 9.0.85, from 8.5.0 through 8.5.98.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M17, 10.1.19, 9.0.86
or 8.5.99 which fix the issue.
