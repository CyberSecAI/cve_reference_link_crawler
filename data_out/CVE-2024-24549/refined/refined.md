Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-24549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in Apache Tomcat's handling of HTTP/2 requests.
*   Specifically, when an HTTP/2 request exceeds configured limits for headers, the associated HTTP/2 stream is not reset until after all headers are processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation of HTTP/2 header size limits.
*   **Denial of Service:** This leads to a DoS vulnerability as excessive headers can tie up resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). By sending a crafted HTTP/2 request with excessive headers, an attacker can cause resource exhaustion, rendering the Tomcat server unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is over the network via HTTP/2 requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the affected Tomcat server. No authentication or special privileges are needed.

**Summary of key information:**
*   The vulnerability is a DoS via HTTP/2 header handling
*   It is caused by improper input validation.
*   It affects multiple versions of Apache Tomcat (8.5.x, 9.0.x, 10.1.x and 11.0.x)
*   Successful exploitation leads to resource exhaustion.
*   The attack can be performed remotely.
