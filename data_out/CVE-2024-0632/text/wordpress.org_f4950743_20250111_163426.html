Main issue is that it won’t display on mobile version of the site, which is not good nowadays and there isn’t a tick box for such to be enabled. Needs sorting out. Thanks.

I pampa, me and my team were the ones who sent you some ideias and designs for a new flag pack a few months ago, since then I’ve started using your plugin on one more client site. I’d say that this is probably the fastest and most performant translator plugin in the directory, and that’s what makes it special. It’s modern, it feels really nice to use with gutenberg. Unlike all the other plugins out there.
For the Pro version my wish is the following:
1. Make it so we can create custom urls from an automatic translation
2. Make it simple on how to index these results on google
3. Make it simple, simple, simple. Please don’t add bloat or to much complexity.
Hope all is well.

I don’t understand why this is called ” automatic”
When you Visit the website from a different language the website does not switch to it. User have to select the language from the widget.
Did I miss something ?

This plugin is a good solution for someone looking for auto machine translation using Google’s free translation service, but it has the same shortcomings as other similar plugins which limits its usefulness. It could be great with some changes.
===PROS===
1. It’s free.
2. Simple to set up and use.
3. Auto translates your website.
===CONS===
1. It only uses Google’s standard free translation service which is imperfect. When I translated a paragraph from English to French the result contained four changes in meaning from the original text. Multiply this over 100’s of paragraphs and it becomes a problem.
2. It does not take advantage of the neural machine translation (NMT) services now being offered by Google and Microsoft. This is next gen and is claimed to be near perfect to human translation. Both Google and Microsoft have free accounts for text translation using NMT with an API key, so the plugin would need to allow users to enter an API key.
It is worth mentioning a bit about the NMT offerings by Google and Microsoft. Both have free offerings but require the user to have an account (to get an API key). ATM Google offers a $300 credit with up to 500,000 characters translation per month. The Microsoft offering is better IMO. It is called Auzure Translator and offers 2,000,000 characters translation per month at no cost. That’s between 30,000 and 50,000 words each month!
So, in summary the plugin is OK as far as it goes, but it would be great if users could take full advantage of the Azure Translator NMT free offering by entering their API key.

We use this plugin in several of our clients’ websites, it has a simple interface to make it match the designs.
They also offer good email support which is much appreciated. Thanks!
