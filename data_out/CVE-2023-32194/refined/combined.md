# Permissions on 'namespaces' in any API group grants 'edit' permissions on namespaces in 'core'

High

[andypitcher](/andypitcher)
published
GHSA-c85r-fwc7-45vc
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>=2.6.0, <2.6.14
>=2.7.0, < 2.7.10
>=2.8.0, <2.8.2

## Patched versions

2.6.14
2.7.10
2.8.2

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability has been identified when granting a `create` or `*` **global role** for a resource type of "namespaces"; no matter the API group, the subject will receive `*` permissions for core namespaces. This can lead to someone being capable of accessing, creating, updating, or deleting a namespace in the project. This includes reading or updating a namespace in the project so that it is available in other projects in which the user has the "manage-namespaces" permission or updating another namespace in which the user has normal "update" permissions to be moved into the project.

The expected behavior is to not be able to create, update, or delete a namespace in the project or move another namespace into the project since the user doesn't have any permissions on namespaces in the core API group.

Moving a namespace to another project could lead to leakage of secrets, in case the targeted project has secrets. And also can lead to the namespace being able to abuse the resource quotas of the targeted project.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases `2.6.14`, `2.7.10` and `2.8.2`.

### Workarounds

There is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.

### References

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security-related inquiries.
* Open an issue in the [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.
* Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
