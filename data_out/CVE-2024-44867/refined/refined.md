Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `file_get_contents` function in the `cat` function within `libs/autoload/file.php`. The file path provided to `file_get_contents` is derived from a user-controlled variable, `filename`, without proper sanitization. This allows for arbitrary file read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server due to the lack of input sanitization in the `filename` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** The controllable `filename` parameter allows the attacker to use path traversal sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, source code, or any other files accessible to the web server process.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `admin.php` script with specific parameters `c`, `f`, `id`, and `filename`. The `filename` parameter contains the path to the file the attacker wants to read, including path traversal sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to Website Backend:** The attacker must have permission to access the administrative backend of the phpok3.0 CMS.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable script (`admin.php`), the control parameter (`c=tpl`), the function to trigger (`f=tpl_set`), the required parameter (`id`), and the vulnerable parameter `filename` and its location.
