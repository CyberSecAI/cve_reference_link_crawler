< 3.1.5

## Patched versions

2.1.9
3.1.5

## Description

### Impact

An Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability has been found in the ImageSharp gif decoder, allowing attackers to cause a crash using a specially crafted gif. This can potentially lead to denial of service.

### Patches

The problem has been patched. All users are advised to upgrade to v3.1.5 or v2.1.9.

### Workarounds

None.

### References

[#2754](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/2754)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
