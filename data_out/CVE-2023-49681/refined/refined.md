Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-49681:

**Root Cause:**
- The 'cmbQual' parameter in the `Employer/InsertWalkin.php` resource is vulnerable to SQL Injection because it does not validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `cmbQual` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or data deletion.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** As stated by CVSS vector, successful exploitation allows a complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `Employer/InsertWalkin.php` containing malicious SQL code within the `cmbQual` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, so the attacker does not need to log in.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet from `Employer/InsertWalkin.php` is:
```php
$txtTitle=$_POST['txtTitle'];
$txtTotal=$_POST['txtTotal'];
$cmbQual=$_POST['cmbQual'];
$txtDesc=$_POST['txtDesc'];
$txtDate=$_POST['txtDate'];
$txtTime=$_POST['txtTime'];
$Name=$_SESSION['Name'];
if($cmbQual=="Other")
{
$cmbQual=$_POST['txtOther'];
}
// Establish Connection with MYSQL
$con = mysqli_connect ("localhost","root","","job");

// Specify the query to Insert Record
$sql = "insert into walkin_master (CompanyName,JobTitle,Vacancy,MinQualification,Description,InterviewDate,InterviewTime) values('".$Name."','".$txtTitle."','".$txtTotal."','".$cmbQual."','".$txtDesc."','".$txtDate."','".$txtTime."')";
// execute query
mysqli_query ($con,$sql);
```
The vulnerability lies in the line constructing the SQL query:
```php
$sql = "insert into walkin_master (CompanyName,JobTitle,Vacancy,MinQualification,Description,InterviewDate,InterviewTime) values('".$Name."','".$txtTitle."','".$txtTotal."','".$cmbQual."','".$txtDesc."','".$txtDate."','".$txtTime."')";
```
The `$cmbQual` variable is directly embedded into the SQL query string without any sanitization or use of prepared statements, making it susceptible to SQL injection.
