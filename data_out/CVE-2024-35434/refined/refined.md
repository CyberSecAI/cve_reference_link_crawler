- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `rtp_check_packet` function of `sngrep` when processing a malformed SIP packet. The vulnerability is due to the code accessing memory beyond the allocated bounds when processing an RTCP XR packet without checking if the payload is large enough to contain the expected header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically, the code attempts to read `sizeof(struct rtcp_hdr_xr)` bytes from the payload without first ensuring that the payload is at least that size, leading to a read out-of-bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting adjacent memory regions on the heap.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malformed SIP packet with a crafted RTCP XR header to the `sngrep` application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets that can be captured and processed by the `sngrep` application.
