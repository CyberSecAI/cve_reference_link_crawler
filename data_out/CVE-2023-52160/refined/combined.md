## Bypassing WiFi Authentication

We worked with Professor Vanhoef to identify major security flaws in two instances of commonly-used open-source WiFi software that leave users exposed to traffic interception and other attacks.

The first attack is on users *connecting to* an Enterprise WiFi network, the second is an attack on an *existing* home network.

Our goal with publishing this research is to raise the standard of wireless network security by identifying serious software vulnerabilities so that vendors patch them and then make sure the public is informed.

We also want to raise public awareness about the [risks inherent in using shared networks](/guides/public-wifi-security-tips/) and share advice on how to protect against them.

### What devices are affected?

The vulnerability affecting `wpa_supplicant` v2.10 and lower (CVE-2023-52160) is particularly concerning as this is the default software used in Android devices to handle login requests to wireless networks.

> There are 2.3 billion Android users worldwide who could therefore be affected by this vulnerability.[[1]](#footnote-1)

The `wpa_supplicant` software is also found in almost all Linux devices, as well as in ChromeOS, the operating system used in Chromebooks, which are very popular in educational settings.

While the `wpa_supplicant` vulnerability only affects WiFi clients that aren’t properly configured to verify the certificate of the authentication server, recent studies show that this is unfortunately often the case, especially with the affected devices.[[2]](#footnote-2)

The vulnerability in IWD v2.13 and lower (CVE-2023-52161) impacts fewer people as it’s Linux-only WiFi software. However it affects *everyone* using IWD as an access point, as the vulnerability does not rely on any misconfiguration.

Developed by Intel, IWD is intended as a comprehensive connectivity solution for Linux and an eventual replacement for `wpa_supplicant`.[[3]](#footnote-3) It is available in the official package managers of all major Linux distributions.

### What types of WiFi networks are at risk?

The vulnerability in `wpa_supplicant` affects WiFi networks using [Enterprise mode of WPA2/3](https://www.securew2.com/solutions/wpa2-enterprise-and-802-1x-simplified#documentation-link-0-2) rather than the less secure, personal mode more typical of home WiFi networks.

Ironically, the security flaw identified in this report relates to the potential for abuse of the mutual authentication process present only in Enterprise mode, which is generally recommended for use by larger businesses.

The IWD vulnerability, on the other hand, affects home WiFi networks.

### How can these new vulnerabilities be exploited?

The `wpa_supplicant` vulnerability allows a bad actor to trick their victim into automatically connecting to a malicious clone of a trusted WiFi network in order to intercept their traffic.

As the attack requires no action by the victim, it’s likely the victim would be unaware they had been targeted.

All the attacker needs to exploit this vulnerability is the SSID of an Enterprise WPA2/3 network to which the victim has previously connected and also to be in range of the victim.

One possible such scenario might be where an attacker walks around a company’s building scanning for networks before targeting an employee leaving the office.

The IWD vulnerability is different in that it allows an adversary to gain full access to an existing protected WiFi network, exposing existing users and devices to attack.

The risks of such an attack, particularly to a small business using this kind of WiFi network, are significant and include:

* Interception of sensitive data
* Malware infections
* Ransomware attacks
* Business email compromise
* Password theft

### How to defend against these attacks

Both vulnerabilities were reported to vendors, have been patched and are available as part of their public code repositories.

The usual advice about updating software and operating systems applies with IWD, as it releases frequent updates.

However, the OS you are using will determine how straightforward it is to make sure your devices are secured against the `wpa_supplicant` vulnerability.

**ChromeOS** users can simply update to the latest version as it has been patched since at least version 118.

**Linux** users however are reliant on their distribution providing a patched version of `wpa_supplicant`. This is not typically done by default, so maintainers will have to ensure [the patch](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=8e6485a1bcb0baff) is backported into the provided `wpa_supplicant` version.

**Android** users unfortunately must wait on a new Android security update that includes the `wpa_supplicant` patch. This can unfortunately take a long time, from several months up to even years.

In the meantime, it’s critical therefore that Android users manually configure the CA certificate of any saved Enterprise networks to prevent the attack.

University students and staff connecting to eduroam can also can use the [CAT tool](https://eduroam.org/configuration-assistant-tool-cat/) to securely configure Android. On the latest Android devices, it’s also possible to use [Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU)](https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/wifi-tofu) to automatically trust the CA certificate when connecting to the network for the first time.

A sensible precaution would also be to clean up any unused WPA2/3 enterprise networks and to toggle off automatic reconnection for any regularly used networks of that type.

As an additional defense, we recommend habitually using a [VPN for public WiFi networks](/guides/public-wifi-vpn/) as this will at least prevent an attacker from intercepting your internet traffic, as it will be encrypted.

Take a look at our recommendations for the [most reliable VPNs for Android](/best-vpn/android/) and [Linux](/best-vpn/linux/). Our Android VPN recommendations also apply for ChromeOS users.

While a VPN will protect your internet traffic from bad actors, it can’t defend against every kind of attack arising from these or any future vulnerabilities.

In the following sections we go into more detail about the two vulnerabilities.

For a full technical analysis and all relevant background, download the [Bypassing WiFi Authentication in Modern WPA2/3 Networks report](/assets/2024/01/Top10VPN-Vanhoef-WiFi-Vulnerabilities.pdf) authored by Mathy Vanhoef and Héloïse Gollier.

## Attack Video Demonstration

Prof. Vanhoef demonstrates the WiFi authentication vulnerabilities in wpa\_supplicant and IWD.

## Vulnerability in wpa\_supplicant

Prof. Vanhoef, together with Ms Gollier, discovered a flaw in the implementation of [PEAP](https://www.okta.com/uk/identity-101/peap/), which allows an attacker to skip the second phase of authentication when the target device has not been properly configured to verify the authentication server.

Note that PEAP is the most common authentication method for Enterprise networks.

The vulnerable code in the flawed implementation of PEAP in `wpa_supplicant` is shown below.

![Vulnerable PEAPv1 code in wpa_supplicant](/assets/2024/01/wpa_supplicant-vuln-code-in-PEAPv1.png)

Vulnerable PEAPv1 code in wpa\_supplicant.

By skipping Phase-2 authentication, it’s much easier for an attacker to create a rogue clone of a trusted WiFi network and trick the victim into connecting, all without knowing their password.

### Typical Attack Prerequisites

1. The attacker needs to know the SSID of the target Enterprise WPA2/3 network
2. The attacker must be within range of their victim, who can be located anywhere, i.e. they don’t need to be in range of the network being impersonated during the attack
3. `wpa_supplicant` must be configured to **not** verify the authentication server’s TLS certificate

These are not particularly onerous prerequisites for an attack.

It is trivial to harvest SSIDs from around office buildings or to advertise popular Enterprise network names such as `eduroam`, `Vodafone Homespot`, `TelenetWiFree` or `Unitymedia WifiSpot` for example, and simply wait for an unsuspecting victim to connect.

The misconfiguration of `wpa_supplicant` is unfortunately a known issue on many systems.

Proper configuration is a manual process, whose confusing and tedious nature prompts many users to skip it.

The resulting attack can be seen in the diagram below, where the Phase-2 authentication can be skipped by sending the EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase-2.

Once connected, the adversary can intercept and manipulate all internet traffic of the victim.

![Details of exploit of wpa_supplicant vulnerability](/assets/2024/01/wpa_supplicant-attack_details.png)

Details of exploit of wpa\_supplicant vulnerability.

## Vulnerability in IWD

The vulnerability in IWD stems from its implementation of the 4-way handshake, which is used when connecting to any protected WiFi network for the first time.

It is exploitable when IWD is operating in Access Point (AP) mode.

Vulnerable versions of IWD fail to verify in which order message 2 or 4 of the handshake are received, i.e. it fails to store or check what the expected next message should be in the handshake. Instead, IWD simply accepts *any* message.

In the code snippet below you can see that the vulnerability is in the function `eapol_auth_key_handle`, which is called whenever a 4-way handshake messages is received by the AP.

![Vulnerable code in IWD](/assets/2024/01/iwd-vulnerable_code.png)

Vulnerable code in IWD.

In line 9 it checks whether the AP has already sent message 1 of the 4-way handshake, i.e. to verify that a handshake is in progress.

However, in lines 12-16 there is no check for whether the AP now expects message 2 or 4. Instead, whatever message arrives next is processed.

This means that when an attacker is connecting to an IWD network, they can skip message 2 and immediately send message 4 in order to gain full access to the network.

In the event of such an attack, IWD will still try to verify the MIC (Message Integrity Code) of the received message 4.

However, it falls back to using an all-zero PTK (Pairwise Transient Key), which is the default in the absence of a valid PTK derived on receipt of message 2, as that step has been skipped in this exploit.

So therefore all an attacker has to do is send a message 4 where the MIC is calculated using an all-zero PTK in order for it to be verified by IWD and the handshake completed.

From this point on, IWD will accept encrypted data frames from the attacker, which are also encrypted using the all-zero PTK, giving them full access to the WiFi network.

Below is an example of a successful attack where messages 2 and 3 are skipped, followed by the exchange of encrypted data frames.

<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                           Chris Lamb

Package        : wpa
Version        : 2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-52160
Debian Bug     : 1064061

It was discovered that there was a potential authentication bypass
vulnerability in wpa, a set of tools including the widely-used
wpasupplicant client for authenticating with WPA and WPA2 wireless
networks.

For an attack to have been successful, wpasupplicant must have been
configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1
of the authentication cycle; a eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability could
have been used to skip Phase 2 authentication by sending an EAP-TLV
"Success" packet instead of starting Phase 2.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2:2.7+git20190128+0c1e29f-6+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

For the detailed security status of wpa please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

PEAP client: Update Phase 2 authentication requirementsThe previous PEAP client behavior allowed the server to skip Phase 2
authentication with the expectation that the server was authenticated
during Phase 1 through TLS server certificate validation. Various PEAP
specifications are not exactly clear on what the behavior on this front
is supposed to be and as such, this ended up being more flexible than
the TTLS/FAST/TEAP cases. However, this is not really ideal when
unfortunately common misconfiguration of PEAP is used in deployed
devices where the server trust root (ca\_cert) is not configured or the
user has an easy option for allowing this validation step to be skipped.
Change the default PEAP client behavior to be to require Phase 2
authentication to be successfully completed for cases where TLS session
resumption is not used and the client certificate has not been
configured. Those two exceptions are the main cases where a deployed
authentication server might skip Phase 2 and as such, where a more
strict default behavior could result in undesired interoperability
issues. Requiring Phase 2 authentication will end up disabling TLS
session resumption automatically to avoid interoperability issues.
Allow Phase 2 authentication behavior to be configured with a new phase1
configuration parameter option:
'phase2\_auth' option can be used to control Phase 2 (i.e., within TLS
tunnel) behavior for PEAP:
\* 0 = do not require Phase 2 authentication
\* 1 = require Phase 2 authentication when client certificate
(private\_key/client\_cert) is no used and TLS session resumption was
not used (default)
\* 2 = require Phase 2 authentication in all cases
