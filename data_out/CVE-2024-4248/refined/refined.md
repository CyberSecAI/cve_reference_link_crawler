Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formQosManage_auto` function within the Tenda i21 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `index` variable, derived from the user-controlled `ssidIndex` parameter in a POST request, is used in `sprintf(mib_prefix_wl2g, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);`.
- The `sprintf` function does not perform bounds checking, allowing a user-supplied `ssidIndex` value exceeding the `mib_prefix_wl2g` array's capacity to cause a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the stack-based overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to the device's web interface.
- The `ssidIndex` parameter in the POST request is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`ssidIndex`) and the target endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the Tenda i21 firmware version V1.0.0.14(4656).
- A proof-of-concept (POC) is provided showing how to trigger the overflow.
- The `mib_prefix_wl2g` is the vulnerable buffer being overwritten.
