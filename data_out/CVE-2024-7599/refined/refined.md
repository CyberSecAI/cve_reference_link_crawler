Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7599

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `sermon_video_embed` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `sermon_video_embed` parameter, before storing it in the database. It also doesn't properly escape this stored data before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into the affected pages. These scripts can perform various malicious actions, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    - Displaying unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker injects a malicious script in the `sermon_video_embed` field within the WordPress admin panel while creating or editing a sermon. This injected code is stored in the database. When a user views the sermon page, the stored, malicious script executes within the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create/edit sermons and add data to the vulnerable `sermon_video_embed` field.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Advanced Sermons plugin up to and including version 3.3.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.4 by implementing proper sanitization using `wp_kses` with a defined set of allowed HTML tags for the `sermon_video_embed` field.
- The plugin's code was modified to use `wp_kses` to sanitize the `sermon_video_embed` input before saving it, and to sanitize again before outputting. This is a critical security measure against XSS attacks.
- The vulnerable code was located in `advanced-sermons/trunk/admin/meta/sermon-details.php` (where the data is saved) and `advanced-sermons/trunk/include/templates/sections/video-template.php` (where the unsanitized data was output).
