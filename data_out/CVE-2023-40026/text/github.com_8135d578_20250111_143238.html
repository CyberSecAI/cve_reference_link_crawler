# Path traversal allows leaking out-of-bound Helm charts from Argo CD repo-server

Moderate

published
GHSA-6jqw-jwf5-rp8h
Sep 27, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<2.3

## Patched versions

2.3

## Description

### Impact

In Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in v0.1.0, but likely in any version using Helm before 2.3), using a specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external Helm charts handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the referenced Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were predictable.

The vulnerability worked by adding a Helm chart that referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because the paths of Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-server, it was possible to reference and then render the values and resources from other existing Helm charts regardless of permissions. While generally, secrets are not stored in these files, it was nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing Helm paths.

### Workarounds

User's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to update to a [supported version](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions). If this is not possible, disabling Helm chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server for each Helm chart would prevent possible exploitation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
