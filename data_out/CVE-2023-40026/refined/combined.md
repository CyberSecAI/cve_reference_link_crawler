# Path traversal allows leaking out-of-bound Helm charts from Argo CD repo-server

Moderate

[crenshaw-dev](/crenshaw-dev)
published
GHSA-6jqw-jwf5-rp8h
Sep 27, 2023

## Package

gomod

github.com/argoproj/argo-cd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<2.3

## Patched versions

2.3

## Description

### Impact

In Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in v0.1.0, but likely in any version using Helm before 2.3), using a specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external Helm charts handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the referenced Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were predictable.

The vulnerability worked by adding a Helm chart that referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because the paths of Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-server, it was possible to reference and then render the values and resources from other existing Helm charts regardless of permissions. While generally, secrets are not stored in these files, it was nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing Helm paths.

### Workarounds

User's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to update to a [supported version](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#supported-versions). If this is not possible, disabling Helm chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server for each Helm chart would prevent possible exploitation.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Installation[¶](#installation "Permanent link")

Argo CD has two type of installations: multi-tenant and core.

## Multi-Tenant[¶](#multi-tenant "Permanent link")

The multi-tenant installation is the most common way to install Argo CD. This type of installation is typically used to service multiple application developer teams
in the organization and maintained by a platform team.

The end-users can access Argo CD via the API server using the Web UI or `argocd` CLI. The `argocd` CLI has to be configured using `argocd login <server-host>` command
(learn more [here](../../user-guide/commands/argocd_login/)).

Two types of installation manifests are provided:

### Non High Availability:[¶](#non-high-availability "Permanent link")

Not recommended for production use. This type of installation is typically used during evaluation period for demonstrations and testing.

* [install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/install.yaml) - Standard Argo CD installation with cluster-admin access. Use this
  manifest set if you plan to use Argo CD to deploy applications in the same cluster that Argo CD runs
  in (i.e. kubernetes.svc.default). It will still be able to deploy to external clusters with inputted
  credentials.

> Note: The ClusterRoleBinding in the installation manifest is bound to a ServiceAccount in the argocd namespace.
> Be cautious when modifying the namespace, as changing it may cause permission-related errors unless the ClusterRoleBinding is correctly adjusted to reflect the new namespace.

* [namespace-install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/namespace-install.yaml) - Installation of Argo CD which requires only
  namespace level privileges (does not need cluster roles). Use this manifest set if you do not
  need Argo CD to deploy applications in the same cluster that Argo CD runs in, and will rely solely
  on inputted cluster credentials. An example of using this set of manifests is if you run several
  Argo CD instances for different teams, where each instance will be deploying applications to
  external clusters. It will still be possible to deploy to the same cluster (kubernetes.svc.default)
  with inputted credentials (i.e. `argocd cluster add <CONTEXT> --in-cluster --namespace <YOUR NAMESPACE>`).

> Note: Argo CD CRDs are not included into [namespace-install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/namespace-install.yaml).
> and have to be installed separately. The CRD manifests are located in the [manifests/crds](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/crds) directory.
> Use the following command to install them:
> ```
> kubectl apply -k https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/manifests/crds\?ref\=stable
>
> ```

### High Availability:[¶](#high-availability "Permanent link")

High Availability installation is recommended for production use. This bundle includes the same components but tuned for high availability and resiliency.

* [ha/install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/ha/install.yaml) - the same as install.yaml but with multiple replicas for
  supported components.
* [ha/namespace-install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/ha/namespace-install.yaml) - the same as namespace-install.yaml but
  with multiple replicas for supported components.

## Core[¶](#core "Permanent link")

The Argo CD Core installation is primarily used to deploy Argo CD in
headless mode. This type of installation is most suitable for cluster
administrators who independently use Argo CD and don't need
multi-tenancy features. This installation includes fewer components
and is easier to setup. The bundle does not include the API server or
UI, and installs the lightweight (non-HA) version of each component.

Installation manifest is available at [core-install.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/core-install.yaml).

For more details about Argo CD Core please refer to the [official
documentation](../core/)

## Kustomize[¶](#kustomize "Permanent link")

The Argo CD manifests can also be installed using Kustomize. It is recommended to include the manifest as a remote resource and apply additional customizations
using Kustomize patches.

```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: argocd
resources:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.2/manifests/install.yaml

```

For an example of this, see the [kustomization.yaml](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj-deployments/blob/master/argocd/kustomization.yaml)
used to deploy the [Argoproj CI/CD infrastructure](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj-deployments#argoproj-deployments).

#### Installing Argo CD in a Custom Namespace[¶](#installing-argo-cd-in-a-custom-namespace "Permanent link")

If you want to install Argo CD in a namespace other than the default argocd, you can use Kustomize to apply a patch that updates the ClusterRoleBinding to reference the correct namespace for the ServiceAccount. This ensures that the necessary permissions are correctly set in your custom namespace.

Below is an example of how to configure your kustomization.yaml to install Argo CD in a custom namespace:
```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: <your-custom-namespace>
resources:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.2/manifests/install.yaml

patches:
  - patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /subjects/0/namespace
        value: <your-custom-namespace>
    target:
      kind: ClusterRoleBinding

```

This patch ensures that the ClusterRoleBinding correctly maps to the ServiceAccount in your custom namespace, preventing any permission-related issues during the deployment.

## Helm[¶](#helm "Permanent link")

The Argo CD can be installed using [Helm](https://helm.sh/). The Helm chart is currently community maintained and available at
[argo-helm/charts/argo-cd](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-cd).

## Supported versions[¶](#supported-versions "Permanent link")

For detailed information regarding Argo CD's version support policy, please refer to the [Release Process and Cadence documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/release-process-and-cadence/).

## Tested versions[¶](#tested-versions "Permanent link")
