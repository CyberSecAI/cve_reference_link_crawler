- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to cryptographic algorithms and cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cryptographic vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerabilities could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't specify the attack vectors, but they would likely involve exploiting the cryptographic weaknesses or injecting malicious scripts via XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not specify the required capabilities or position of the attacker, but it would likely require the ability to interact with the application.
