Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-20074:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check in the `dmc` component.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write:** The missing bounds check allows for an out-of-bounds write operation.

**Impact:**
- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a local privilege escalation. This means an attacker who already has limited access (e.g., a normal user or a compromised app) could gain elevated (System) privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have already obtained "System" privileges on the affected device. This could be achieved through another exploit or by compromising a system application.
- User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

**Affected Components:**
- `dmc` component
