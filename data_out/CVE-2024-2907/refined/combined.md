## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# AGCA – Custom Dashboard & Login Page < 7.2.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Image URL

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate AGCA, and select the "Admin Bar" tab.
2. Enter XSS payload in the "Admin bar logo link" field: javascript:alert(document.cookie);
3. Click on "Save Changes", and then click on the WP logo.
4. You will notice a popup with the current session cookie.
