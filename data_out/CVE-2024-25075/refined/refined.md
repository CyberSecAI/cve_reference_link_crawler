- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Mishandling of publish responses when an OPC UA subscription is created with a very low MaxNotificationPerPublish parameter, leading to memory consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing release of memory after effective lifetime (CWE-401).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Repeated triggering of the vulnerability leads to memory exhaustion, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via OPC UA subscription creation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create OPC UA subscriptions with specific parameters (very low MaxNotificationPerPublish). It appears that the attacker requires network access (AV:N) and must have valid credentials to create an OPC UA subscription (PR:L).
