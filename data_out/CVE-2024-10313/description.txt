iniNet Solutions SpiderControl SCADA PC HMI Editor has a path traversal 
vulnerability. When the software loads a malicious â€˜ems' project 
template file constructed by an attacker, it can write files to 
arbitrary directories. This can lead to overwriting system files, 
causing system paralysis, or writing to startup items, resulting in 
remote control.
