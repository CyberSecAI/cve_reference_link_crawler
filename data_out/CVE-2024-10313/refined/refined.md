Root cause of vulnerability:
The iniNet Solutions SpiderControl SCADA PC HMI Editor is vulnerable to a path traversal issue when loading a malicious 'ems' project template file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') CWE-22

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary directories. This can lead to overwriting system files, causing system paralysis, or writing to startup items, resulting in remote control of the device.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by loading a malicious 'ems' project template file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious 'ems' project template file to be loaded by the vulnerable software. Low attack complexity, low privileges required (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R) is required as the user must load the malicious file. The attack can be done remotely (AV:N).
