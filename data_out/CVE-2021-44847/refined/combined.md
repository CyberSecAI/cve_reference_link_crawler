### @sudden6 **[sudden6](/sudden6)** commented [Dec 5, 2021](#issue-1071448700) • edited by iphydf Loading

This PR fixes a stack based buffer overflow in the DHT packet handler which is . I don't know if it's exploitable because I patched away the crypto layer, but I'd choose to error safe side here and assume yes until proven otherwise.

I'll open a PR to discuss how to prevent issues with computed values in macros in the future.
