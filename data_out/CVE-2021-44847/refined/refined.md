{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect calculation of buffer size in the `CRYPTO_SIZE` macro. Due to missing parentheses, operator precedence rules caused only '1' to be subtracted instead of the intended `CRYPTO_SIZE`. This resulted in a smaller-than-required buffer being allocated on the stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Incorrect macro usage due to missing braces, leading to wrong operator precedence"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack-based buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is present in the DHT packet handler, specifically in the `cryptopacket_handle` function which calls `decrypt_data`, potentially triggered by a specially crafted network packet.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a vulnerable `c-toxcore` instance and cause the `cryptopacket_handle` function to be executed with a malicious payload."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves adding parentheses around `CRYPTO_SIZE` within the macro to enforce the correct order of operations, preventing the incorrect subtraction, which ensures the buffer is sized appropriately to avoid overflow."
  ]
