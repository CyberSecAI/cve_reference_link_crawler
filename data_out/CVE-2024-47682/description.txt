In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sd: Fix off-by-one error in sd_read_block_characteristics()

Ff the device returns page 0xb1 with length 8 (happens with qemu v2.x, for
example), sd_read_block_characteristics() may attempt an out-of-bounds
memory access when accessing the zoned field at offset 8.
