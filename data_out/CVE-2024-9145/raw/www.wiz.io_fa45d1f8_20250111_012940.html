that could affect Wiz products. </p><p class=""><br/><strong>Date: </strong>September 11, 2024</p><p class=""><strong>Title:</strong> Security Update for Wiz Visual Studio Code Extension<br/><br/><strong>Summary:<br/></strong><br/>On September 11, 2024, Wiz was notified by a security researcher of a vulnerability affecting the Wiz Visual Studio Code Extension.<br/><br/>Upon review, Wiz confirmed that the vulnerability could permit local command injection on a developer workstation when certain preconditions were met: an affected user of the extension would have to open a maliciously crafted Docker image file, do so from a file path that has been marked as a “trusted folder” within Visual Studio Code, and initiate a manual scan of the file. <br/><br/>This issue only affects users of the Wiz VS Code Extension that interact with a maliciously crafted file as described above. <br/><br/><strong>The Wiz cloud platform and products are not affected</strong>. Wiz would like to thank Rohit Kumar (@rohitcoder) for identifying and notifying us of this vulnerability. Wiz supports responsible disclosure by the security researcher community, and maintains a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/security-disclosures">security disclosures</a> page with details on how to submit findings and eligibility criteria.<br/><br/><strong>Affected Versions of the Wiz Code Extension:</strong><br/>Wiz has two generations of the Wiz extension on the VS Code marketplace.<br/> The impacted versions are:<br/><br/>Wiz (legacy): Versions 0.13.0 - 0.17.8 are vulnerable; fix is in version 0.17.9 and greater.<br/>Wiz Code: Versions 1.0.0 - 1.5.3 are vulnerable; fix is in version 1.5.4 and greater.<br/><br/><strong>Actions Recommended:</strong><br/>Users that have installed the Wiz Code Extension should update it to the fixed versions specified above. As a workaround prior to upgrading, users can also disable the “pull” feature in the extension via: <code>wiz.pullDockerfileImages </code> to avoid pulling images before scanning a dockerfile base image.<br/><br/>Note that for compatibility reasons, the Wiz Code VS Code Extension 1.5.4 requires upgrading Wiz CLI to version 0.46.0. <br/><br/>Wiz customers that need additional assistance can open a support ticket - our teams are ready to help as needed!<br/><br/><strong>Timeline (all times in UTC):</strong><br/>2024-09-11 13:44 - Researcher contacts Wiz security team to share details on the vulnerability<br/>2024-09-11 14:08 - Wiz Engineering validates the issue and starts working on a fix<br/>2024-09-11 14:18  -  Wiz Security Team e-mails researcher to acknowledge receipt<br/>2024-09-11 17:11    -  Wiz Engineering publishes fixed version of extensions to VS Code Marketplace</p><p class=""></p></div><div aria-hidden="true" class="h-20 md:h-24 lg:h-32"></div></div><footer
