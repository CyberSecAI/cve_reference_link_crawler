Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-0075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver not validating the parameters passed to it, leading to a NULL-pointer dereference when a user attempts to access those parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation. Specifically, the driver fails to check the validity of passed parameters.
- NULL-pointer dereference. The lack of validation leads to the driver attempting to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The NULL-pointer dereference can crash the driver, leading to a denial of service.
- Limited Information Disclosure. The vulnerability might allow limited information disclosure, although this is a secondary impact according to the description.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L). The attacker needs local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires a low privileged user (PR:L)
- No user interaction is needed (UI:N).

**Affected Products:**
- NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux

**Affected Versions:**
-  Windows: All versions prior to 551.61 (R550 branch), 538.33 (R535 branch), and 474.82 (R470 branch).
