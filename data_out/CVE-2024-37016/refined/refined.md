  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Mengshen Wireless Door Alarm lacks proper security mechanisms such as message signatures or rolling keys.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can disarm the alarm system by replaying captured signals, leading to unauthorized access to secured facilities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack involves sniffing the sub-gigahertz signals used for arming and disarming the system and replaying them.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs a sub-gigahertz antenna and a software-defined radio or specialized hardware like a Flipper Zero to capture and replay the signals. The attacker needs to be within range of the device to capture the signal."
