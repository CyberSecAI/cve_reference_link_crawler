```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the composio\\server\\api.py file where there is no restriction placed on the path() function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file read vulnerability due to lack of path sanitization in the path() function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files such as /root/.ssh/id_rsa, potentially allowing keyless login to the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the path() function within the composio\\server\\api.py file, an attacker can provide a path to read any file on the system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Composio Server and provide a file path to be read. If the Composio Server is running with root permissions, then the attacker could potentially access sensitive files that would otherwise be protected."
