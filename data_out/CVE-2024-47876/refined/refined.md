The provided content relates to CVE-2024-47876.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that users created with the type `roleview` were able to log in as normal users, which should not be allowed. This occurred because the `authenticate` method in `BaseUserDirectoryService` did not properly prevent authentication for users with the `roleview` type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect User Type Handling:** The system failed to differentiate and handle users with the `roleview` type correctly during authentication, allowing them to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The `authenticate` method in `BaseUserDirectoryService` was not properly checking the user type, leading to successful login attempts for users meant for role view simulation purposes only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Exploitation allows a user created for role-view simulation to gain unauthorized access to the system as a regular user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with limited role view access can escalate their privileges to those of a regular user.
- **Illegal System Access:**  The vulnerability can grant unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves attempting to log in with the credentials of a user that was created with type `roleview`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to know the credentials (loginId/password) of a user account created with the `roleview` type.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The issue was addressed in commit `a9aadd9347cfb204515e89ac0163e1be9e56cc41`.
- The fix includes changes in:
    - `UserDirectoryService.java`: Added a method `isRoleViewType` to check if a user ID represents a role view user.
    - `BaseSiteService.java`: Updated the `addMockUserInSite` method to not include email for roleview users.
    - `BaseUserDirectoryService.java`: Implemented the `isRoleViewType` method and modified the `authenticate` method to prevent authentication for `roleview` users.
    - `RoleSwitchHandler.java`:  Modified the redirection URLs.
- The vulnerability affects versions 23.0, 23.1, and 23.2 of the Sakai project, and is fixed in version 23.3.
