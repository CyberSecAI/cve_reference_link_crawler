**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin uses `add_query_arg` without proper escaping on a URL, which allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page. If a user clicks a malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser. This could lead to the attacker stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or other malicious actions performed within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious link and convince a user to click it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.3.14 of the "Magazine Blocks â€“ Blog Designer, Magazine & Newspaper Website Builder, Page Builder with Posts Blocks, Post Grid" plugin for WordPress.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `mzb_numbered_pagination` function within the `includes/Blocks.php` file.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.15 by using `esc_url` when constructing the pagination links.
