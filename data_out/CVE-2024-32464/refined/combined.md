[[CVE-2024-32464](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prjp-h48f-jgf6 "CVE-2024-32464")]
Instances of ActionText::Attachable::ContentAttachment included
within a rich_text_area tag could potentially contain unsanitized
HTML. This could lead to a potential cross site scripting issue
within the Trix editor.

This change enforces existing sanitization routines on
ActionText::Attachable::ContentAttachment attachments.
