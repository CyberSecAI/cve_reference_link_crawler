- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Leftover debug code in the `httpd` service's `check_credentials` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `check_credentials` function contains a hardcoded debug username/password combination ("ffadmin"/"ffadminff") that bypasses the normal authentication mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain admin access to the router's management interface.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a specific "Authorization" header containing the base64 encoded debug credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. No prior authentication is required.
