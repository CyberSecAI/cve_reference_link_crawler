Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2978

    "butt3rflyh4ck", Hao Sun, and Jiacheng Xu reported a flaw in the
    nilfs2 filesystem driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local use might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3521

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem
    which could lead to a crash.

    This subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3524

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which
    could lead to a memory leak.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3564

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3565

    A flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a
    use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3594

    Andrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log
    excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors.  A
    remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3621, CVE-2022-3646

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak.  A user
    permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to
    cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3628

    Dokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential
    heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver.  A user
    able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3640

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3643 (XSA-423)

    A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would
    result in it generating malformed packet buffers.  If these
    packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen
    guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    device reset).

CVE-2022-3649

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20369

    A flaw was found in the v4l2-mem2mem media driver that would lead
    to an out-of-bounds write.  A local user with access to such a
    device could exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

CVE-2022-40768

    "hdthky" reported that the stex SCSI adapter driver did not fully
    initialise a structure that is copied to user-space.  A local user
    with access to such a device could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    Tam√°s Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    Tam√°s Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.269-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
