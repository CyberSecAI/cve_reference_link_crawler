### @ColtonWilley **[ColtonWilley](/ColtonWilley)** commented [May 30, 2024](#issue-2326635726) • edited by SparkiDev Loading

# Description

Rewrite pattern matching to always use explicit lengths instead of expecting NULL terminated strings, thus replicating the behavior of openssl X509\_check\_host(). This rewrite fixes a buffer overread of size 1 to read the NULL terminator, in addition to fixing the issue of some strings matching or not matching incorrectly.

Fixes ZD 17987 which was only partially fixed by PR#7534.

# Checklist

* added tests

Sorry, something went wrong.
