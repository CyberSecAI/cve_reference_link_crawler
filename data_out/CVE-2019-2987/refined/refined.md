Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the provided documents, focusing on CVE-2019-2987:

**1. CVE-2019-2987:**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing glyph bitmap image dimension check in `FreetypeFontScaler` within OpenJDK.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Improper handling of image dimensions, leading to a potential bypass of security checks during font processing.
*   **Impact:**  A successful exploit could cause a denial-of-service condition, likely application crash, due to the missing validation of the bitmap dimensions. The issue resides in the 2D graphics part of OpenJDK.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted font file to the vulnerable system, most likely via a program that uses the vulnerable version of OpenJDK to render fonts.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the capability to deliver the malicious font file to the system. This could be via a website, a document, or any other pathway where the system would process the file as a font.

**2. Other Vulnerabilities Mentioned (grouped by type):**

These vulnerabilities appear in the advisories alongside CVE-2019-2987 and often share similar affected components (like 2D graphics, networking, etc.):

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **CVE-2019-2962:** A NULL pointer dereference in `DrawGlyphList`, also in 2D graphics.
    *   **CVE-2019-2964:**  Unexpected exception during regular expression processing in `Pattern`, which could be triggered to cause a DoS.
    *   **CVE-2019-2973, CVE-2019-2981:** Unexpected exceptions when processing crafted XPath expressions using `XPathParser` which leads to DoS.
    *   **CVE-2019-2992:** Excessive memory allocation in CMap when reading TrueType fonts can lead to a DoS by exhausting system resources.
    *   **CVE-2019-2988:** Integer overflow in bounds check in `SunGraphics2D`, which can lead to DoS.
*   **Networking Issues:**
    *   **CVE-2019-2978:** Incorrect handling of nested `jar:` URLs in the `Jar URL` handler.
    *   **CVE-2019-2989:** Incorrect handling of HTTP proxy responses in `HttpURLConnection`.
    *    **CVE-2019-2945:** Missing restrictions on the use of custom `SocketImpl`.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:**
    *   **CVE-2019-2983:** Unexpected exception thrown during `Font` object deserialization, leading to potential DoS.
*   **Scripting/Processing:**
    *   **CVE-2019-2975:** Unexpected exceptions during regular expression processing in Nashorn.
*   **Kerberos:**
    *   **CVE-2019-2949:** Improper handling of Kerberos proxy credentials.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **CVE-2019-2999:** Insufficient filtering of HTML event attributes in Javadoc, potentially leading to an XSS vector.

**3. Summary of Impact (general):**

These CVEs can lead to a variety of impacts, including:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crashing applications or exhausting resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Through unexpected exceptions or improper handling of data.
*   **Unauthorised Access/Impersonation:** Bypassing sandbox restrictions and Kerberos user impersonation.
*   **XSS attacks:** injecting malicious scripts via javadoc.

**4. Affected Products:**

The documents list several affected products, including:

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (various versions and architectures)
*   OpenJDK (various versions)
*   NetApp Products (various products that integrate with Java Platform)
*   Oracle Java SE, Oracle Java SE Embedded
*   openSUSE Leap (various versions)
*   Ubuntu (various versions and components)
*   Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and various other Oracle Products

**5. Attack Vectors and Attacker Capabilities:**

Attack vectors include:

*   **Network:** Many of the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Local:** Some attacks require local access to the system.
*  **Specially Crafted input:** Providing specially crafted inputs, such as fonts, URLs, and regular expressions can trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **Malicious code delivery:** Attackers might try to inject code via a malicious web page or a crafted file (like a font file or a jar file).

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisories often mention that "All running instances of OpenJDK Java must be restarted for the update to take effect," which indicates the updates target running instances to make the changes take place and address vulnerabilities.
*   Some advisories also note the affected components and how they are used. For example, CVE-2019-2987 occurs in the 2D part of OpenJDK, and specific types of network traffic or protocol interactions may be related to a networking vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2019-2987 highlights a flaw in font processing, which is just one of many vulnerabilities found within the OpenJDK that could lead to DoS, or worse, unauthorized access. Patches were made available across numerous platforms and products.
