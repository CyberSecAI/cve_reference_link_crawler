Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9700

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing validation on the `entry_id` user-controlled key within the `submit_quizzes()` function of the Forminator plugin. This lack of validation allows attackers to potentially manipulate quiz submissions by modifying the `entry_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the `entry_id` provided by the user to access and potentially modify quiz submission data without proper authorization checks. This allows attackers to reference and potentially manipulate other users' submissions by simply changing the `entry_id` value in the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Modification:** An unauthenticated attacker can modify other users' quiz submissions. This could include changing answers, scores, or other submitted data.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authorization checks and access/modify data they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `entry_id` parameter within an HTTP request when submitting a quiz. By crafting a specific request with a different users' `entry_id`, the attacker can then modify the associated submission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Forminator plugin versions up to and including 1.36.0.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.36.1 by adding a validation of the `entry_id`.
*   The vulnerability affects the `submit_quizzes()` function specifically.
*   The fix includes checking if an entry ID is provided, verifying if the quiz has lead capture enabled, and ensuring that the provided entry ID belongs to the current quiz and has not already been submitted.

The provided information offers a good view of the vulnerability and its root cause. The information from Wordfence provides a clear description of the IDOR vulnerability.
