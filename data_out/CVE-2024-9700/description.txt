The Forminator Forms â€“ Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.36.0 via the submit_quizzes() function due to missing validation on the 'entry_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify other user's quiz submissions.
