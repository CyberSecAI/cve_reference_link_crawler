{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application relies on the `AuthCookie` field in the cookie to determine if a user is logged in. However, this value is fixed for each user and the same cookie value is used for every login. Additionally, the `Auth_Key`, a variable used in generating the `AuthCookie`, has a default value written in the configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect Authorization",
    "Session persistence vulnerability",
    "Predictable AuthCookie generation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, knowing the default `Auth_Key`, can generate valid `AuthCookie` values to impersonate any user and log in without proper credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "By obtaining the default Auth_Key and crafting the `AuthCookie` based on it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the default `Auth_Key` value, which is found in the configuration file. No other specific capabilities or positions are mentioned."
