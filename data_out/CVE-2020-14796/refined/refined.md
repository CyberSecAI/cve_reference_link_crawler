**Root Cause:**
The root cause of CVE-2020-14796 is within the Java SE Libraries, specifically in how they handle certain operations. The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of specific data or requests by these libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is present within the Java SE Libraries, indicating that the weakness is likely present in the code for handling specific data types, requests or configurations.  The vulnerability is triggered when processing specific data or requests by the libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an attacker gaining the ability to perform unauthorized actions which may result in a partial loss of integrity or availability. The specific impact mentioned is unauthorized read access to some Java SE and Java SE Embedded accessible data, or a partial loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, indicating that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely. However, this requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted data or requests over the network to trigger the vulnerability.
The attacker also needs the ability to get a user to interact with the crafted request.

**Technical Details:**

*   **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 3.1 (LOW)
*   **CVSS v3.1 Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    *   **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
    *  **AC:H (High):** The attack complexity is high, requiring specialized crafting of malicious input.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not change the security scope of the application.
    *   **C:L (Low):** Limited impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (None):** No impact on integrity.
    *   **A:N (None):** No impact on availability.

**Affected Products:**

*   The vulnerability affects various products using Oracle Java SE and Java SE Embedded.
    *   Specifically mentioned are: Java SE (versions 7u271, 8u261, 11.0.8, and 15) and Java SE Embedded (version 8u261).
    *   NetApp products incorporating Java SE libraries such as Active IQ Unified Manager, E-Series SANtricity, Cloud Backup, OnCommand Insight, SnapManager for Oracle and SAP.
    *   Also affected are OpenJDK implementations, specifically before versions `8.272_p10`.
*   Multiple other Oracle products are affected as per the Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory.
    *   Includes Oracle Database, Fusion Middleware, Communications, etc.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to apply the security patches provided by the respective vendors (Oracle, NetApp, etc.).
*   For OpenJDK, users need to upgrade to version `8.272_p10` or later.
*   NetApp recommends updating Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for affected products.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the handling of untrusted code in Java SE deployments and can be exploited via crafted input processed through APIs.
