{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The award emoji API only checks read access to the parent noteable, not the note itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control checks when retrieving award emojis on internal notes."
    ],
    "impact": "Users without access to an internal note can view emojis awarded to it, potentially revealing information about the note's content or sentiment.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a request to `/api/v4/projects/:id/issues/:issue_iid/notes/:note_id/award_emoji` with a valid `note_id`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the issue the internal note is attached to, and obtain the `note_id`, which can potentially be obtained from email notifications if they previously had access to the note."
  }
