Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0834

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `link_to` parameter within the Elementor Addon Elements plugin. Specifically, the `url` parameter within the 'link' setting of the price-table widget was not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the website
    - Data theft
    - Executing malicious code in the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `link_to` parameter (specifically the 'url' field) of the price table widget.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the link field. This malicious code is stored in the database and executed when the page containing the price table is accessed by any user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Elementor Addon Elements" plugin up to and including 1.12.11.
- The fix is included in version 1.12.12. The vulnerable code was located in `addon-elements-for-elementor-page-builder/trunk/modules/price-table/widgets/price-table.php`. Specifically the `add_link_attributes` function call in `render()` was missing proper escaping.
- The patch replaces ` $this->add_render_attribute( 'button', 'href', $settings['link']['url'] );` with `$this->add_link_attributes( 'button', $settings['link'] );`. This new function correctly sanitizes and escapes the URL.
