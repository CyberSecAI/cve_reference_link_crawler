Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `export_csv.php` file of the EleForms plugin. Specifically, there isn't a verification of user capabilities before allowing access to download form submission data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of a capability check, meaning that the plugin does not verify if the user attempting to download form data has the necessary permissions to do so. This allows unauthenticated users to bypass access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker can download form submissions, which may contain personal or sensitive data entered by users through the forms. This can lead to privacy breaches and potential misuse of the exposed information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can directly access the vulnerable functionality by crafting a specific URL to trigger the download of the CSV file containing form submissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site or have any special privileges. They only need knowledge of the vulnerable URL structure to exploit the issue.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site to make the request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `includes/export_csv.php`
*   The plugin fails to check user capabilities before processing the download request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.9.9.7.
*   The fix is included in version 2.9.9.8 where a check for user capabilities was added
*   The Wordfence article references the specific lines of code modified in the fix commit
