{
  "CVE-2024-39721": {
    "description": "Ollama is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack through the CreateModel API route with a single HTTP request.",
    "root_cause": "The CreateModelHandler function uses os.Open to read a file until completion. When the req.Path parameter is set to /dev/random, which is a blocking device, the goroutine will run infinitely, even after the HTTP request is aborted, leading to extensive resource consumption.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Infinite loop"
    ],
    "impact": "Extensive resource consumption, leading to a denial of service. Repetitive calls to the vulnerable endpoint will rapidly cause the server to become unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to the /api/create endpoint",
      "Setting the `path` parameter to `/dev/random`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker can send HTTP POST requests to the server."
