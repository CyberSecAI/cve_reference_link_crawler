Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of function argument values in the stack trace when the application is in debug mode. Specifically, when argument values exceed 32 characters, they are truncated for display, and the full value is placed in the `title` attribute of a `<span>` tag. The issue arises from the use of `htmlspecialchars` with `ENT_NOQUOTES`, which does not encode double quotes, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML attributes, including JavaScript event handlers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure use of `htmlspecialchars`
- Insufficient input validation and sanitization of function argument values displayed in debug stack traces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the security context of the vulnerable website.
- Potential for stealing cookies (including `httpOnly` cookies).
- Content substitution on the vulnerable page.
- User account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Specifically crafted URL containing malicious code as a function argument.
- The attacker needs to induce an exception to trigger the stack trace display.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to induce an exception in the application running in debug mode.
- The attacker must craft a URL with a long parameter containing a double quote to inject malicious HTML.
- No prior privileges are required on the target system.
- User interaction is required, as the user needs to hover the mouse over the truncated text to trigger the XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Yii Framework version 2.0.49.3.
- It is triggered when the framework is in debug mode (`YII_DEBUG` set to true) and the PHP setting `zend.exception_ignore_args` is set to Off.
- The vulnerable code is located in `framework/web/ErrorHandler.php`.
- The fix involves changing `htmlspecialchars($text, ENT_NOQUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8')` to `htmlspecialchars($text, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8')`, ensuring double quotes are properly encoded.
