Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability that could potentially allow a malicious user to commit unauthorized code to the software by using an uninitialized pointer in the application.  The threat-actor could then execute malicious code on the system affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.  The user would need to open a malicious file provided to them by the attacker for the code to execute.
