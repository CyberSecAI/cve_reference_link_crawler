- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hardcoded TLS keys used by Docker within Brocade SANnav OVA.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded TLS keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is considered low. Although the keys are present, the SANnav product is prevented from communicating with external Docker registries. Knowledge of these keys poses a minimal risk.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector would likely require local access or an attacker that already has a high level of privilege on the Brocade SANnav system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need high privileges on the Brocade SANnav system to potentially leverage the hardcoded TLS keys, and would need knowledge of the keys themselves.
