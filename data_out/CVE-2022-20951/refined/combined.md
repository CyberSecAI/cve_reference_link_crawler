For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broadworks-ssrf-BJeQfpp>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2022-20958: Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device as the bworks user. This would allow the attacker to read arbitrary files in the file system and or interrupt some of the running processes.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd06681](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd06681)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20958Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H  **CVE-2022-20951: Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the Cisco BroadWorks server and other devices on the network.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwd04685](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd04685), [CSCwd58339](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd58339)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20951Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  In the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The second column indicates whether a patch for these vulnerabilities was released and the release number through which the patch can be found. The right columns list the file names of the available patches. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.       | Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Release | First Fixed Release | Patch Filename for CVE-2022-20958 | Patch Filename for CVE-2022-20951 |   | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 23.0 | Migrate to a fixed release.1 | - | - |   | 23.0 | CommPilot-23 version 2022.11\_1.273 | AP.as.23.0.1075.ap383998AP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap383998 | AP.as.23.0.1075.ap384389AP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap384389 |   | 24.0 | CommPilot-24 version 2022.11\_1.273 | AP.as.24.0.944.ap383998 | AP.as.24.0.944.ap384389 |   | 25.0 | CommPilot-25 version 2022.11\_1.273 | - | - |      1.
