- **Root cause:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain confidential information from the Cisco BroadWorks server and other devices on the network by exploiting the SSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the web interface.
