SUMMARY

SICAM PAS/PQS before V8.06 is affected by three vulnerabilities which could lead to remote code
execution, privilege escalation or the creation of a denial of service condition.

Siemens has released several updates for SICAM PAS/PQS and recommends to update to the latest
version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of
the grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM PAS/PQS is an energy automation solution for operating an electrical substation with its devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43722

Affected software does not properly secure a folder containing library ﬁles. This could allow an attacker
to place a custom malicious DLL in this folder which is then run with SYSTEM rights when a service is
started that requires this DLL. At the time of assigning the CVE, the affected ﬁrmware version of the
component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions.

CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43723

Affected software does not properly validate the input for a certain parameter in the s7ontcp.dll. This
could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send messages and create a denial of service
condition as the application crashes. At the time of assigning the CVE, the affected ﬁrmware version
of the component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43724

Affected software transmits the database credentials for the inbuilt SQL server in cleartext.
In
combination with the by default enabled xp_cmdshell feature unauthenticated remote attackers could
execute custom OS commands. At the time of assigning the CVE, the affected ﬁrmware version of the
component has already been superseded by succeeding mainline versions.
