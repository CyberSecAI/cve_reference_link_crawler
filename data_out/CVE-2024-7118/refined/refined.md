*   **Database Access:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/department_viewmore.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious `id` Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the `id` parameter of the URL to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL (`/department_viewmore.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** The vulnerability affects the Online-Payroll-Management-System up to commit `a8902bf64575e325f6d6bf93a55f7bd273ec58cd`.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided information includes a proof of concept demonstrating the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
*   **HTTP Request Example:** The provided HTTP request demonstrates a basic GET request to the vulnerable URL with a sample `id` parameter, which can be modified to exploit the vulnerability.
