The provided content describes a vulnerability in Casdoor, specifically versions up to 1.335.0, where sensitive information is accessible due to insufficient directory access restrictions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Failure to properly restrict directory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unprotected access to sensitive files, such as the database account password and other potentially confidential information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of database account passwords and other sensitive files, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the Casdoor application and its associated data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the improperly protected directory where sensitive files are stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access the directory containing sensitive files, which may be through local file system access, or perhaps a web directory traversal vulnerability (though this is not specified).
