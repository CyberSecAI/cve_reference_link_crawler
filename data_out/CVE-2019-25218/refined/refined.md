**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient escaping of the user-supplied 'id' parameter and a lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrator-level access or higher can inject malicious SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the 'id' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level privileges or higher.
