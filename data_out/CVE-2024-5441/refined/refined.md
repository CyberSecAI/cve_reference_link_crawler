Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5441

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing file type validation in the `set_featured_image` function within the Modern Events Calendar plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin fails to properly validate the type of files being uploaded, allowing attackers to upload any file type, including malicious ones.
- **Insecure File Handling:** Lack of sanitization during file uploads and storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), attackers can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking full control of the website and its underlying server.
- **Website Compromise:** Attackers can modify website content, steal sensitive data, install backdoors, or conduct other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet.
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a file through the plugin's vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have at least a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site.
- **Unauthenticated (Potentially):** If the plugin's settings are configured to allow unauthenticated users to submit events, then the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Modern Events Calendar plugin up to and including version 7.11.0.
- The vulnerability is present in both the free "Lite" and premium versions of the plugin.
- Wordfence has reported blocking 16 attacks in the past 24 hours targeting the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Foxyyy.
- The patched version is 7.12.0.

**Summary:**
The Modern Events Calendar plugin has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that allows authenticated users (or potentially unauthenticated users) to upload any file type, including malicious scripts, potentially leading to remote code execution and full website compromise.

**Recommendation:**
- Update the Modern Events Calendar plugin to version 7.12.0 or a newer patched version as soon as possible.
