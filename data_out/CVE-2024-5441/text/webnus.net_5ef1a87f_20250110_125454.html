Great calendar, very feature-rich. My clients love it. 🙂
The Elementor addon is really promising, for now it lets you create identical widgets (as the mail templates). Hope they will give us more creative freedom in next updates.

If I could give you 6 stars I would. I have tried virtually every calendar plugin on the market. Besides the fact that this is by far the best one, the customer support is simply the best I've ever had with any purchase. I can't give you guys enough credit for an outstanding product and outstanding support. Thank You!

It’s exactly what I have wanted since FOREVER. Thank you, Webnus, for finally making it happen. A quick trial of the lite version showed me how easy it is to use, and how valuable the pro version and add-ons will be. (Great how-to videos, BTW!) Looking forward to putting MEC to good use!

In fact, I have many reasons for a positive rating, but the most important reason is a great set of thoughtful functions of this plugin. This calendar helped to create on my site the necessary functionality with an adaptive and modern design. And I'm sad that I can't use all the plugin functions, because there are too many of them. 🙂

I have tested most of the “Popular” and “well established” calendar plugins. This was exactly what I wanted. We use the premium version for our customer training calendar on our company DIVI site and the lite version on our private Intranet site (Astra Pro and Elementor Pro) for scheduling events.

Out of the box this plugin looks great. All the other plugins I've used for events have had poor styling and required a lot of extra editing to make them presentable. I haven't ran into any problems thus far with this program, the support has been fantastic and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.

This plugin looks very stylish and works great. It is also well supported for updates which is reassuring. My client is very happy with it because it is fairly easy to use once it’s set up. Thanks for your hard work on this plugin!

[Full review in Cloudways.com →](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/modern-events-calendar-wordpress-plugin-review/)

As the name suggests, the core benefit of Modern Events Calendar is that it lets you create an events calendar that looks pretty great out of the box. That latter part is important because some popular event calendar plugins require a lot of custom styling to make them look good, which is tough if you don’t know your way around CSS. Modern Events Calendar lets you create great-looking event displays right out of the box, along with advanced features like ticketing and a custom event display builder.

## FAQ

Does MEC integrate with Gutenberg, Elementor and other page builders?

MEC integrates with the Gutenberg Page Builder as well and in addition to Elementor it supports other popular page builders such as Divi Builder, King Composer and WPBakery Page Builder.

Is the license lifetime or do I have to renew it?

Our license plans provide one year of premium support and auto-updates. After that period your account won't get disabled and you’ll still have full access to your Pro version, however you will need to renew it yearly for future updates and premium support.

Can I try MEC out before I buy it?

The best way to test & try MEC out is by using the MEC Lite version that is available in the WordPress repository.

Are addons on the MEC Pro or should I purchase them separately?

No, MEC Pro and add-ons are all purchased separately. It is a one-time payment that offers you lifetime updates for the products. Keep in mind that each license works only on 1 domain/website.

Do addons need the MEC Pro to work?

Some of the add-ons need the MEC Pro plugin to work, however, some of them work with the Lite version as well. Click below link to find out what add-ons require the MEC Pro to work.
