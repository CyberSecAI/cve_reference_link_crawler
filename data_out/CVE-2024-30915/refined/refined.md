Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-30915.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation when setting the `max_samples` parameter in the DataReader's QoS (Quality of Service) settings. Specifically, a user can set an extremely large value for `max_samples`, which leads to excessive memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation for `max_samples` in DataReader QoS.
- Uncontrolled memory allocation based on user-provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The excessive memory allocation can cause the process to crash due to high RAM usage, eventually being killed by the operating system.
- Potential sensitive information disclosure: The crash may expose sensitive information stored in memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to set the DataReader QoS parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the application's configuration, particularly the DataReader QoS settings.
- This is typically achievable through local access to the system.

**Technical details:**
- The issue is triggered by setting `dr_qos.resource_limits.max_samples` to a very large number (e.g., 900000000).
- The vulnerability is present in the `subscriber->create_datareader` function.
- The `Oppends_poc.cpp` file (lines 122-137) demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is similar to issue #4388, but with a reader instead of a writer.
- The provided PoC project, `DataReaderQos_poc.zip`, can reproduce the issue.
- The issue was closed as "not planned" with the comment "The responsiblity of the user", despite the potential for fatal memory leaks.
