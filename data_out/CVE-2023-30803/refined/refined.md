Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-30803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The primary root cause is insufficient input sanitization within the Sangfor NGAF's web interface and CGI binary. Specifically, user-provided data, such as the username during login and the PHPSESSID cookie, is directly passed to shell commands via `popen` and `echo` without proper escaping or validation. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Using the `Y-Forwarded-For` header with the value `127.0.0.1` allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks in `CFrontController.php`, gaining access to various unauthenticated endpoints. This occurs because the code directly checks the `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` against a hardcoded "localhost" IP and bypasses authentication checks if matched. The `mod_rpaf` module improperly allows setting of this header by clients, causing the bypass.
2. **Source Code Disclosure**: Providing a non-numeric value in the `Content-Length` header when requesting a PHP file triggers a 413 error response which, unexpectedly, includes the PHP source code in the body. This is caused by an integer handling issue in the CGI handler.
3. **Local File Read**: The `loadfile.php` script is vulnerable to path traversal. An attacker can use a crafted `file` parameter to read arbitrary files from the system.
4. **Remote Command Execution (RCE)**:
   - **Via Username Field (Port 85)**: The `remoteLogin()` function in `CFWLogInOutDAO.php` takes the username input from the login form and executes a shell command using `popen`. By injecting a semicolon and commands into the username field, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.
   - **Via PHPSESSID Cookie (Port 4433)**: The CGI binary responsible for login on port 4433 executes a shell command that uses the `PHPSESSID` cookie, which allows command injection using backticks and arbitrary command execution.
5. **Insecure Session Management**: Session cookies are passed via `GET` requests, are logged in plain text in access logs, and are stored in clear text config files which can be read via the file read vulnerability.
6. **SQL injection vulnerability in User setting:** A SQL injection vulnerability exists when using the `SetUserSSOInfo` function in the `User` controller, allowing a user to manipulate the database, however due to the use of `SQLite` this was of limited impact.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise**: Successful exploitation of the RCE vulnerabilities can grant an attacker complete control over the Sangfor NGAF appliance, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands, potentially pivot to the internal network, and gain access to sensitive data.
- **Data Exposure**: The local file read vulnerability exposes sensitive information from the file system, including session cookies, user credentials, configuration settings and system files.
- **Unauthorized Access**: The authentication bypass allows attackers to access sensitive areas of the application and perform unauthorized actions, like adding unauthorized SSL VPN users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests**: All vulnerabilities can be exploited through crafted HTTP requests to the Sangfor NGAF's web interface or CGI entry points. These include:
    -  Login forms (`/LogInOut.php` and `/cgi-bin/login.cgi`)
    -  Specific web service paths (`/vmp_getinfo`, `/svpn_html/loadfile.php`, `/svpn_html/delegatemodule/HttpHandler.php`)
    - Requests to any PHP files with a non-numeric `Content-Length` header

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access**: The attacker needs network access to the Sangfor NGAF appliance.
- **No Authentication Required**: All vulnerabilities, including the RCEs and file read, are exploitable pre-authentication, except for the SQL injection, which does require bypassing the authentication first.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests**: The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, including setting specific headers (e.g., `Y-Forwarded-For`) and modifying POST data and cookies.
- **Optional External Server**: For RCE via port 85, an external web server is required to host the payload which the compromised appliance retrieves.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content from `labs.watchtowr.com` provides significantly more technical detail and step-by-step analysis of how the vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited, than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code snippets, request examples, and screenshots demonstrating the exploitation process.
- The vendor, Sangfor, initially dismissed some of the findings as "false positives" or claimed they were known issues with patches already available.
