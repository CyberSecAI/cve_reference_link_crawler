Today, we’re not here to change your expectations of us - we’re looking at more enterprise-grade software and appliances.</p><p>Today, we’re looking at Sangfor’s Next Gen Application Firewall (NGAF). </p><p>Sangfor (or, Sangfor Technologies) is a "Chinese manufacturer of network equipments including WAN optimization, Next-Generation Firewall, and SSL VPN, sells its products mainly to midsize enterprises".</p><p>Sangfor describe themselves as being the right-place for “effective cybersecurity and efficient enterprise cloud solutions”. We know this (in addition to ‘because they say it on their website’), because “At Sangfor, we believe in providing only the best IT architecture and security solutions for our clients”. </p><p>Here’s a little from Sangfor about their NGAF:</p><p><strong>“Sangfor NGAF is the world's first AI-enabled and fully integrated NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) + WAF (Web Application Firewall) with an all-around protection from all threats powered by innovations such as Neural-X and Engine Zero. It is a truly secured, integrated and simplified firewall solution, providing a holistic overview of the entire organization's security network, with ease of management for administration, operation &amp; maintenance.”</strong></p><p>Brilliant.</p><p>Before you go on this journey with us, we want to be explicitly clear - Sangfor has told us all the vulnerabilities in this blog post are either <strong>a) already fixed or b) false-positives</strong>.<strong> We're not claiming 0days.</strong> Therefore, we are thrilled to share our analysis of old vulnerabilities and what we are led to believe (by Sangfor) is intentional behaviour by design, and ultimately are just glad we didn’t need to apply our 90-day disclosure policy.</p><p>Inquisitive minds might say “where are the public advisories to warn clients of these already existing and patched vulnerabilities?”. Inquisitive minds might also ask how such vulnerabilities ever made their way into production, security appliances in the first place? Luckily, we are not inquisitive and are happy to not question these mundane things.</p><p>Anyway, we digress. As obsessive readers of our blog posts will know, we regularly target enterprise technology that we see in the attack surfaces of the organisations we are proud to work with.</p><p>Obsessive readers will also be familiar with our deep obsession with secure firewall and VPN appliances - we’re not full of imagination, we just want our entry point into networks.</p><h3 id="looking-for-fish">Looking for fish</h3><p>In previous blog posts, we’ve shown in quite some detail the extensive steps taken to break an application - the extraction of HTTP routes, hunting of parameters, and how we qualify portions of functionality as ‘of interest’ in the target software we’re breaking. However, before all that can take place, a decision has to be made - is the target of interest, and worth an investment of time at all?</p><p>This type of decision can be influenced by widely varying factors, such as code complexity, real-world impact, security transparency (ha ha), and in this particular case, the ‘hacker sixth sense’ - does it exude the tell-tale of potentially weak software?</p><p>Sangfor’s NGAF caught our attention as a potential target for research, mostly due to its lack of CVE disclosures. This usually indicates that either the security community has yet to pillage its code, the appliance in question truly is secure or the ever more likely answer - a bug bounty program littered with NDAs and similar type agreements mystifies the security process!</p><p>We were able to gain access to an image of Sangfor's NGAF on AWS via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uujwjffddxzp4?ref=labs.watchtowr.com">https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uujwjffddxzp4</a> using the build version <strong>AF8.0.17.364</strong>.</p><p>	</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1435" srcset="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image.png 600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image.png 1000w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image.png 1600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Based on redirect behaviour, port and server banner iis8.0</span></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>Before getting into the grimey depths of code and workflows, theres a variety of tips n tricks we can use from a bird eye view to calculate the ‘pot odds’ of success. These ‘pot odds’ will help us decide how likely we are to find a bug, and thus, how much time and effort we should spend auditing the target.</p><p>Much to many critics dismay, the first ‘tell’ we see in the codebase is the fact that this supposedly “Next Generation” appliance utilises a mixture of PHP and C++ CGI binaries. We’ve previously seen how custom PHP applications can end in security heartache, and you only have to look at our recent deep dive into Juniper Firewalls for an example - but don’t take our word for it, even Sangfor’s developers have a poor opinion of PHP and we couldn’t agree more.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="478" srcset="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-1.png 600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image-1.png 1600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-1.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It’s also interesting to note that codebases that contain such profanity are a ‘tell’ in themselves - the developers either didn’t intend this code to be viewed by the public, or simply didn’t care about looking unprofessional - in our opinion.</p><p>Clearly, our ‘pot odds’ are looking pretty good.</p><h3 id="when-server-side-becomes-client-side">When server-side becomes client-side..</h3><p>Other than looking for profanity and comments within the application's code base, we first just give the appliance the proverbial kicking of the tires.</p><p>As we get a feel for the appliance, we begin to probe for interesting behaviour that might reveal inner workings of the tech stack and architecture of the solution.</p><p>Very quickly, we stumble into a <em>‘tell</em>’ to raise the bet significantly on the Sangfor NGAF.</p><p>When making a request for the target server’s PHP files, should a non-numeric value be present in the <code>Content-Length</code> header, the server responds with a HTTP Status 413 (”content too large”).

</code></pre><p>A few hours later, after staring hard at our screens, we made a decision that this is probably not intended (Sangfor disagreed).</p><p>As an educated guess, what we’re most likely looking at is an integer handling issue that happens somewhere in the CGI handler. Unfortunately typically sensitive files (a config.php, etc) that would be useful in a vulnerability primative of this type for escalating access, were not.</p><p>Whilst the above behaviour was of interest, we didn’t find ourselves satisfied with the level of mayhem achieved - but did feel that we’d proven to ourselves that this appliance had likely met the bar for ‘interesting’. Thus, it was time to dig in.</p><h3 id="shuffle-up-and-deal">Shuffle up and deal</h3><p>For our friends following along at home we quickly enumerated services exposed using the command: <code>lsof -nP -i | grep LISTEN</code>  from a local shell on the NGAF. As a tl;dr, we were able to see that we have two HTTPS services open, listening on 0.0.0.0;</p><ul><li>Port 85/TCP, running the ‘Firewall Report Center’, and ,</li><li>Port 4433/TCP, running the ‘Administrator Login Portal’.</li></ul><p>Naturally, we dived into port <code>85/TCP</code> .</p><p>Mapping out entry points into this service - defined within an Apache config located at <code>/etc/apache/conf.new/original/httpd.conf</code> .</p><p>When looking to understand the metaphorical attack surface exposed by an appliance and specifically within Apache web server config files, we look for <code>Location</code>, <code>ScriptAlias</code> and <code>Alias</code> directives. Doing so usually provides us with a nice list of endpoints and exposed directories, and indeed in the case of this secure, hardened AI-powered Sangfor device, the presented results include a rich list of possibilities:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">Alias /icons/ "/virus/apache/apache/icons/"
Alias /bbc "/virus/webui/ext/fast_deploy.html"
Alias /manual/ "/virus/apache/apache/htdocs/manual/"

Alias /proxy.html "/virus/webui/ext/login.php"

</code></pre><p>However, attempting to access any of these items resulted in redirection to authenticate - at <code>LogInOut.php</code>.</p><p>Post-authentication bugs are not of interest to us though - we have a higher-calling for pre-authenticated vulnerabilities only. Time to look at the Apache config again.</p><p>Further analysis of this config reveals a <code>RewriteRule</code> rule, which rewrites all requests to <code>index.php</code>, which contains several <code>require</code> ’s and more importantly - a call to a controller class.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">require_once(CLASS_COMMON_PATH."dispatch/CFrontController.php");

$t_objFrontController = new CFrontController();

The code is a little bit of a forest to trace, and so we used  <code>pspy</code> to assist. </p><p>Pspy is a useful little tool, often used by CTF teams, which will sit in the background and log all processes being spawned and their arguments - very good for spotting command injection, which we suspected would be the quickest route to RCE.</p><p>Placing the <code>pspy</code> binary on the target box, along with the grep command, allows visibility into what was being spawned by the Apache process:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="377" srcset="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-9.png 600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-9.png 1000w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image-9.png 1600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-9.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After running this through all the controllers and functions again, we were still unable to locate any clear points of injection.

Good job CAPTCHA.</p><p>Looking through the file <code>CFWLogInOutDAO.php</code> we can find the <code>remoteLogin()</code> function responsible for this:</p><pre><code class="language-php">public function remoteLogin(&amp;$in_arrSearchCondition)

		return false;
	}
</code></pre><p>Ironically, the developers call <code>addslashes()</code> on the username before processing within in a SQL statement, but no sanitisation before using it within the <code>popen()</code> function. Oops!</p><p>After some time playing around, we realised it was not possible to inject just any old special character in the username, as quotes and backticks (and even the logical operators  <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code>) were not allowed due to <code>mod_security</code>. However, we noticed it could truncate the command with a semicolon.</p><p>Being the attention-seekers that we are, we wanted magical output that showed execution of the command from a single HTTP request to response - and thus, we had to get creative. The response details a static error message which is declared within the file <code>/virus/dcweb/conf/lang/eng.utf8.lang.app.php</code> .</p><p>Our new life goal was to write a command that outputs to this error message. Typically (we like this word), you would use some kind of encoding to get around the <code>‘ “</code> and <code>mod_security</code> limitations but <code>base64</code> and <code>xxd</code> are not available on the appliance. To circumvent this we went with the following path to a winning hand:</p><ol><li>Hosting the payload externally on an HTTP server</li><li>Fetch the payload using <code>wget</code></li><li>Execute the payload via <code>source</code> - We thought it was cooler than <code>.</code></li><li><code>sed</code> replace the error message with the value of <code>$(id)</code></li></ol><p>What we’re left with is this awesome screenshot showing the win all in one place:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="541" srcset="https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/image-13.png 600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/image-13.png 1000w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/10/image-13.png 1600w, https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/10/image-13.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Request:</p><pre><code class="language-php">POST /LogInOut.php HTTP/1.1

That would give us our chance to concoct a more sophisticated attack path, and gain more attention/Internet points.</p><p>The attack surface is slightly different on port 4433, in that the native flow authenticates via a C++ CGI file rather than via PHP. We toyed with the idea of spending our evenings in Ghidra analysing it, but the thought crossed our minds that perhaps the same developer who designed the login PHP script on port 85/TCP also developed the CGI modules, and maybe.. just maybe...</p><p>Inspired with that thought, we attempted the login flow with <code>pspy</code> still running. Using the same principle, we attempted to login with an incorrect username… lo and behold, another shell command is executed in a slightly different format.

We hope this write-up changes that mindset - even an entry-level offensive-security lab course is very relevant for a widely-used and ‘next generation’ product such as this one.</p><p>By now, regular readers will be well aware that we love picking on such ‘hardened’ appliances here at watchTowr. Indeed, with bugs like these, it’s hard not to be interested - we’d encourage everyone with an interest in bug-hunting to pick up their nearest ‘next generation’ or ‘enterprise-grade’ firewall or VPN endpoint and start tearing it to pieces.</p><p>The real lesson here, for network defenders, is that we can’t assume these hardened devices are, well, hardened at all.
