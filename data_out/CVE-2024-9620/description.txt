A flaw was found in Event-Driven Automation (EDA) in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), which lacks encryption of sensitive information. An attacker with network access could exploit this vulnerability by sniffing the plaintext data transmitted between the EDA and AAP. An attacker with system access could exploit this vulnerability by reading the plaintext data stored in EDA and AAP databases.
