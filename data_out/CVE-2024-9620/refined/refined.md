Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9620

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of encryption for sensitive information within the Event-Driven Automation (EDA) component of Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Plaintext storage and transmission of sensitive data such as credentials (e.g., ServiceNow credentials).
- Failure to use AAP's built-in encryption features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with network access can sniff and intercept plaintext data transmitted between EDA and AAP.
- An attacker with system access can read plaintext data stored in the EDA and AAP databases. This exposes sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network sniffing: Intercepting data transmitted over the network.
- System access: Directly accessing the database or file system where sensitive information is stored in plaintext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the system running EDA and AAP.
- System access to the server/database where EDA and AAP data is stored.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) versions up to and including 2.4.
- The vulnerability is due to the Event-Driven Automation (EDA) component not using built-in AAP encryption features.
- Specifically mentioned is the lack of encryption of credentials when using integrations such as the ServiceNow integration.
