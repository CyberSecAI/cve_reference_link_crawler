The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2023-47167.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `uhttpd` service of the TP-Link ER7206 Omada Gigabit VPN Router. The `remote_gateway` parameter in the GRE policy configuration is used directly in a shell command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability via the `remote_gateway` parameter in GRE policy configuration.
- Lack of input sanitization when constructing the shell command.
- The `uhttpd` service running as root, exacerbating the impact.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the device.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the router, including the ability to execute any command with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<token>/admin/gre?form=overipsec` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious request with shell metacharacters in the `remote_gateway` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality on the web interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.
