- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unrestricted file upload of .php files through the `HelpdeskHelpdeskModuleFrontController::submitTicket()` and `HelpdeskHelpdeskModuleFrontController::replyTicket()` methods within the "Help Desk - Customer Support Management System" module for PrestaShop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.
    - CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') due to the ability to upload and execute PHP code.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Critical vulnerability leading to potential remote code execution on the server.
    - Attackers can gain admin access, remove data, or steal data from the associated PrestaShop installation.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attack.
    - Exploitation is done through the PrestaShop front controller, where the module controller's path can be concealed. The attacker can use the POST request to upload a malicious PHP file without revealing the exploit in conventional frontend logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Low privilege: Requires a valid customer account on the PrestaShop platform.
    - Low attack complexity.
    - No user interaction needed.
    - Network access to the application.
