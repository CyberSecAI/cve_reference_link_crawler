| post | [CVE-2024-34990] Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in FME Modules - Help Desk - Customer Support Management System module for PrestaShop | modules | | TouchWeb.fr | 202 Ecommerce | | --- | --- | | CVE,PrestaShop,helpdesk | critical (9.9) |

In the module "Help Desk - Customer Support Management System" (helpdesk) up to version 2.4.0 from FME Modules for PrestaShop, a customer can upload .php files.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2024-34990](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34990)
* **Published at**: 2024-06-18
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: helpdesk
* **Impacted release**: < 2.4.0 (2.4.0 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: FME Modules
* **Weakness**: [CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.9)

## Description

Methods `HelpdeskHelpdeskModuleFrontController::submitTicket()` and `HelpdeskHelpdeskModuleFrontController::replyTicket()` allow upload of .php files on a predictable path for connected customers, it will lead to a critical vulnerability [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod\_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: low
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: changed
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Steal data

## Proof of concept

1. Connect as customer
2. Go to the customer ticket's dashboard
3. Submit a ticket or Reply to an existing one, with a .php file in attachment

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **helpdesk**.
* Activate OWASP 933's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
