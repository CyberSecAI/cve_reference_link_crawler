{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/recoverpassword.html` endpoint allows an attacker to obtain the `netmanid` from the UPS. This ID, along with a secret key, is used in an algorithm to calculate the password recovery code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated access to password recovery functionality",
      "Predictable password recovery code generation algorithm based on a known secret key"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can reset the UPS password to 'admin:admin', gaining full control of the UPS. This allows the attacker to perform actions like turning the UPS off, leading to potential disruption of operations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the device's web interface."
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have network access to the UPS device's web interface and be able to send HTTP requests."

      "NetMan 204 / 4.05"

     "solution": "None provided by the vendor. The advisory recommends limiting access to the device and not using the device in productive networks.",
