- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unauthorized information disclosure vulnerability exists due to insufficient access controls on `diagnose debug` commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor [CWE-200].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to a restricted administrative account can obtain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the use of `diagnose debug` commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have obtained access to a restricted administrative account on the affected devices.
