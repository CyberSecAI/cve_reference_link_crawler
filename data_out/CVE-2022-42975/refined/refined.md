Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of wildcard subdomain matching in the `check_origin` functionality of Phoenix Channels. The code used `String.ends_with?` to compare the request origin against allowed origins, but it failed to properly account for the subdomain dot prefix when a wildcard (`*.`) was used. This allowed origins with a prefix attached to the wildcard to pass the check, when they should have been blocked. For example, `api.any-other.com` was incorrectly allowed for the wildcard `*.other.com`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Wildcard Matching:** The core issue is the flawed logic in `compare_host?`, specifically, `String.ends_with?(request_host, allowed_host)` did not properly validate wildcard subdomains.
- **Bypass Origin Checks:** Due to the improper wildcard matching, an attacker could register a domain with a custom prefix of a target domain and bypass origin checks for websocket connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthenticated Channel Connections:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to establish unauthenticated channel connections from a malicious host.
- **Limited Impact on LiveView and Token-Based Auth:** The impact is mitigated if LiveView is used (due to its CSRF token) or if the application uses token-based authentication, as the attacker would need a valid CSRF token or connection token to perform further actions.
- **No Cookie Access:** Phoenix Channels do not allow access to cookies, limiting the attacker's ability to pass their own cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Origin:** An attacker would register a domain that includes the target domain as a suffix, prefixed by arbitrary characters, such as `api.any-other.com` where `*.other.com` is the allowed wildcard.
- **WebSocket Connection:** The attacker would then attempt to initiate a websocket connection from this malicious domain to the vulnerable Phoenix server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Domain Registration:** The attacker needs to be able to register a domain that includes the target domain as a suffix with an arbitrary prefix.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to connect to the vulnerable Phoenix server.

**Summary of the fix:**
The fix modifies the `compare_host?` function to use `request_host == allowed_host or String.ends_with?(request_host, "." <> allowed_host)` to properly check for subdomains and ensure that the subdomain part is also validated.
