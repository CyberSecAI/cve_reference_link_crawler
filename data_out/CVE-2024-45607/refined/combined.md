# Failure to validate message's signature

Moderate

[Secreto31126](/Secreto31126)
published
GHSA-mwhf-vhr5-7j23
Sep 12, 2024

## Package

npm

whatsapp-api-js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

Incorrect Access Control, anyone using the post or verifyRequestSignature methods to handle messages is impacted.

### Patches

Patched in version 4.0.3.

### Workarounds

It's possible to check the payload validation using the WhatsAppAPI.verifyRequestSignature and expect false when the signature is valid.

```
function doPost(payload, header_signature) {
    if (whatsapp.verifyRequestSignature(payload.toString(), header_signature) {
        throw 403;
    }

    // Now the payload is correctly verified
    whatsapp.post(payload);
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N

I want to fix the verifyRequestSignature method inside `index.ts` file. From the jsdoc docs, the returnred boolean value should indicate that the signature is valid. Hope it helps! :)

| Hm, this is really big if true. If your change does pass the tests, not only it means the whole library was broken, but also the unit tests failed to catch the issue. I can't believe this went thru so easily. |

| Hey [@felixarjuna](https://github.com/felixarjuna), sorry for the harsh reply last week, I got a little too annoyed/scared/excited about the first vulnerability on the library :)  I added you as the finder on the CVE and in the README. Really thankful for your PR and raising this bug, which allowed any payload *except real WhatsApp's* to be processed. I will try to get some time to fix the unit tests in order to avoid similar dumb issues in the future.  Thanks! |
