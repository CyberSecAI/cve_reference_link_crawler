# Failure to validate message's signature

Moderate

published

Sep 12, 2024

## Package

npm

whatsapp-api-js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

4.0.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

Incorrect Access Control, anyone using the post or verifyRequestSignature methods to handle messages is impacted.

### Patches

Patched in version 4.0.3.

### Workarounds

It's possible to check the payload validation using the WhatsAppAPI.verifyRequestSignature and expect false when the signature is valid.

```
function doPost(payload, header_signature) {
    if (whatsapp.verifyRequestSignature(payload.toString(), header_signature) {
        throw 403;
    }

    // Now the payload is correctly verified
    whatsapp.post(payload);
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
