Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6848

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `boldgrid_canvas_image` AJAX endpoint of the Post and Page Builder by BoldGrid plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly validate the MIME type of uploaded files and allows the upload of SVG files containing malicious javascript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS through file uploads, specifically SVG files.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-provided file data, particularly when processing base64 encoded data.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the output, allowing the execution of injected scripts.
- **MIME Type Validation Bypass:** The plugin does not properly validate MIME types, allowing for the upload of malicious files disguised as images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the vulnerable web application by uploading a crafted SVG file.
- **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation may result in unauthorized actions and account takeover.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive information or manipulate data on the affected website.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could inject scripts that redirect users to malicious websites or download malware onto their devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the `boldgrid_canvas_image` AJAX endpoint.
- **SVG File:** The malicious payload is delivered via a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have an account with at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress website.
- **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** Attackers need to have access to the WordPress admin dashboard to use the plugin's functionality.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious SVG File:** Attackers need to be able to create a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript.
