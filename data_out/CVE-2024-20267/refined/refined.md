- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of MPLS traffic, specifically a lack of error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame containing a crafted IPv6 packet. This is identified as CWE-120, which generally relates to buffer overflows but in this context it's a broader issue related to input validation and error handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the netstack process to unexpectedly restart, leading to the device stopping processing network traffic or to a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet encapsulated within an MPLS frame to an MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. The IPv6 packet can originate multiple hops away.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted MPLS encapsulated IPv6 packets to a vulnerable device that has MPLS enabled. No authentication is required.
