This vulnerability is due to lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that is encapsulated within an MPLS frame to an MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  **Note**: The IPv6 packet can be generated multiple hops away from the targeted device and then encapsulated within MPLS. The DoS condition may occur when the NX-OS device processes the packet.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-mpls-dos-R9ycXkwM>  This advisory is part of the February 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: February 2024 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75059).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have MPLS configured:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCwh42690](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh42690))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCva52387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCva52387))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCva52387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCva52387))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCva52387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCva52387))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCva52387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCva52387))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode [(CSCwh42690](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh42690)) For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether a Device is Configured for MPLS To determine whether a device is configured for MPLS, use the **show mpls interface detail** CLI command. If the switch is configured for MPLS and is configured to use MPLS on at least one interface, the output will include **MPLS operational**, as shown in the following example:  ```   nxos# show mpls interface detail Interface Ethernet1/4/1:        ldp enabled        MPLS operational        Label space id 0x10000001        MPLS sub-layer Ethernet1/4/1-mpls layer(0x26000001)Interface Ethernet1/6/1:        ldp enabled        MPLS operational        Label space id 0x10000001        MPLS sub-layer Ethernet1/6/1-mpls layer(0x26000002)   ```  If the **show mpls interface detail** isnot a valid CLI command on the device, the device can be considered not vulnerable. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + Secure Firewall 4200 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.
