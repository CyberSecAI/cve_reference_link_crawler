Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `admin/add_admin.php` file of the Internship Portal Management System 1.0. Specifically, the application does not check the legitimacy of user-provided data for the `password`, `name`, and `username` parameters before incorporating them into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses unsanitized user input in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.
- This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, data deletion, or potentially complete control of the database server.
- Attackers can use this to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious input to the `password`, `name`, and `username` parameters of the `admin/add_admin.php` file.
- The attacker manipulates these parameters with crafted SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `admin/add_admin.php` file with manipulated `password`, `name`, and `username` parameters.
- No special privileges are needed initially; the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely once they can access the vulnerable page.
