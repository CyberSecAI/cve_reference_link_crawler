- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ditty plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its blocks' settings, specifically the "Tiny MCE" block's main text field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with author-level privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a Ditty item and adding a "Tiny MCE" block, then inserting malicious JavaScript code into the main text field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have author-level privileges on the WordPress site.
