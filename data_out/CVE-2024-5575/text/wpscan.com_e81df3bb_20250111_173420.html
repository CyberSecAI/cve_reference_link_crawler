## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ditty < 3.1.43 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its blocks' settings, which could allow high privilege users such as authors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create a new Ditty and add "Tiny MCE" block. Change main text field to <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

### Affects Plugins
