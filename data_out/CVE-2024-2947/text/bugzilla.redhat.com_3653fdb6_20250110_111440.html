| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2024-03-26 14:25:02 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Cockpit. Deleting a sosreport with a crafted name via the Cockpit web interface can lead to a command injection vulnerability, resulting in privilege escalation.  Reference: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/ee8f946df39779ee37071006d1d4826317f25c9a>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/9c4cc9b6df632082538b53bdc8ee9ec1c5cad4da>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c3)  Martin Pitt    2024-03-27 05:22:58 UTC  ``` Precise pointer to the flaw: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/ee8f946df39779ee37071006d1d4826317f25c9a#diff-62c94c14cb8793bb67e4f27c6c067095648a9d3f185c66f0d0dde300219e9bd1R232>  Adding Marius. I quickly discussed that issue with him. My main concern was about the purpose of that glob, as it's not obvious why it's even there. Seems it's really just to also cover the sosreport*.gpg signature. So a proper fix would look something like this:    cockpit.file(path, { superuser: true }).replace(null);   cockpit.file(path + ".gpg", { superuser: true }).replace(null);  Plus strengthening the integration test [1] to make sure that no /var/tmp/{base_report}* files are present (ironically, *that* place should use a glob :-) ), i.e. that we clean up all files just in case there is or ever will be something else than just *.gpg.  Marius, WDYT? (Please note: no pushing fixes anywhere, just discussing in this issue until the embargo gets lifted)  [1] <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/ee8f946df39779ee37071006d1d4826317f25c9a#diff-a5be77b91c9305612a9dd01559e56d53c7802281fd6bc8df606a63020117e1d1R115>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c4)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2024-03-27 12:54:45 UTC  ``` Created cockpit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2271815](show_bug.cgi?id=2271815 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2024-2947 cockpit: command injection when deleting a sosreport with a crafted name [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c5)  Martin Pitt    2024-03-27 14:01:21 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/20232>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-06 08:42:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:3667 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3667](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3667)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2271614#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-06-11 19:25:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:3843 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3843](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A3843)   ``` |  |
