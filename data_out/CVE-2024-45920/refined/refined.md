Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Intrest" feature of the Solvait application. This allows malicious script injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before storing and rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves modifying the `intrest` parameter in a request to the `update_intrest` endpoint, injecting the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify requests made to the application.
- The attacker must have an account on the system to access the profile page and make the necessary request to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is named "intrest".
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/Accountlogin/update_intrest`.
- The vulnerability affects Solvait version 24.4.2.
- The steps to reproduce the vulnerability are detailed in the document, outlining how to navigate to the profile page, intercept the request, modify the `intrest` parameter with a payload, send the modified request, and view the executed JavaScript after a refresh.
