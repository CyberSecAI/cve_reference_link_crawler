- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in query analysis of complex self-referential `$lookup` subpipelines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Failure to encrypt literal values in expressions for encrypted fields. These values are sent to the server as plaintext instead of ciphertext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If the vulnerability is triggered, no documents would be returned or written. The primary risk is the exposure of sensitive data in plaintext format during transmission to the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting this vulnerability requires crafting specific, complex self-referential `$lookup` subpipelines that trigger the bug in query analysis.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be able to craft queries against a MongoDB database using Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) and Queryable Encryption. The attacker would need to use these features in a way that triggers the specific bug.
