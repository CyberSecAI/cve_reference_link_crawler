- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature within the firmware metadata signature validation mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper verification of cryptographic signature, leading to bypass of signature validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass signature validation and potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of root when combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the device. Authentication is not required.
