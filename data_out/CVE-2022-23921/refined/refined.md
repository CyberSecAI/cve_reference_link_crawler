Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Specifically, the vulnerability allows a user to escalate their privileges and execute code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly manage privileges, allowing for privilege escalation.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve both code execution and local privilege escalation, potentially leading to unauthorized control of the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine running CIMPLICITY is required. Additionally, the CIMPLICITY server must not be running a project, and the server must be licensed for multiple projects for the exploit to be possible.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have login access to a machine actively running the vulnerable Proficy CIMPLICITY software. They also need the ability to initiate an exploit when the CIMPLICITY server is not running a project, on a system that is licensed for multiple projects.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Proficy CIMPLICITY v11.1 and prior versions.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 7.5 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) which indicates:
    *   **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L)
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
    *   **Privileges Required (PR):** Low (L)
    *   **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)
    *   **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
    *   **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)
    *   **Integrity (I):** High (H)
    *   **Availability (A):** High (H)
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
*   The report was made by Yuval Ardon and Roman Dvorkin of OTORIO.
*   GE Digital has released an upgrade in January 2022 as a mitigation. They also recommend following the instructions in their Secure Deployment Guide.
