*   **Data Loss:** Authenticated attackers can delete arbitrary posts.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through AJAX requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
