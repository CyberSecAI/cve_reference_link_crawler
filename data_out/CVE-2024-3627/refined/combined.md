### Description

The Wheel of Life: Coaching and Assessment Tool for Life Coach plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in the AjaxFunctions.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts and modify settings.
