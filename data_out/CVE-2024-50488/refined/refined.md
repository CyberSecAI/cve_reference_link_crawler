- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Token Login plugin for WordPress versions <= 1.0.3 is vulnerable to broken authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Authentication. This allows an attacker to perform actions that should only be executable by higher-privileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can potentially gain admin access to the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the plugin, and a malicious actor can exploit the broken authentication to elevate their privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber (lower privileged user) and leverage the broken authentication to elevate their privileges.
