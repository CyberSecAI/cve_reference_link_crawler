- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `setPath` method in `ResourcePackFileServer.kt` does not validate the provided path, allowing for path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with permission level 1 can make any file on the server publicly accessible via a HTTP server.
- **Attack vectors**: By using a crafted path when calling the `setPath` method of `ResourcePackFileServer.kt`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a player with permission level 1.
