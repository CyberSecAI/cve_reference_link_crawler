- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the ThinServer™ service allows the creation of a junction that points to a target directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269) that allows reading of arbitrary files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A threat actor can disclose sensitive information by reading arbitrary files.
- **Attack vectors**: By abusing the ThinServer™ service to create a junction that points to a target directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to create the junction and access the ThinServer™ service.
