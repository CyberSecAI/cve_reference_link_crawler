| Unfortunately, I am not an expert nor a professional programmer. I need to look into it and read more details on the topic. Are you referring to changes documented [here](https://semgrep.dev/docs/cheat-sheets/python-command-injection/)? Or even better, do you have a proposal on how to fix it with a PR?  Anyhow, it'll take some time. |

| [@pondzikk](https://github.com/pondzikk) Would a check, if logtime is an integer and below a certain value reduce the risk significantly? This could be a short time solution. |

| [@pondzikk](https://github.com/pondzikk) please check if quick solution ([57572c7](https://github.com/PiBrewing/craftbeerpi4/commit/57572c777eec1846273f9418e1029568194ecf07)) would work as start. Only integer values and a 'b' are now forwarded to the system controller. |

| [@pondzikk](https://github.com/pondzikk) Would a check, if logtime is an integer and below a certain value reduce the risk significantly? This could be a short time solution.  Yup, it should work.  I haven't checked fixed version in action, but after reading changes in commit i think it would mitigate this issue. |

| Added [test branch](https://github.com/PiBrewing/craftbeerpi4/commit/f5c242d7c856e8f7be2cac8e8ca4dcb51d779515) that is using systemd-python package instead of os.system to read from journal. Tests started, but reading from log is working already and issue should be solved with the usage of the additional package |
