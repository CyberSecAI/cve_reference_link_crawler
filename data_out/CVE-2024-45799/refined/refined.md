Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of shop names displayed on the vendors/buyers list pages within the FluxCP application. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of input sanitization, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users visiting the affected shop pages. The provided content specifically mentions the potential for session information theft.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript within shop names. This malicious data is then displayed on the vendors/buyers list pages, triggering the code execution when a user visits those pages.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate shop names to inject malicious JavaScript. This would likely involve either creating a shop or somehow modifying existing shop data. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the server itself, but rather the ability to interact with the application in ways that affect data being displayed.
