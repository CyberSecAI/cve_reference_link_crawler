Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-37620:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-37620. It discusses a ReDoS vulnerability in the `html-minifier` library, specifically referencing the vulnerable code and providing discussions about the issue.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression used to handle custom fragments within the html-minifier library. 
- Specifically, the regex `\\s*(?:<%[\\s\\S]*?%>|<\\?[\\s\\S]*?\\?>)+\\s*` is used to identify and temporarily replace custom ignored fragments.
- The unbounded quantifiers `*` and `+` in this regular expression, used with the alternation `(?:...|...)`, can lead to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The primary weakness is the vulnerable regular expression that can cause a significant performance impact.
- **Unbounded quantifiers:** The usage of `*` and `+` without explicit limits allows the regex engine to backtrack excessively.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing malicious input, an attacker can cause the server or application using `html-minifier` to become unresponsive due to excessive CPU consumption while evaluating the vulnerable regex.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through providing specially crafted input to the `minify` function of the `html-minifier` library.
- The vulnerable code is triggered when the input contains custom fragments that need to be ignored by the minifier.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `minify` function of `html-minifier`. This could occur if the attacker can supply HTML or other text to an application that uses `html-minifier`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger this vulnerability. It can be exploited remotely through a network.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

- **Affected Code:** The vulnerable code is located in `htmlminifier.js`, specifically in the section where custom fragments are handled.
- **Proof of Concept:** A simple PoC was provided, initially using a long string of tabs followed by '.\t1x', but later clarified that the issue is triggered by custom fragments and the regex.
- **Mitigation:** Disabling the `ignoreCustomFragments` option, setting a global timeout to prevent resource exhaustion and switching to `html-minifier-terser`, though later determined to also be affected, are possible mitigations.
- **False CVE description:** The CVE description incorrectly pointed to `srcset` attribute processing as the vulnerable code, while in reality, the vulnerability is caused by regex used to process custom fragments.
- **html-minifier-terser also affected:** The replacement library `html-minifier-terser` is also affected by the same vulnerability, though with a different CVE.
- **Downstream impact:** Libraries such as `gulp-htmlmin`, `gulp-html-minifier-terser` and `gulp-htmlclean` are affected.
- **CVSS Score:** High severity with a base score of 8.7 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).

In summary, CVE-2022-37620 is a ReDoS vulnerability in the `html-minifier` library caused by an inefficient regular expression used to handle custom fragments. This can be exploited by an attacker providing specifically crafted input, leading to denial of service. Switching to html-minifier-terser does not resolve this issue.
