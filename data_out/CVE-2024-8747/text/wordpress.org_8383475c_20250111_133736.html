I thought that I should rate and review this plugin for the following reasons
It works well and is very, very, very simple to use
It is free ‚Äì thank you very much
I wish to redress the balance of the 2 people who gave it a 1 star review.
I was quite annoyed when I saw what they wrote about a free, easy to use plugin. If you can‚Äôt use something this simple then maybe you should reconsider doing anything related to WordPress.

The shortcode works in plain html markup as well. It will also send subject, body etc in the email variable if you use them. Thanx for the plugin
