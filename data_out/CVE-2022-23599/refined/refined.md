The content is related to CVE-2022-23599.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `Referer` header in the `image_view_fullscreen.pt` template. The template uses the `Referer` header to redirect users back to the previous page, but it does not properly validate the URL, leading to cache poisoning and open redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `Referer` header, which will be reflected in the page and executed when a user visits the page.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker can craft a malicious `Referer` header pointing to an external site and redirect users there.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Cache poisoning:** An attacker could manipulate the `Referer` header to inject a malicious URL. If this response is cached by intermediary systems like Varnish, subsequent users will receive the poisoned cached page.
*   **XSS:** Malicious scripts can be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Open redirect:** Users can be redirected to malicious sites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to control the `Referer` header of an HTTP request to the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to make an HTTP request to the vulnerable page to inject a malicious `Referer` header.
*   No special privileges are required.
*   User interaction is required: the victim must click a link or otherwise trigger the page containing the manipulated `Referer`.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability affects versions of `Products.ATContentTypes` prior to 3.0.6.
* The advisory mentions that `Products.CMFPlone` in the 4.3 series and `plone.app.contenttypes` in all versions are also vulnerable to the same issue.
* A workaround is provided: to prevent the vulnerable page from being cached.
