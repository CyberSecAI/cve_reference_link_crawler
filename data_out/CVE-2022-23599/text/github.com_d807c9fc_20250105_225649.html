# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') and URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Products.ATContentTypes

Moderate

[mauritsvanrees](/mauritsvanrees)
published
GHSA-g4c2-ghfg-g5rh
Jan 28, 2022

## Package

pip

Products.ATContentTypes
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<3.0.6

## Patched versions

3.0.6

## Description

### Impact

Plone is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image\_view\_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish.

The technique is known as cache poisoning.

Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page.

Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on your cache settings.

### Patches

A new version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix.

This version works on Plone 5.2 (Python 2 only) and will be included in Plone 5.2.7.

Note that the Products.CMFPlone package has the same problem in the 4.3 series.

`plone.app.contenttypes` has the same problem in all versions, see [advisory](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.contenttypes/security/advisories/GHSA-f7qw-5fgj-247x).

For all unpatched versions of the three packages, you can use the following workaround.

### Workaround

Make sure the image\_view\_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache.

In Plone:

* Login as Manager and go to Site Setup.
* Go to the 'Caching' control panel. If this does not exist, or 'Enable caching' is not checked, you should normally not be vulnerable.
* Click on the tab 'Caching operations'.
* Under 'Legacy template mappings' locate the ruleset 'Content item view'.
* From the last column ('Templates') remove 'image\_view\_fullscreen'.
* Click on Save.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
