The provided content is related to CVE-2023-24204.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `get-quote.php` and `login.php` scripts of the SourceCodester Simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection in `get-quote.php`: The `name` parameter is not sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
- SQL Injection in `login.php`: The `email` and `password` parameters are not properly validated, allowing for SQL injection and authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to gain administrative access.
- Data Theft: Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive information from the database.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers can alter, insert, or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- `get-quote.php`: By submitting a quote request with a malicious payload in the `name` parameter.
- `login.php`: By providing a crafted payload in the `email` and `password` fields of the login form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to submit a quote request through the `get-quote.php` form.
- Ability to access the login page (`login.php`).
- Intercept and modify HTTP requests with a tool like Burp Suite (for get-quote.php).
