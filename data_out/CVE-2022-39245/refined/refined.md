Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `mist` application was using the `sudo` binary found in the user's `PATH` environment variable for permission checks. This allows a malicious local user to place a malicious `sudo` binary in their `PATH` which would be executed by `mist`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:**  The application was vulnerable to path traversal via the `PATH` environment variable. The application did not use an absolute path to the `sudo` binary.
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application was using the user-controlled `PATH` environment variable when determining which `sudo` binary to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker could execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by placing a malicious `sudo` binary in their `PATH`. This effectively allows for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system where `mist` is installed.
- The attacker must be able to modify their `PATH` environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user access.
- Ability to modify environment variables, specifically `PATH`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 0.9.5 of `mist` by using the absolute path `/usr/bin/sudo` instead of relying on the `PATH` variable.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-305 (Use of an Inadequate Security Protocol).
