## ReCrystallize Server Features

* Gives your users up-to-the-minute information by refreshing your
  reports' data  from SQL Server, Oracle or practically
  any database.
* Users can view Crystal Reports and other documents by simply clicking
  on the report or file.
* Includes explorer style navigation, great for large numbers of files
  and folders.
* Includes touch-friendly tree style navigation.
* Can automatically update reports every *x* minutes  —
  great for public presentation on a large screen for waiting rooms, order
  fulfillment, and more.
* Can easily integrate your Crystal Reports into your existing website or SharePoint.
* May be used alone or called from your own application.

* Supported on traditional servers, virtual servers, and cloud services
  including AWS and Azure.
* Works with Crystal Reports parameter prompts, including dynamic
  and cascading parameter options retrieved in real time from your database.
* Report parameter values can be preset and encrypted so that end
  users can't see or change the actual parameter value.
* Fully supports subreports, including drill-down capability.
* Reports can be easily emailed, printed or downloaded in PDF, Excel,
  RTF, and other formats.
* Optionally control user access to reports through standard IIS
  web authentication and file permissions on your server.
* Web-based file management allows trusted users to add or remove
  reports and documents without requiring direct access to the server
  file system.  If you prefer, files can be managed with Windows
  Explorer or your favorite file management tool.
* Reports may be opened for viewing directly from an html link, application, or script using a web address similar to

  http://***yourserver***/RecrystallizeServer?ViewReport.apx?reportName=**library.rpt**&Author=**Shakespeare**

  In this example, the library report's Author parameter is preset
  to Shakespeare.

  Reports may also be opened using a
  form post so that you can implement your own user interface or use
  hidden fields.

  Reports may be exported to disk,
  emailed or printed with a similar web link or from a command
  line, batch file, PowerShell script or your app.
