Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-36325:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a context-confusion bug within the bloom filter of the I2P router software. This issue allows an attacker to use replayed messages to determine if a specific router is hosting a targeted hidden service (eepsite).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Message Replay Attack:** The core weakness is the ability to replay a message with a specific message ID.  The bloom filter, which is designed to prevent message reuse, was not correctly separated based on context.
*   **Context Confusion:** The bloom filter did not distinguish between messages coming from client tunnels, exploratory tunnels, or direct messages to the router. This lack of context awareness is what allows the replay attack to work. Specifically, the same bloom filter was used for client-side and router-side checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **De-anonymization:** A successful attack allows the attacker to correlate the public IPv4 or IPv6 address of the I2P router with a specific eepsite hosted on that router. This breaks the anonymity provided by I2P, exposing the location of the hidden service.
*  **Information Leak:** The dropped message reveals to the attacker that the specific router has previously seen the message ID. This allows the attacker to infer a relationship between the router and the hidden service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Replayed I2NP Messages:** Attackers craft a specific I2NP message with a unique message ID, send it to a client tunnel, observe the response, and then replay the same message directly to the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send I2NP messages to I2P routers, implying they are part of the I2P network.
*   **I2P Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs a detailed understanding of the I2P protocol, specifically how to craft and replay I2NP messages.
*   **Time and Resources:** The attack can take several days to complete, requires sending traffic across the I2P network, and might be affected by router restarts and false positives.
*   **Targeted Eepsite:** The attacker must have knowledge of the target eepsite they want to de-anonymize.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Versions Affected:**  I2P versions prior to 2.3.0 are vulnerable. The content specifically notes that 2.2.1 is vulnerable and older versions likely are.
*   **Fix:** The issue was fixed in I2P 2.3.0 by adding a unique identifier to every message ID and separating bloom filter contexts for client tunnels, exploratory tunnels, and direct messages to the router.
*   **i2pd not affected:** Users of i2pd are not affected by this vulnerability.
* **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS score is 3.4 (Overall) and 5.3 (Base). The exploitability subscore is 3.9 and impact subscore is 1.4
* The description also mentions additional hardening measures taken, including tweaks to the NetDB, rate-limiting mechanisms, and the behavior of floodfill routers to prevent similar future issues
