The provided content is related to CVE-2024-36054.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `Hw64.sys` driver of the Marvin Test HW.exe software. Specifically, the driver allows unprivileged user-mode processes to perform arbitrary kernel memory reads due to improper handling of IOCTL codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read:** The vulnerability allows unprivileged user-mode processes to read arbitrary kernel memory. This is achieved by sending specific IOCTL codes (0x9c4064b8) via the `MmMapIoSpace` API and (0x9c406490) via `ZwMapViewOfSection`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By reading kernel memory, attackers can potentially gain complete control over the system, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete system privileges, allowing them to perform any actions on the system.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Sensitive data in kernel memory can be accessed or manipulated.
*   **System Instability:** Malicious actions in kernel space can cause system instability or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **IOCTL Calls:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specific IOCTL codes to the vulnerable `Hw64.sys` driver. These IOCTLs are used to map kernel memory, but they are not properly restricted, leading to unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user-mode process, meaning it does not require administrator privileges initially.
