Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file upload validation in the `add-admin.php` file of the Prison Management System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system doesn't perform checks on the content and suffixes of files uploaded by users. This allows uploading files with malicious content, specifically PHP files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The absence of proper input sanitization on the uploaded files allows for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file containing code to be executed on the server, gaining control of the system and its resources.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The RCE vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload Functionality:** Attackers exploit the file upload mechanism available through the `add-admin.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the vulnerable file upload functionality** This typically would involve either having admin access or being able to bypass authentication.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file due to the lack of validation in the `add-admin.php` file, resulting in remote command execution and potentially full system compromise. The root cause is the absence of checks on file content and suffixes during the upload process, allowing the attacker to inject malicious code.
