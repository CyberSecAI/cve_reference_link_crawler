# Unsanitized user controlled input in module generation

High

[stephengroat-dd](/stephengroat-dd)
published
GHSA-5r27-rw8r-7967
Aug 7, 2023

## Package

npm

import-in-the-middle
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 1.4.1

## Patched versions

1.4.2

## Description

### Impact

The `import-in-the-middle` loader works by generating a wrapper module on the fly. The wrapper uses the module specifier to load the original module and add some wrapping code. It allows for remote code execution in cases where an application passes user-supplied input directly to an import() function.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in `import-in-the-middle` version 1.4.2

### Workarounds

* Do not pass any user-supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of allowed values.
* If using `import-in-the-middle` and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that none of the following options are set (either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable):

```
--loader=import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs
--loader import-in-the-middle/hook.mjs

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L

### CVE ID
