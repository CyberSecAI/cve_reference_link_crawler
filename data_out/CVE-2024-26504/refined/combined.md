# PoC - CVE-2024-26504

29 de abril de 2024

O WiFire Hotspot é uma solução de Wi-Fi voltada para empresas que oferece recursos para gerenciar redes, coletar dados de clientes e implementar estratégias de marketing.

Quando um usuário se conecta à rede Wi-Fi, é exibida uma janela pop-up que solicita o login. O login pode ser feito através de redes sociais ou por meio da criação de uma conta. Após o login, o cliente é redirecionado para a página da empresa proprietária da rede Wi-Fi.

No entanto, na versão v.4.5.3 do WiFire Hotspot, a página de redirecionamento é determinada pelo parâmetro “dst” na URL após o login. Isso significa que, se o valor desse parâmetro for modificado, o usuário será redirecionado para uma página diferente, dessa forma representando uma vulnerabilidade de Open Redirect.

Um atacante pode criar uma URL maliciosa com o parâmetro “dst” manipulado. Se conseguir convencer a vítima a clicar nessa URL, o invasor pode redirecioná-la para uma página não confiável, facilitando possíveis explorações. É importante destacar que tanto o atacante quanto a vítima devem estar conectados à mesma rede Wi-Fi local que utiliza o WiFire Hotspot para que a exploração seja possível.

O exemplo a seguir demonstra como o WiFire pode redirecionar para este site.

![wifire](/images/cve-2024-26504/wifire.png)

![redirect](/images/cve-2024-26504/redirect.png)

Esta foi a requisição feita ao acessar a página de login do Wifire.

## Description: Open redirection (reflected)

Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way. An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.

## Remediation: Open redirection (reflected)

If possible, applications should avoid incorporating user-controllable data into redirection targets. In many cases, this behavior can be avoided in two ways:

* Remove the redirection function from the application, and replace links to it with direct links to the relevant target URLs.
* Maintain a server-side list of all URLs that are permitted for redirection. Instead of passing the target URL as a parameter to the redirector, pass an index into this list.

If it is considered unavoidable for the redirection function to receive user-controllable input and incorporate this into the redirection target, one of the following measures should be used to minimize the risk of redirection attacks:

* The application should use relative URLs in all of its redirects, and the redirection function should strictly validate that the URL received is a relative URL.
* The application should use URLs relative to the web root for all of its redirects, and the redirection function should validate that the URL received starts with a slash character. It should then prepend http://yourdomainname.com to the URL before issuing the redirect.
* The application should use absolute URLs for all of its redirects, and the redirection function should verify that the user-supplied URL begins with http://yourdomainname.com/ before issuing the redirect.
