Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2023-30561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The data flowing between the BD Alaris™ PCU (Point-of-Care Unit) and its modules is transmitted insecurely. Specifically, the IUI (Inter-Unit Interface) bus lacks cryptographic security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of cryptographic protection for data transmitted on the IUI bus.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A threat actor with physical access could potentially read or modify data while an infusion is running. This could lead to:
  - **Confidentiality Breach**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted between the PCU and its modules.
  - **Integrity Violation**: Modification of data that could impact the functioning of the infusion process and the device's operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the BD Alaris™ PCU.
- Attachment of a specially crafted device to the IUI bus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access to the BD Alaris™ PCU.
- Technical expertise to create a device capable of interacting with the IUI bus and manipulating the data.
- No special privileges or user interaction required.

**Additional Details:**
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (Medium).
- The provided document states there is no impact on the availability of the system.
- BD has determined that the existing control measures effectively reduce the probability of harm and the residual risk is considered acceptable.
- A software update is not currently available and is planned for the future.
- The likelihood of a threat actor successfully applying a specially crafted device undetected at the bedside has been determined to be reasonably unforeseeable.
