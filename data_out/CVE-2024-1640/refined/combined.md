### Description

The Contact Form Builder Plugin: Multi Step Contact Form, Payment Form, Custom Contact Form Plugin by Bit Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a insufficient user validation on the bitforms\_update\_form\_entry AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify form submissions.
