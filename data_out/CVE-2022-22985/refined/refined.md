Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-22985:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization/filtering within the web application of the IPCOMM ipDIO device. Specifically, when handling parameters used for displaying historical data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):**  The web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code that is then executed when a legitimate user accesses the history review section.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information.
- **High Integrity Impact:**  The attacker can modify data or system configurations.
- **High Availability Impact:**  The attacker could disrupt the normal operations of the device or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network connection.
- **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required for an attacker to inject the malicious code.
- **User Interaction:**  The injected code executes when a legitimate user attempts to access and review the history section of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device.
- **No authentication required**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must rely on the victim to perform the specific action (reviewing history) which triggers the execution of injected code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The device is end-of-life (EOL), and no patches are available.
- The provided CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which translates to:
    - Attack Vector (AV): Network
    - Attack Complexity (AC): Low
    - Privileges Required (PR): None
    - User Interaction (UI): Required
    - Scope (S): Unchanged
    - Confidentiality Impact (C): High
    - Integrity Impact (I): High
    - Availability Impact (A): High
