# IPCOMM ipDIO

Last RevisedMarch 03, 2022
Alert CodeICSA-22-062-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 8.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low attack complexity
* **Vendor:** IPCOMM
* **Equipment:** ipDIO
* **Vulnerabilities:** Cross-site Scripting, Code Injection

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of IPCOMM ipDIO, a telecontrol communication device, are affected:

* Firmware Version 3.9 2016/04/18 / IPDIO SW 3.9

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in the web interface of ipDIO allows an authenticated remote attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting an XSS payload into specific fields. The XSS payload will be executed when a legitimate user attempts to upload, copy, download, or delete an existing configuration (Administrative Services).

[CVE-2022-24432](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24432) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF INPUT DURING WEB PAGE GENERATION ('CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING') CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

Persistent cross-site scripting in the web interface of ipDIO allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting an XSS payload into a specific parameter. The XSS payload will be executed when a legitimate user attempts to review history.

[CVE-2022-21146](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-21146) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

#### 3.2.3    [IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)

The absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the web section where the information is displayed. Injection can be done on specific parameters. The injected code is executed when a legitimate user attempts to upload, copy, download, or delete an existing configuration (Administrative Services).

[CVE-2022-24915](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-24915) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [IMPROPER CONTROL OF GENERATION OF CODE ('CODE INJECTION') CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)

The absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the specific web section where the information is displayed. Injection can be done on specific parameters. The injected code is executed when a legitimate user attempts to review history.

[CVE-2022-22985](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2022-22985) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Aarón Flecha Menéndez of S21Sec reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

IPCOMM no longer sells or maintains ipDIO and considers it an end-of-life product.

IPCOMM recommends upgrading to its ip4Cloud device, which is the successor to ipDIO. Contact [IPCOMM customer support](https://www.ipcomm.de/article/Contact/en/sheet.html) for assistance with the upgrade. For more information, visit the [IPCOMM ip4Cloud](https://www.ipcomm.de/product/ip4CloudSEC3IO/en/sheet.html) product page.

CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
