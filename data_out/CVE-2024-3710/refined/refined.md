- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which will execute when other users view the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious payload in the "Additional CSS class on A tag" field when creating or editing a gallery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a user with at least Contributor role to create or edit gallery with the malicious payload. The stored XSS vulnerability will impact higher privileged users such as admin when they view the affected page.
