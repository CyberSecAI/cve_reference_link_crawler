| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c0)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-20 13:49:18 UTC  ``` During a SUMA/UYUNI audit, a directory path traversal vulnerability has been found.   When viewing cobbler autoinstallation snippet, it is possible to evade from /var/lib/cobbler/snippet path using the "path" request parameter and accessing files outside the webserver root directory.  On a default installation, tomcat is running as a non-privileged user process, so the impact on the file system confidentiality is for files viewable by tomcat user, for groups www, susemanager and tomcat and for files viewable by anyone.  To exploit this vulnerability there is no need for a particular script but an authenticated SUMA session is needed. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c2)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-20 13:52:18 UTC  ``` CRD: 2022-11-03 15.00 UTC ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c5)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-20 14:00:36 UTC  ``` The vulnerability is in class com.redhat.rhn.frontend.action.kickstart.cobbler.CobblerSnipperViewAction reads “path” parameter from URL and then pass it to a File() class (line 51).  The parameter is used to load a com.redhat.rhn.domain.kickstart.cobbler.CobblerSnippet object.  As a suggested mitigation some regex control can be done to make sure no file is loaded outside /var/lib/cobbler/snippets ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c11)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-20 16:25:11 UTC  ``` After an internal brainstorm with Johannes, I re-calculated CVSS score assigning a value of 5  <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:H>  Since tomcat is running as low priv user process by default give us a pretty solid posture over critical system-wide files.  However consider that with this, a user can disclose constant and password at application level. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c17)  Paolo Perego   2022-10-21 11:29:32 UTC  ``` CRD: 2022-11-04 15.00 UTC ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c20)  Johannes Segitz   2022-10-24 15:12:14 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2022-31255 ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c25)  Paolo Perego   2022-11-04 16:13:01 UTC  ``` Fixed versions: SUMA 4.3.2, 4.2.10 and Uyuni-2022.10 ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1204543#c26)  Swamp Workflow Management   2022-11-04 17:30:09 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2022:3880-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
