- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored XSS vulnerability in the "dictionary name" field within the Dictionary section of Umbraco CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the Dictionary section. This can be leveraged to gain access to higher-privilege endpoints, potentially elevating user privileges (e.g., granting admin access to all users) or accessing protected content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker injects the malicious script via the "dictionary name" field in the Dictionary section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account that allows them to access the Dictionary section and have the ability to edit a dictionary entry or create a new one with a malicious "dictionary name". User interaction is required from another user with high-privileges to execute the payload.
