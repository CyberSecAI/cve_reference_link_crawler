| Itsourcecode "Online Blood Bank Management System" in PHP 1.0 "changepwd.php" SQL injectionNAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)  * Online Blood Bank Management System in PHP with Source Code  Vendor Homepage  * <https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-blood-bank-management-system-in-php-with-source-code/>  AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)submitter  * noobes  Vulnerable File  * changepwd.php  VERSION(S)  * V1.0  Software Link  * <https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blood-Bank-Management-System-in-Php-with-Source-Code-1.zip>  PROBLEM TYPEVulnerability Type  * SQL injection  Root Cause  * A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'changepwd.php' file of the 'Online Blood Bank Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "useremail" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.  Impact  * Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.  DESCRIPTION  * During the security review of the PHP Student Information Management System, noob discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "changepwd.PHP" file. This vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the "useremail" parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerabilityVulnerability details and POCVulnerability type:  * time-based blind  Vulnerability location:  * 'useremail' parameter  Payload: ```      tab=on&useremail=1@qq.com' AND (SELECT 2484 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))iuyF) AND 'CqHW'='CqHW&sub=Submit Email   ```  ```     Type: time-based blind     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)     Payload: tab=on&useremail=1@qq.com' AND (SELECT 2484 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))iuyF) AND 'CqHW'='CqHW&sub=Submit Email   ```  * [1](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/121587673/334628035-9d07aa9f-de77-48d2-8902-27da020c83a2.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1OTExNzAsIm5iZiI6MTczNjU5MDg3MCwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMjE1ODc2NzMvMzM0NjI4MDM1LTlkMDdhYTlmLWRlNzctNDhkMi04OTAyLTI3ZGEwMjBjODNhMi5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxMDIxMTBaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT00YmQ5N2JkODk3MDU2MjViNWI3YTFlNjQ2NjQxYjNjMWYzOTI4NTZmOGZkZDUwNTg2NzEwYjgyNGQwNmUxMzMxJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.yhPaOXojv3NK0YgbdkkoTKzTzSMtxzUXA8JSWBsAVSk)  The following are screenshots of some specific information obtained from testing and running with the sqlmap tool: +[2](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/121587673/334628057-55906442-25c3-4336-8834-7c5b87b067d9.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1OTExNzAsIm5iZiI6MTczNjU5MDg3MCwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMjE1ODc2NzMvMzM0NjI4MDU3LTU1OTA2NDQyLTI1YzMtNDMzNi04ODM0LTdjNWI4N2IwNjdkOS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExMVQxMDIxMTBaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT03NTM4MzdiZjcxMThlNjdmYzE0MWI3OWRhYzkxZmY0MWIxMTdkN2YxNTgzZmFiZTljMTE2NjNjYTg1NzIzMmRiJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.hBRmm32u37Gz5JgFaJcUwMTXIVcdT6t0S4kLodqUWKA) Suggested repair  1. **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**    Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code. 2. **Input validation and filtering:**    Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 3. **Minimize database user permissions:**    Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations. 4. **Regular security audits:**    Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |
