- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of IPv4 traffic in the egress MPLS packet processing function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the inadequate validation of IPv4 traffic when processing egress MPLS packets. Sending a malformed packet can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a malformed packet out of an affected MPLS-enabled interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to send the malformed packets to the affected interface.
