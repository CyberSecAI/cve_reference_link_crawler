Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the BGP daemon (bgpd) of FRRouting (FRR) when processing BGP UPDATE messages. Specifically, when a crafted BGP UPDATE message lacking mandatory attributes (such as one containing only an unknown transit attribute) is received, the code doesn't properly validate the length of the path attributes, leading to a crash. This issue is further exacerbated when graceful restart capability is negotiated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper check on the length of path attributes within a BGP UPDATE message when mandatory attributes are absent. It only checks if the `attr->flag` is set but does not validate the `length`, causing a crash.
- **Incorrect Handling of Graceful Restart:**  The vulnerability is conditional on the presence of the Graceful Restart capability. The logic to handle updates with missing mandatory attributes and graceful restart capability enabled is flawed.
- **Lack of Mandatory Attribute Enforcement:** The BGP implementation doesn't enforce the presence of all mandatory attributes which may be needed for proper processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the bgpd daemon. This can lead to a denial of service by disrupting BGP routing functionality.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Though not explicitly stated, a crash can sometimes open avenues for further exploitation. In this case it may be unlikely given it is triggered by a simple missing attribute length check.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted BGP UPDATE message to a vulnerable FRR router.
- **BGP Session:** The attack requires an established BGP session with a vulnerable FRR router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the target FRR router.
- **BGP Peering:**  The attacker needs to be a BGP peer of the vulnerable FRR router to send the malicious UPDATE message.
- **BGP Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the BGP protocol to craft the malicious UPDATE message with missing mandatory attributes and potentially with the graceful restart capability enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided commit (`d8482bf011cb2b173e85b65b4bf3d5061250cdb9`) addresses this vulnerability by adding a length check, validating that the attribute length is non-zero if the `attr->flag` isn't set under graceful restart.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability using a python script.
- The exploit uses a crafted update message with an unknown attribute type and an invalid length.
