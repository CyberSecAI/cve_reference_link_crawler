Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-6707:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation and sanitization of file names during the file upload process in Open WebUI. The application uses the filename provided in the HTTP upload request to construct the path for saving the file without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** The application fails to restrict the file path, allowing an attacker to use dot-segments (`../`) in the filename to traverse to arbitrary locations in the filesystem.
*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** The application allows users to upload files of any type to the server. The combination of path traversal and unrestricted file type upload makes the system vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can upload files to arbitrary locations on the web server's filesystem.
*   This could be used to upload malicious models (which can contain arbitrary Python bytecode), leading to arbitrary code execution upon deserialization.
*   It can also be used to upload an attacker's `authorized_keys` file, enabling remote access to the machine via SSH.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed via the `/rag/api/v1/doc` API endpoint.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request containing a file to be uploaded. The filename parameter in the multipart form data is manipulated to include path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Open WebUI server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/rag/api/v1/doc` endpoint with a valid bearer token.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server other than being able to upload files through the web interface.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerable code snippet is in python for the API route `/rag/api/v1/doc`
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.1.117 of Open WebUI.
