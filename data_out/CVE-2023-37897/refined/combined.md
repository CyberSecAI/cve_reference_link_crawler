# Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) mitigation bypass via incorrect filtering of double backslash

High

[rhukster](/rhukster)
published
GHSA-9436-3gmp-4f53
Jul 18, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=1.7.42.1

## Patched versions

1.7.42.2

## Description

### Summary

The fix for SSTI using `|map`, `|filter` and `|reduce` twigs implemented in the commit [71bbed1](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/71bbed12f950de8335006d7f91112263d8504f1b) introduces bypass of the denylist due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which allows to execute the payload prepending double backslash (`\\`)

### Details

The `isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and onwards retuns `false` value instead of `true` when the `\` symbol is found in the `$name`.

```
...
        if (strpos($name, "\\") !== false) {
            return false;
        }

        if (in_array($name, $commandExecutionFunctions)) {
            return true;
        }
...
```

Based on the code where the function is used, it is expected that any dangerous condition would return `true`

```
    /**
     * @param Environment $env
     * @param array $array
     * @param callable|string $arrow
     * @return array|CallbackFilterIterator
     * @throws RuntimeError
     */
    function mapFunc(Environment $env, $array, $arrow)
    {
        if (!$arrow instanceof \Closure && !is_string($arrow) || Utils::isDangerousFunction($arrow)) {
            throw new RuntimeError('Twig |map("' . $arrow . '") is not allowed.');
	}
```

when `|map('\system')` is used in the malicious payload, the single backslash is dropped prior to reaching `strpos($name, '\\')` check, thus `$name` variable already has no backslash, and the command is blacklisted because it reaches the `if (in_array($name, $commandExecutionFunctions)) {` validation step.

However if `|map('\\system')` is used (i.e. double backslash), then the `strpos($name, "\\") !== false` takes effect, and `isDangerousFunction()` returns `false` , in which case the `RuntimeError` is not generated, and blacklist is bypassed leading to code execution.

### Exploit Conditions

This vulnerability can be exploited if the attacker has access to:

1. an Administrator account, or
2. a non-administrator, user account that has Admin panel access and Create/Update page permissions

### Steps to reproduce

1. Log in to Grav Admin using an administrator account.
2. Navigate to `Accounts > Add`, and ensure that the following permissions are assigned when creating a new low-privileged user:
   * Login to Admin - Allowed
   * Page Update - Allowed
3. Log out of Grav Admin
4. Login using the account created in step 2.
5. Choose `Pages -> Home`
6. Click the `Advanced` tab and select the checkbox beside `Twig` to ensure that Twig processing is enabled for the modified webpage.
7. Under the `Content` tab, insert the following payload within the editor:

   `{{ ['id'] | map('\\system') | join() }}`
8. Click the `Preview` button. Observe that the output of the id shell command is returned in the preview.

### Mitigation

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
