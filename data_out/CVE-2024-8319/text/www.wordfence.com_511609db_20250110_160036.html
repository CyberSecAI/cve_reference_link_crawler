### Description

The Tourfic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.20. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the tf\_order\_status\_email\_resend\_function, tf\_visitor\_details\_edit\_function, tf\_checkinout\_details\_edit\_function, tf\_order\_status\_edit\_function, tf\_order\_bulk\_action\_edit\_function, tf\_remove\_room\_order\_ids, and tf\_delete\_old\_review\_fields functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to resend order status emails, update visitor/order details, edit check-in/out details, edit order status, perform bulk order status updates, remove room order IDs, and delete old review fields, respectively, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
