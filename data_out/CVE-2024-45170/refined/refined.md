Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper or missing access control in the C-MOR web interface. The application relies on the user interface for access restrictions instead of server-side checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** Low-privileged users can bypass UI restrictions and access administrative functions by directly sending HTTP requests to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Low-privileged users can perform actions intended for administrators.
*   Specifically, the provided PoC demonstrates downloading backup files.
*   The advisory mentions the potential for changing configuration settings as well.
*   This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers bypass the web UI by crafting and sending HTTP requests directly to the server. This allows them to access restricted functionalities.
*   **HTML Forms/Curl Commands:** Attackers can use HTML forms or command-line tools like `curl` to send the crafted requests, making it relatively easy to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a valid, albeit low-privileged, user account on the C-MOR system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the C-MOR web interface.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker should understand how to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides a specific example of downloading backup files using a POST request to `download-bkf.pml`.
