**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure temporary file creation within the `importAjax` action of the `crm.order.import.instagram.view` component in Bitrix24. Specifically, the `Instagram::saveImage` function uses `CFile::GetTempName` with an attacker-controlled filename, allowing the attacker to specify the name of the temporary file created. This, combined with the fact that the temporary files are created in the web server's accessible `/upload/tmp/` directory, allows for the upload of malicious `.htaccess` files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path:** The application uses an attacker-controlled filename when creating temporary files, allowing them to overwrite existing files or create new ones with arbitrary names.
*   **CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** The application allows the upload of arbitrary files, including `.htaccess` which can be used to configure the webserver.
*   Insecure temporary file creation leading to arbitrary file overwrite/creation
*   Lack of input sanitization on the filename derived from the URL
*   Bypass of the `streamTimeout` by periodically sending small chunks of data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote authenticated attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the web server. By uploading a malicious `.htaccess` file, the attacker can configure the web server to execute arbitrary code, leading to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `/bitrix/services/main/ajax.php?mode=class&c=bitrix%3Acrm.order.import.instagram.view&action=importAjax` with a crafted request containing the URLs to attacker controlled `.htaccess` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the Bitrix24 application.
*   The attacker needs to control a webserver where the malicious `.htaccess` file is hosted.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Bitrix24 server.
