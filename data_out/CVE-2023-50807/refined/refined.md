Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-50807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in the heap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is that a write operation is occurring beyond the allocated memory region in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is not explicitly detailed, but heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities can lead to:
    *   **Code Execution:** Attackers might be able to overwrite heap metadata, function pointers, or other critical data structures, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the targeted device.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption due to the out-of-bounds write can lead to application crashes and system instability.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the vulnerable code is running with elevated privileges, the attacker might be able to leverage the vulnerability to gain further access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication which implies the attack can be initiated by a remote attacker.
*   The vulnerability is in the 2G modem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need authentication.
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the 2G modem functionality of the affected devices.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   Exynos 9110
*   Exynos Modem 5123
*  Exynos Modem 5300

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported on 2023-10-31.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
*   The vulnerability was acknowledged by Dyon Goos & Marius Muench

**Summary:**
CVE-2023-50807 is a high-severity vulnerability caused by an out-of-bounds write in the heap within the 2G modem component of certain Samsung Exynos chipsets. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially achieve code execution, DoS or privilege escalation by sending malicious data to the vulnerable modem.
