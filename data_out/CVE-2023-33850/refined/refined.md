Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a "Timing Oracle in RSA Decryption" issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability exists within the GSKit component shipped with multiple IBM products, including IBM CICS TX Standard, IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms, and IBM CICS TX Advanced.
- It allows an attacker to potentially gain information about the decrypted data by analyzing the time it takes for the RSA decryption process to complete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure of the decrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the timing of RSA decryption operations.
- An attacker can observe the time taken for decryption and potentially deduce information about the decrypted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to observe the timing of RSA decryption operations. This implies the attacker has some level of network access or a similar position where they can measure the time it takes for these operations.

**Affected Products and Versions (Summary):**
- IBM CICS TX Standard 11.1 (Linux)
- IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms 8.1 (Linux, AIX), 8.2 (Linux, AIX, HP, Windows), 9.1 (Linux, AIX)
- IBM CICS TX Advanced 10.1, 11.1 (Linux)
