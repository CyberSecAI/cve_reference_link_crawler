The provided content is related to a commit in the GPAC project that fixes an issue described in issue #2255. The commit modifies the `src/isomedia/box_code_base.c` file, specifically addressing a memory allocation issue within the `xtra_box_read` function.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability was due to incorrect memory allocation size in `xtra_box_read` function when handling UTF16 strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The original code allocated `prop_size + 2` bytes for `data2`, intended to accommodate a potential UTF-16 string and a null terminator. However, this was not sufficient in all cases, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The updated code now allocates `prop_size + 3` bytes for `data2`. This change addresses the allocation issue. The extra byte is for null-aligning a potential short value when decoding a UTF-16 string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow** could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. While there's no specific mention of arbitrary code execution, such an overflow can have severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A crafted input file or stream containing a specially crafted `xtra` box with a specific `prop_size` could trigger the overflow when the `xtra_box_read` function is invoked to process the box's content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to an application utilizing the affected version of GPAC. No other explicit capabilities or access is specified.

**Additional Details:**

- The commit message indicates that this change fixes issue #2255, and the code changes clearly focus on adjusting the memory allocation size within the `xtra_box_read` function to handle UTF-16 strings properly. The code also adds an additional null terminator after the read data.
- The code diff shows that the allocation of `data2` was changed from `sizeof(char) * (prop_size+2)` to `sizeof(char) * (prop_size+3)`.
