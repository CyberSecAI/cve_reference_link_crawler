Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20537

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `WifiScanModeActivity` for guest users in the Android settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `WifiScanModeActivity` was accessible to guest users, even though it should not be. This suggests an access control issue where the activity's visibility and/or permissions were not properly restricted based on the user type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- This is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability. While the specific impact is not detailed, an attacker leveraging this vulnerability could potentially gain unauthorized access or manipulate settings, due to the guest user being able to access settings they should not.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A guest user on an Android device can directly access the `WifiScanModeActivity`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest user on the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the Android settings and access the `WifiScanModeActivity`, however the provided information does not detail the exact steps to achieve this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves restricting the `WifiScanModeActivity` so that it is not shown if the user is a guest user. This is done by checking the user type before allowing access to the activity.
- The commit message clearly states: "Restrict WifiScanModeActivity for guest user- Don't show WifiScanModeActivity if the user is a guest."
