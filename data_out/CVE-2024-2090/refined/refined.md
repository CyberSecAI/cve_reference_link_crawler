Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Remote Content Shortcode plugin for WordPress allows users to fetch content from remote URLs via the `remote_content` shortcode. The plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize the provided URLs, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin does not restrict the target URLs for the `remote_content` shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources from the server hosting the WordPress instance.
*   This can lead to querying internal services, accessing sensitive data, and potentially modifying internal resources depending on the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker with contributor-level access or higher can create or edit a post or page and insert the `remote_content` shortcode with a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker can be remote.
