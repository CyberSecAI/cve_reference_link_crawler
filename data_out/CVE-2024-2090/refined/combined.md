The Remote Content Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 via the remote\_content shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.

Plugin works great but I’m having one issue. The content I’m pulling is referencing CSS and JS with relative paths ../../ and throwing 404s since it can’t find in relation to where it’s being display. Any suggestions on how to handle that? thanks

This plugin works perfect for my needs. Awesome work! I use it to pull content from a “main article” into “related articles” in a Wikipedia fashion. It works flawlessly. Many thanks!
