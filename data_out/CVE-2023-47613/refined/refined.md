- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a relative path traversal issue within the Telit Cinterion modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The modules are susceptible to CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of intended virtual directories.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local, low-privileged attacker to escape virtual directories and gain read/write access to protected files on the targeted system. This can lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges on the target system. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
