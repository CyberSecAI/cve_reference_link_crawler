Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2543

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `get_uri_editor` function of the Permalink Manager Lite plugin for WordPress. Specifically, there's no capability check to ensure that a user is authorized to view the permalink of a specific post/page before displaying the URI editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a proper authorization check before displaying the URI editor via the `get_uri_editor` function. This allows unauthorized users to access and view permalink data.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows attackers to directly reference and access the permalinks of any post/page, regardless of whether they have the authorization to do so. This includes the permalinks of private posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the permalinks of any post/page, including those that are privately published by administrators. This exposes sensitive information about the website's content structure and potentially unpublished content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker, even without an account or with minimal privileges, can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Direct Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via an AJAX request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=pm_get_uri_editor` and a specific `post_id`.
*   **User Controlled `post_id`**: The `post_id` parameter is user controlled, allowing the attacker to iterate through different IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the WordPress website's URL
*   The attacker doesn't need a valid account or specific permissions. A low privileged user account like author or contributor can also exploit this.
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Permalink Manager Lite plugin versions up to and including 2.4.3.1.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.3.2.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using a crafted HTTP POST or GET request containing the `action` and a `post_id` parameters.
