Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-21490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `microblaze-dis.c` file within the GNU Binutils. Specifically, the `get_field` function and several related functions use `strdup` to copy strings but do not free the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The `strdup` function allocates memory which is not subsequently released, leading to memory accumulation over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition as the repeated memory leaks exhaust available resources. This is confirmed by the NetApp advisory.
- According to the bug report, the memory leak will consume memory on each instruction disassembled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a malicious input file that triggers the vulnerable code paths within the microblaze disassembler.
- The `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function is mentioned in the stack trace, indicating that a fuzzer was used to discover the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide input to a vulnerable application/tool that utilizes the affected GNU Binutils version.
- The attacker does not need special privileges, as the vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious input file.
- The provided NetApp advisory states the vulnerability is exploitable with a low attack complexity, requires no privileges, and user interaction is required. The attack vector is local.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report includes a stack trace and code snippet that pinpoint the location of the memory leak and provides technical details on the function involved in the memory leak.
- The vulnerability affects GNU Binutils version 2.34.
- The NetApp advisory confirms that multiple NetApp products incorporate GNU Binutils are affected by this vulnerability.
