Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-35637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the IBM Db2 database software. Specifically, it is triggered when a specially crafted, malformed SQL statement is entered into the `db2expln` tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `db2expln` tool does not properly handle malformed SQL statements.
- This leads to a vulnerability that can cause a denial of service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, rendering the affected Db2 instance unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `db2expln` tool. An attacker needs to submit a specially crafted malformed SQL query to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL statements using the `db2expln` tool.
- It is not specified if authentication is required, but typically such actions require some level of authorized access to the database system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Db2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows, specifically versions 10.5, 11.1, and 11.5. Versions 9.7 and 10.1 are not affected.
- IBM provides special builds or fix packs to address the vulnerability for affected versions.
- IBM does not disclose specific details of the malformed SQL statements to avoid providing attackers with specific exploit details.
- NetApp products incorporate IBM Db2 and are thus indirectly affected.
