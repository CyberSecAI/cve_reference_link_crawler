Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-47235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how FRRouting (FRR) handles malformed BGP UPDATE messages containing an End-of-RIB (EOR) marker.
- Specifically, the presence of an EOR in a malformed message is not correctly interpreted as a withdrawal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Handling of EOR:** When a BGP UPDATE message contains an EOR, it should be treated as a withdrawal. However, the code was not doing this.
- **Missing Mandatory Attributes Check**: If the EOR is not handled as a withdrawal, the update message could be processed as a normal UPDATE, and this may not contain mandatory attributes, which may be a malformed update.
- **Incorrect Processing:** The malformed update is processed incorrectly without the expected mandatory attributes leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the `bgpd` daemon.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated crashes could result in a denial of service for BGP routing functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed BGP UPDATE Message:** An attacker crafts a malformed BGP UPDATE message that includes an EOR.
- **Network Injection:** The attacker sends the crafted message to a vulnerable FRR router over a BGP connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the targeted FRR router to establish a BGP connection.
- **BGP knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of BGP protocol to send crafted packets.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The github content contains the commit message and code diff that addressed this issue, explaining the root cause: "Treat-as-withdraw, otherwise if we just ignore it, we will pass it to be processed as a normal UPDATE without mandatory attributes, that could lead to harmful behavior".
- The provided example configuration shows a potential scenario, as well as a python script to generate a test case for the malformed packet that will trigger the bug.
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that this CVE results in a crash and notes it affects FRR versions up to 9.0.1.
