| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c0)  Marco Benatto    2023-10-02 18:15:36 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds read issue exists in the verify_buffer_authenticode() function in shim.c. This issue is due to adding an offset to a pointer and then accessing the result without proper bounds checking. This bug is reachable by providing a malformed PE file to shim. This code runs before signature validation of the PE file.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c2)  Marco Benatto    2024-01-23 20:30:29 UTC  ``` Created shim tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2259923](show_bug.cgi?id=2259923 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-40549 shim: Out-of-bounds read in verify_buffer_authenticode() malformed PE file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c3)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-16 07:42:19 UTC  ``` shim 15.8-1.el7 passed sanity testing: signatures on efi binaries are correct, booting VM, netboot / httpboot over ipv4 and ipv6 all pass   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c4)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-16 07:54:34 UTC  ``` Important update information: The new shim revokes ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS of GRUB2. Therefore GRUB2 MUST be updated to the latest version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.14 (RHSA-2024:128440-02) BEFORE OR SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to continue to work. Failure to update GRUB2 will result in an UNBOOTABLE system.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 13:33:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:1834 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1834)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 13:41:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1835 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1835)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c7)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-17 10:11:01 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c17](show_bug.cgi?id=2234589#c17 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-40547 shim: RCE in http boot support may lead to Secure Boot bypass")   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:37:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Telecommunications Update Service  Via RHSA-2024:1873 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1873)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:43:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1876 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1876)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 01:51:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:1883 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1883)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 07:54:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:1903 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1903)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-18 07:57:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:1902 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1902)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-23 00:47:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2024:1959 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1959)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-29 02:16:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:2086 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2086)   ``` |  |
