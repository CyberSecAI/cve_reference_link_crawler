CVE ID         : CVE-2023-40546 CVE-2023-40547 CVE-2023-40548 CVE-2023-40549 CVE-2023-40550 CVE-2023-40551
Debian Bug     : 1046268 1069054

This release fixes various issues in shim bootloader and updates it to
a supported version. Older versions of the shim may eventually be blocked
by Secure Boot, so it is strongly advised for Secure Boot enabled systems
to upgrade to this newer version to keep the system bootable.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
15.8-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your shim packages.

For the detailed security status of shim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/shim>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c0)  Marco Benatto    2023-10-02 18:15:36 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds read issue exists in the verify_buffer_authenticode() function in shim.c. This issue is due to adding an offset to a pointer and then accessing the result without proper bounds checking. This bug is reachable by providing a malformed PE file to shim. This code runs before signature validation of the PE file.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c2)  Marco Benatto    2024-01-23 20:30:29 UTC  ``` Created shim tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2259923](show_bug.cgi?id=2259923 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2023-40549 shim: Out-of-bounds read in verify_buffer_authenticode() malformed PE file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c3)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-16 07:42:19 UTC  ``` shim 15.8-1.el7 passed sanity testing: signatures on efi binaries are correct, booting VM, netboot / httpboot over ipv4 and ipv6 all pass   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2241797#c4)  Marta Lewandowska    2024-04-16 07:54:34 UTC  ``` Important update information: The new shim revokes ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS of GRUB2. Therefore GRUB2 MUST be updated to the latest version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7_9.14 (RHSA-2024:128440-02) BEFORE OR SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to continue to work.

# RHSA-2024:1959 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: shim security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2024%3A1959)

## Topic

An update for shim is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The shim package contains a first-stage UEFI boot loader that handles chaining
to a trusted full boot loader under secure boot environments.

Security Fix(es):

* shim: RCE in http boot support may lead to Secure Boot bypass (CVE-2023-40547)
* shim: Interger overflow leads to heap buffer overflow in verify\_sbat\_section on 32-bits systems (CVE-2023-40548)
* shim: Out-of-bounds read printing error messages (CVE-2023-40546)
* shim: Out-of-bounds read in verify\_buffer\_authenticode() malformed PE file (CVE-2023-40549)
* shim: Out-of-bound read in verify\_buffer\_sbat() (CVE-2023-40550)
* shim: out of bounds read when parsing MZ binaries (CVE-2023-40551)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS
score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

IMPORTANT: The new shim revokes ALL VERSIONS of GRUB2 before grub2-2.02-0.87.el7\_9.14. Therefore GRUB2 MUST be updated to the latest
version: grub2-2.02-0.87.el7\_9.14 BEFORE or SIMULTANEOUSLY with this shim in order for Secure Boot to continue to work. Failure to update GRUB2 will result in an UNBOOTABLE system.
