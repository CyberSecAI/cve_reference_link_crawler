Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GetParentControlInfo` function of the Tenda FH1205 firmware version V2.0.0.7(775).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `mac` parameter within the `GetParentControlInfo` function. Insufficient bounds checking on this parameter allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This could grant the attacker complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `mac` parameter in the `GetParentControlInfo` function which is likely accessible through a network interface on the Tenda FH1205 router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device, likely on the local network.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send a crafted `mac` parameter with a payload larger than the allocated stack buffer size.
