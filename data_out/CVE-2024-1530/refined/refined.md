The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the ECShop 4.1.8 e-commerce platform.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This is exploited through the `view_sendlist.php` page in the admin panel. The application stores a base64 encoded SQL query in the cookie `ECSCP[lastfiltersql]` and a filter file value in `ECSCP[lastfilterfile]`. When `act=query&uselastfilter=1` is supplied, the application directly uses this base64 encoded SQL query from the cookie, without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- Insecure Cookie Handling: The application relies on a cookie value to construct its SQL query.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database manipulation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to read, modify, or delete database content.
- Privilege Escalation: The provided example shows adding a new administrator account to the database, leading to privilege escalation.
- Full Compromise: A successful exploit can result in complete control over the database and potentially the entire web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack is triggered by sending a GET request to `/admin/view_sendlist.php` with specific parameters and a crafted cookie.
- Cookie Manipulation: The attacker must set the `ECSCP[lastfiltersql]` and `ECSCP[lastfilterfile]` cookies to inject their malicious SQL code.
- Base64 encoding: The attacker needs to base64 encode the SQL injection query to store in the cookie value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the ECShop admin panel: The attacker needs access to the backend and has to be logged in as an administrator to visit `view_sendlist.php` and trigger the vulnerable functionality.
- Ability to capture and modify HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to capture and modify HTTP requests, specifically cookie values, to inject the malicious SQL code.
