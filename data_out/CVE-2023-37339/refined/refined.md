- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PCX files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious PCX file or visit a malicious page containing a malicious PCX file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the user interact with a malicious PCX file (either by opening it or visiting a web page with the malicious file).
