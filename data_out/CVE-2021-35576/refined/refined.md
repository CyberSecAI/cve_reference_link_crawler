1.  **Verification:** The content from `databasesecurityninja.wordpress.com` directly mentions CVE-2021-35576 and describes the vulnerability. The Oracle advisory also lists CVE-2021-35576 as a vulnerability related to "Oracle Database Enterprise Edition Unified Audit".

2.  **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that when an Oracle database is in upgrade mode, custom audit policies are not honored. The database only captures default audit policies like `ORA_SECURECONFIG` and `ORA_LOGON_FAILURES`, but not specific user-defined audit policies.

3.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the incomplete implementation of audit policy enforcement during database upgrade mode, leading to an audit bypass.

4.  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, such as a DBA or system admin, could perform actions against audited database objects (such as reading sensitive data) while the database is in upgrade mode. These actions would not be logged in the unified audit trail, therefore bypassing established security and logging mechanisms.

5.  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves setting the database into upgrade mode and then performing unauthorized actions which should otherwise be audited.

6.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would require the ability to set the database into upgrade mode, which typically requires SYSDBA or similar privileges.

7.  **Additional details:** The `databasesecurityninja.wordpress.com` content provides a practical example of how the vulnerability can be exploited:
    *   A table `HR.EMPLOYEE` is created.
    *   A custom audit policy `SELECT_P1` is configured to audit SELECT statements against `HR.EMPLOYEE`.
    *   The database is put in upgrade mode.
    *   A `SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEE` query is executed.
    *   After the database is brought out of upgrade mode and logs are checked, the `SELECT` statement execution is not recorded in the `unified_audit_trail` view.
    *   This confirms a complete bypass of the defined audit policy during upgrade mode.
