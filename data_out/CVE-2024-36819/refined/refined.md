Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36819:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filtering within the MapOS application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application was not properly sanitizing user inputs, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. This means that malicious scripts could be injected into the application's web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow attackers to:
    - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    - Steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied inputs, likely within GET, POST, or COOKIE data. This means any input field that is not properly sanitized could be used for the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into an input field of the application.
- No special privileges or network access are explicitly mentioned. The attacker just needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that allows for injection of the malicious script.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves enabling global XSS filtering via the configuration file. This was implemented by setting the `GLOBAL_XSS_FILTERING` variable to true in the `.env` file, and reading that value to set the `$config['global_xss_filtering']` in the `config.php` file. This will activate the application's XSS protection mechanism by sanitizing input data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message indicates that the fix addresses both CVE-2024-35545 and CVE-2024-36819.
- The code changes show that the `global_xss_filtering` setting in the configuration file was updated to be controlled via an environment variable, and that the default value is now true.
- The commit message provided by the author explicitly mentions that the commit fixes the reported CVEs.
