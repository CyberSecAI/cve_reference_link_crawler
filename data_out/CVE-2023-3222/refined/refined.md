**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the password recovery mechanism of the Roundcube Password Recovery Plugin. Specifically, it allows an attacker to change an existing user's password by adding a 6-digit numeric token, with no limit on the number of requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of rate limiting or brute-force protection on the password recovery process.
- Insecure password reset mechanism relying on a 6-digit numeric token.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to change an existing user's password, potentially leading to account takeover and unauthorized access to the user's email account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote (network-based).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.
- They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable password recovery endpoint.
- The attacker would need to be able to make requests without any limit, which would allow them to try all numeric token combinations to perform a password change.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.2 of the Roundcube Password Recovery Plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-640 (Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password).
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.5, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
