- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Blocksy Companion plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing the crafted malicious request.
