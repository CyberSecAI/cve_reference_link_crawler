## [CVE-2023-30297 Release Note](https://status.n-able.com/2023/07/27/cve-2023-30297-release-note/)

Posted on [July 27, 2023](https://status.n-able.com/2023/07/27/cve-2023-30297-release-note/ "3:00 am") by [Matt Miller](https://status.n-able.com/author/mattmillernablecom/ "View all posts by Matt Miller")

The following vulnerability was addressed in N-central 2023.4 (released on June 22, 2023):

[CVE-2023-30297](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-30297) could allow for the N-central agent to be vulnerable to a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack due to the certificate errors not being recognized by the N-central agent when connecting to the N-central server.

To get information on upgrading, please see these links:

* N-central 2023.4: <https://status.n-able.com/2023/06/22/announcing-the-ga-of-n-central-2023-4/>
* N-central 2022.7 HF 1: <https://status.n-able.com/2023/07/25/announcing-the-ga-of-n-central-2022-7-hf1/>

The N-central agent may be vulnerable to a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack due to the certificate errors not being recognized by the N-central agent when connecting to the N-central server.

The CVSS, as scored by the N-able Security Team, is 8.1(High). N-able is recommending all N-central customers update the N-central server and all N-central agents to 2023.4.

We want to thank Comitor for their assistance in reporting the issue in a responsible manner and helping N-able test the fix for this issue.
