# double-free in dialog\_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648

Moderate

[chrisbra](/chrisbra)
published
GHSA-46pw-v7qw-xc2f
Aug 1, 2024

## Package

vim

## Affected versions

< v9.1.0648

## Patched versions

v9.1.0648

## Description

# double-free in dialog\_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648

**Date:** 01.08.2024

**Severity:** Low

**CVE:** CVE-2024-41965

**CWE:** Double Free (CWE-416)

### Summary

double-free in dialog\_changed() in Vim < v9.1.0648

## Impact

When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the

modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim

may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet.

However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free

a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a

heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash.

The Vim project would like to thank github user SuyueGuo for reporting this issue.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648

### PoC

1. compile vim with ASAN

```
CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -g" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-gui=none

export ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1:detect_leaks=1:malloc_context_size=25:symbolize=1:log_path=./asan.log

make

```

2. exec with following command

```
/home/vim-debug/src/vim -u NONE -X -Z -e -s -S heap_uaf -c ':qa!'

```

following is the heap\_uaf tar file, please extract heap\_uaf from the tar file:

[heap\_uaf.tar.gz](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16451253/heap_uaf.tar.gz)

```
tar -xzvf heap_uaf.tar.gz

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Problem:  [security] double-free in dialog_changed()
          (SuyueGuo)
Solution: Only clear pointer b_sfname pointer, if it is different
          than the b_ffname pointer.  Don't try to free b_fname,
          set it to NULL instead.
