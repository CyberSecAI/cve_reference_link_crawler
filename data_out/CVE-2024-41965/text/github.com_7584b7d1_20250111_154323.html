Problem:  [security] double-free in dialog_changed()
          (SuyueGuo)
Solution: Only clear pointer b_sfname pointer, if it is different
          than the b_ffname pointer.  Don't try to free b_fname,
          set it to NULL instead.

Copy link    Quote reply     @zeertzjq **[zeertzjq](/zeertzjq)** [Aug 1, 2024](#r144920264) Member   This condition seems always true:   * `buf_set_name()` calls `fname_expand()`. * `fname_expand()` assigns `*sfname = *ffname` and `*ffname = fix_fname(*ffname)`. * `fix_fname()` returns either a newly-allocated string or `NULL`, so `*sfname` and `*ffname` must be different now.   Even if this condition is ever false, there should be a `buf->b_sfname = NULL` on the `else` branch.      All reactions          This comment has been minimized.
