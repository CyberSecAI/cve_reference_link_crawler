This plugin has been NOTHING but trouble. The functionality is awesome but breaks all the time. They are good about helping you find a solution – but you simply shouldn’t NEED help as often as I have. Maybe it’s my unique set up… I don’t know, but I would advise looking for this functionality elsewhere or do a shit-ton of testing.

This is the best customer service experience I have ever received from a plug in. The responses are quick, efficient, and effective. I’ve never once contacted a rep and felt my issue was left unresolved. The representatives go above and beyond to make sure customers are satisfied with both the product and their communication. I’ll never use another plug-in.
