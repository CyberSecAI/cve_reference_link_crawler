- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect classification of certain Ethernet frames as traffic class 7 virtual output queue (TC7 VOQ) when received on a Layer 2 interface.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Incorrect traffic classification leading to the exhaustion of the TC7 VOQ.
    - Lack of proper handling for specific types of Ethernet frames.
- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) condition by causing critical control plane packets (e.g., keepalives, hello packets) to be dropped.
    - Failure of control plane protocol relationships (e.g., OSPF, ISIS, BFD, BGP, LDP).
- **Attack Vectors:** An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can send specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable device.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted Ethernet frames.
