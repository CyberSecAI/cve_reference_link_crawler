This vulnerability is due to incorrect classification of certain types of Ethernet frames that are received on an interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-l2services-2mvHdNuC>  This advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco NCS devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and if they are configured with Layer 2 Ethernet services:    + NCS 55A1 Fixed Chassis   + NCS 55A2 Fixed Chassis   + NCS 540 Series Routers (except N540-24Q8L2DD-SYS)   + NCS 560 Series Routers   + NCS 5500 Series Modular Chassis1   + NCS 5501 Fixed Chassis   + NCS 5502 Fixed Chassis 1. All product IDs except those starting with NCS57 are affected by this vulnerability. For more information, see the [Cisco Network Convergence System 5500 Series Modular Chassis](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/network-convergence-system-5500-series/datasheet-c78-736270.html) data sheet.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine Whether the Device is Configured with Layer 2 Ethernet Services**  To determine whether Layer 2 services are configured on the device, use the command **show running-config | include l2transport**. If output is returned, the device is affected, as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501#show running-config | include l2transportTue Jan 16 01:14:07.977 UTCBuilding configuration...interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1.200 l2transportRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501#   ```  If the output returns no information, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Platforms that are not listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory   + NX-OS Software  Details  * When specific frames are received on the Layer 2 interface, they are incorrectly classified as traffic class 7 virtual output queue (TC7 VOQ). If enough of these frames are sent at sustained rates, the VOQ will start to drop packets in TC7. The affected port is the interface by which the Layer 2 traffic receives egresses from the device. In most cases, this is the core interface of a service provider.  Because control plane traffic is also handled within this queue, this vulnerability could cause keepalive or hello packets to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition for protocols such as OSPF, Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (ISIS), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  To monitor the state of the VOQs, use the **show controllers npu stats voq ingress interface** command. The following example shows command output of a TC\_7 VOQ that is being exhausted:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5501#show controllers npu stats voq ingress interface tenGigE 0/0/0/2 instance 0 location 0/0/CPU0Wed Mar 13 16:00:00.000 UTCInterface Name    =    Te0/0/0/2Interface Handle  =          118Location          =     0/0/CPU0Asic Instance     =            0VOQ Base          =         1088Port Speed(kbps)  =     10000000Local Port        =        local       ReceivedPkts    ReceivedBytes   DroppedPkts     DroppedBytes-------------------------------------------------------------------Core-0:TC_0 = 0               0               0               0TC_1 = 47708616        37410160369     0               0TC_2 = 0               0               0               0TC_3 = 0               0               0               0TC_4 = 0               0               0               0TC_5 = 0               0               0               0TC_6 = 0               0               0               0TC_7 = 11033161168     1108832775990   6905125762      791656829609Core-1:TC_0 = 0               0               0               0TC_1 = 0               0               0               0TC_2 = 0               0               0               0RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-5501#   ```  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
