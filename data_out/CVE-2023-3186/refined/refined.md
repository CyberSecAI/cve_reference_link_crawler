- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype pollution, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary properties into `Object.prototype`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or further exploitation depending on how the injected properties are later used by the application.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with a specially crafted query string `__proto__[poc]=polluted` when a popup is set to load on any page, an attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to a vulnerable WordPress site with a specially crafted query string when the vulnerable popup is active on the page.
