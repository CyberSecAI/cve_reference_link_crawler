- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication due to a specific credential string that bypasses the intended authentication scheme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Authentication (CWE-287). The device's web interface can be accessed and administrative operations can be performed by using a specific credential string, bypassing normal authentication procedures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with network access can bypass authentication and perform administrative operations on the affected device. This could lead to unauthorized control, modification of settings, and disruption of operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the device's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and knowledge of the specific credential string used to bypass authentication. The attack complexity is low.
