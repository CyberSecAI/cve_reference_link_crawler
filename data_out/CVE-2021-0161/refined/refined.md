- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The firmware lacks proper validation of input, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security breaches.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A privileged user can potentially escalate their privileges, leading to complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have existing high-level privileges on the target system.
