Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1461

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the 'style' attribute of the Team Members widget does not properly handle user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to sanitize or escape user input when rendering the 'style' attribute of the Team Members widget, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages.
- **Potential for Data Theft, Session Hijacking, or Defacement:** The injected scripts could be used to perform various malicious actions such as stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Widget Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the Team Members widget within the Elementor page builder.
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the 'style' attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they must have an account on the site and be able to create and edit content.
- **Ability to Use Elementor:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit pages using the Elementor page builder, where the vulnerable widget is available.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 8.3.4 of the Elementor Addons by Livemesh plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 8.3.6.
