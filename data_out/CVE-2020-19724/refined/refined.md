The provided content relates to a memory leak vulnerability, but it is for Bug 25362, not CVE-2020-19724.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- A memory leak occurs in the `nm` utility, specifically in the `display_rel_file` function, due to not freeing allocated memory for `dyn_syms`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Memory leak in `bfd_malloc` when handling synthetic symbols

Impact of exploitation:
- Uncontrolled memory consumption, potentially leading to denial of service if the utility is run repeatedly or with large inputs

Attack vectors:
- By running the `nm` utility with specific arguments (`-C -a -l --synthetic`) on a specially crafted object file ("poc"). The provided "poc file" attachment serves as the trigger

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `nm` utility with specific options, which suggests a local or command-line access.

Additional details:
- The bug was found in `binutils` version 2.32.
- The fix involves freeing the `dyn_syms` allocated memory in the `display_rel_file` function.
- Multiple instances of leaks were detected by AddressSanitizer:
    - A large leak of 4294967344 bytes via `bfd_malloc`
    - A 64-byte leak via `xmalloc`
    - A 112-byte leak via `bfd_malloc`.
