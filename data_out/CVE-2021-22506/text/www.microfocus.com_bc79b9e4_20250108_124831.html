## 1.0 Access Manager 5.0 Overview

Access Manager 5.0 includes significant improvements in deployment, administration, and automation of the product. This release introduces several features for easing installation, upgrade, and monitoring processes. These features help customers in reducing the total cost of ownership of the product. This release also addresses many long-pending operational challenges.

The product now has a modernized distribution with Docker images and is optimized to run on the Kubernetes platform. As a result, the installation and upgrades are significantly fast. The in-built scaling functionality of the Kubernetes helps with optimizing the cost of running the servers.

Channel-based software distribution is also enhanced. The existing deployments will now get notifications whenever an update to the product is available.

This release also addresses several concerns on handling customization. Using an Advanced File Configurator, you can centrally manage all configuration files. The tool will take care of customized files in future upgrades automatically.

Enhanced Analytics Dashboard offers modernized and customizable graphs, a smaller footprint, and an easier way to manage upgrades. It is delivered as a service, which makes it available for cloud deployments as well.

In addition to these, this release includes many enhancements around OAuth and OIDC. This provides better application interoperability, flexibility, and improved security.

### 2.1 Support for Docker Deployment

Access Manager now supports Docker for deploying the containers. Access Manager components are delivered as Docker images and are self-sufficient to run on their own.

Access Manager Docker images are optimized to run on Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration engine for Docker. Kubernetes simplifies deploying, running, scaling, and upgrading Access Manager Docker images. Access Manager Docker images are cloud-native applications and can run in Kubernetes environments deployed on Linux servers and cloud.

The following are some of the noteworthy advantages while deploying the Docker images in Kubernetes:

* Significantly reduced installation and upgrade time, thereby reducing the maintenance cost.
* Decreased downtime and reduced manual intervention for upkeep. Kubernetes constantly monitors the health of the Access Manager pods. If a pod stops working, Kubernetes automatically starts a new one.
* Kubernetes offers a built-in fault-tolerant environment and therefore has no service interruption. This Kubernetes has built-in isolation mechanisms, such as namespaces. It allows you to group container resources using access permissions, thereby enhancing security.
* Orchestrate and manage all container resources from a single control plane. This helps optimize the networking, load-balancing, security, and scaling across all Kubernetes nodes.
* Access Manager components can be easily scaled up to meet high demands.
* Support for deploying in cloud environments; Amazon EKS and Microsoft Azure AKS.

For more information, see [Installing Access Manager Containers](../install_upgrade/hj567dgaj1.html#hj567dgaj1) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Installation and Upgrade Guide](../install_upgrade/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

*NOTE:*Access Manager Docker images are supported only on a Kubernetes environment.

### 2.2 Online Update Service and Upgrade Assistant

Online Update Service enables you to get the latest Access Manager product updates through the service channel. The Upgrade Assistant feature simplifies the usage of Online Service Update. Using this feature, you can perform the following actions on Administration Console:

* Register to Online Service Update for all devices
* View notifications on Administration Console Dashboard when a release update is available
* View the list of all devices, their versions, and registration status
* View available updates and status of devices
* Invoke the channel registration for an individual device

For more information, see [Upgrade Assistant](../install_upgrade/upgrade-assistant.html#upgrade-assistant) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Installation and Upgrade Guide](../install_upgrade/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 2.3 Advanced File Configurator

Access Manager supports many advanced configurations through files, such as server.xml and tomcat.conf. Using these files, you can perform various customizations for your Access Manager setup. Access Manager also supports customization and extensions of the product through JSP files and authentication classes. In the earlier releases, customers managed these custom files manually during an upgrade. Besides, system configuration files, such as server.xml and tomcat.conf, were overwritten with the default values during the upgrade. Access Manager introduces Advanced File Configurator to address these challenges.

Advanced File Configurator helps with the centralized management of configuration files. Using this feature, you can retrieve a configuration file from a specific device, customize it, upload it, and apply the changes to all clusters or a specific cluster.

Advanced File Configurator provides the following features:

* Manage Configuration: Manages all configuration files for Administration Consoles, Identity Server, Access Gateway, and ESP.

  + Provides the capability to add, fetch, upload, compare, merge, send to all, and remove configurations. You can also compare files and folders.
  + Provides an option to fetch multiple files from a cluster, modify them, and add them as configuration files in Administration Console.
  + Provides an option to download a specific file or all files related to a device.
  + Provides an option to send configuration changes to all devices together.
  + Maintains a list of all configuration files with the customization details.
* Export and Import Configuration: Provides options to export and import the Access Manager configuration across different clusters of the same or different Access Manager setups. The setups must have the same version of Access Manager.
* Auto-apply Configuration to a New Node: When a new instance is added to a cluster, all configurations are automatically applied to that instance. No need to manually apply or revert any change to each device.
* Persist Configuration Across Releases: Eases restoring customizations after the product upgrade.

For more information, see [Advanced File Configurator](../admin/advanced-file-configurator.html#advanced-file-configurator) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 2.4 Enhanced Analytics Dashboard

This release introduces a significantly enhanced Analytics Dashboard built on top of the latest Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) components. The Dashboard offers significant advantages over the previous versions, including a smaller footprint, better manageability, ease of upgrade, and maintenance.

The following are some of the significant updates included in this release:

* Significantly reduced hardware requirements:

  | For the Demonstration Purpose | For a Production Environment |
  | + CPU: 2 Cores + Memory: 4 GB + Hard disk: 50 GB | + CPU: 4 Cores + Memory: 16 GB + Depends on the Access Manager login pattern for a day. For more information, see [Sizing Guidelines](../performance-and-sizing-guidelines/sizing-guidelines.html#sizing-guidelines). |
* Built on top of the latest ELK stack and uses most of the Kibana functions including search, visualizations, custom graphs, and more.
* Built-in geo-location identification.
* To create a custom dashboard using the existing data.
* Customized view of the graphs.
* Significant performance improvement. Supports 600 logins/sec.
* Enhanced security with updated libraries.
* Flexibility to install on SLES and RHEL.
* Clustering for high availability.
* Eliminates dependency on Sentinel for the storage and processing of events.

  *NOTE:*Access Manager still supports sending the Audit events to Sentinel, which works as an independent SIEM system.

For more information, see [Analytics Dashboard](../admin/b1kyp92l.html#b1kyp92l) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

*IMPORTANT:*Before installing the new Analytics Dashboard, ensure to delete Analytics Server nodes of the earlier version from Administration Console.

The latest version is independent of the SIEM server and uses logstash that acts as the aggregator and replaces the Analytic Server aggregator. The events are processed by ELK. Therefore, reports and offline Analytics Dashboard are not supported, and the existing events cannot be migrated.

However, you can use the new Analytics Dashboard along with the earlier Sentinel-based Analytics Dashboard to capture events in both until all the data become available in the new dashboard. To achieve this, you must configure two target servers, one for the old and one for the new Analytics Dashboard. For more information, see [Setting Up Logging Server and Console Events](../admin/b63kqzr.html#b63kqzr).

However, you cannot launch the old Analytics Dashboard from Administration Console. Instead, you can access the old data using the following direct access link:

* *Dashboard:*
  https://<Analytics IP>:8445/amdashboard/login

### 2.5 OAuth Enhancements

Access Manager provides the following enhancements to the OAuth support for better application interoperability, flexibility, and improved security:

* *Default Resource Server Configuration:*
  You can choose a resource server to make it the default resource server. All the new tokens are then issued and encrypted by the default resource server keys.
* *Support to Choose the Resource Server for Token Encryption:*
  While configuring an Access Gateway Identity Injection policy, you can choose the resource server for encrypting tokens.
* *OIDC Front-Channel Logout Support:*
  This feature supports the following two forms of logout request:

  + Identity Provider initiated logout request: Allows a user to log out from all client applications when the user logs out from Identity Server.
  + Relying Party (client application) initiated logout request: When a user initiates logout from one client application, the user can authorize to log out from Identify Server and other logged-in applications.

  *NOTE:*The OIDC specification does not mandate that the OIDC endpoints must start with the issuer URL. Therefore, the OAuth client applications that use the angular-oauth2-oidc third-party OAuth library might not be functional and display errors after upgrading to Access Manager 5.0. For more information and to rectify the issue, see [OAuth Client Application Returns an Error Message](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/access-manager/5.0/admin/b1cgrlhj.html#angular-oauth2-oidc-error).
* *Support for Multi-Factor Authentication (Resource Owner Credential Grant):*
  You can now invoke multi-factor authentication for the resource owner credential flow. It supports Smartphone and Voice Call methods.
* *Support to Disable OAuth Client Application:*
  Access Manager now supports disabling OAuth client applications. Deleting and re-creating a client application can be a hassle, and it also removes the Client ID and Secret. Hence, if you do not need to use a client application temporarily, you can disable it.
* *Performance Improvement of the Client Applications Page:*
  The Client Applications page is enhanced to:

  + Load thousands of registered client applications instantaneously.
  + Support faster registration and management of client applications.

For more information, see [OAuth and OpenID Connect](../admin/b1dj6b2f.html#b1dj6b2f) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 2.6 Access Manager License
