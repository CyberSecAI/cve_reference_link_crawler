In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Error out instead on BUG_ON() in IBI DMA setup

Definitely condition dma_get_cache_alignment * defined value > 256
during driver initialization is not reason to BUG_ON(). Turn that to
graceful error out with -EINVAL.
