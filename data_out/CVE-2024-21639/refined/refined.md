The content is related to CVE-2024-21639.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing size check in `CefLayeredWindowUpdaterOSR::OnAllocatedSharedMemory`. This function receives a shared memory region and the window size from the GPU process. It calculates the expected buffer size using `viz::ResourceSizes::MaybeSizeInBytes`, but it fails to verify if the actual size of the shared memory region is at least as large as the calculated expected size before mapping it, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to inadequate size check.
- The `CefLayeredWindowUpdaterOSR::OnAllocatedSharedMemory` function maps the shared memory without validating its size against the expected size.
- The subsequent `CefLayeredWindowUpdaterOSR::Draw` and `view_->OnPaint` functions read from the shared memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker controlling the GPU process can send a shared memory region smaller than expected which can cause an out-of-bounds read when the mapped shared memory is accessed. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially other memory corruption issues.
- The vulnerability is exploitable outside the sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- A compromised GPU process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the GPU process and send a malicious shared memory region.
