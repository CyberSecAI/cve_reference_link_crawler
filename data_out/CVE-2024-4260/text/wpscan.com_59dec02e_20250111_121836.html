## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CoBlocks < 3.1.12 - Contributor+ SSRF

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users from pinging arbitrary hosts via some of its shortcodes, which could allow high privilege users such as contributors to perform SSRF attacks.

### Proof of Concept

You should create a new block and add here "Events" block. Put inside http://127.0.0.1:XXXX/. If an error appears after clicking the "Use URL" button, it means that the port is closed, and if there is an empty screen, then the port is open
