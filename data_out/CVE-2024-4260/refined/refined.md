- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CoBlocks plugin allows users to specify URLs in certain shortcodes (specifically within the Events block). The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize these URLs, enabling high-privilege users to make the server perform requests to arbitrary hosts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to lack of sanitization/validation of user-supplied URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with contributor or higher privileges can use SSRF to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially perform other attacks, depending on the network configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL within the Events block and triggering the block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least "Contributor" level privileges on the WordPress site to create and use the vulnerable shortcode.
