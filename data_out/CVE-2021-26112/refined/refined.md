- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in both network daemons and the command line interpreter of FortiWAN.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflows [CWE-121].
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can potentially corrupt control data in memory and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Specifically crafted requests to network daemons or the command line interpreter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can send malicious requests.
