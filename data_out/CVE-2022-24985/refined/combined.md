|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | > [Suggested description] |
|  | > Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 (if file-upload |
|  | > capability is enabled) allow remote unauthenticated attackers to |
|  | > upload executable files and achieve remote code execution. This occurs |
|  | > because file-extension checks occur on the client side, and because |
|  | > not all executable content (e.g., .phtml or .php.bak) is blocked. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > The reason for this vulnerability is that file extension checking on |
|  | > the upload occurs client-side, and is thus easily bypassed by |
|  | > intercepting the POST request and tampering with the uploaded file. |
|  | > Server-side, forms generated prior to June 2019 (at least) will append |
|  | > a .bak extension to some filetypes often interpreted as PHP code by |
|  | > web servers (e.g. .php). However, there are two problems with this |
|  | > approach: (1) if .bak files are not blacklisted from executing PHP |
|  | > code, appending a .bak extension does not prevent PHP code from being |
|  | > executed. We have observed this behavior in the wild. Also, users of |
|  | > the form software are not notified that they must blacklist .bak |
|  | > extensions in order to use the forms safely. (2) not all filetypes |
|  | > known to execute valid PHP code have .bak appended. .phtml files, for |
|  | > instance, do not have .bak appended. |
|  | > |
|  | > Forms generated between sometime after June 2019 (we're not sure when) |
|  | > and Feb. 5, 2022 append .bak extensions to all file uploads, |
|  | > regardless of extension. This still faces problem (1), where web |
|  | > servers that do not blacklist .bak files may interpret those files as |
|  | > valid PHP (or other code), enabling unauthenticated RCE. |
|  | > |
|  | > In order to fully exploit this RCE vulnerability, it must be chained |
|  | > together with the path disclosure vulnerability for forms with file |
|  | > upload capability. That vulnerability is also disclosed in this |
|  | > submission. |

The Account section was closed on Aug, 2003. See details here.

We're sorry that we have made the difficult decision to close the Account section of our platform. This decision was driven by two primary factors: data concerns and the operational costs associated with maintaining the service.

We kindly request that you [login your Account section](/user/) and backup all of your forms. Read [here on how to edit your form](/help/admin-panel-edit-form.php) in the future.

Although the Account section will no longer be available, we want to assure you that all other form building features remain unaffected. You can still use the JQuery Form Builder to generate and download forms as usual. Happy form building!

We apologize for any inconvenience this decision may cause and appreciate your understanding.
