|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | > [Suggested description] |
|  | > Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 (if file-upload |
|  | > capability is enabled) allow remote unauthenticated attackers to |
|  | > upload executable files and achieve remote code execution. This occurs |
|  | > because file-extension checks occur on the client side, and because |
|  | > not all executable content (e.g., .phtml or .php.bak) is blocked. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [Additional Information] |
|  | > The reason for this vulnerability is that file extension checking on |
|  | > the upload occurs client-side, and is thus easily bypassed by |
|  | > intercepting the POST request and tampering with the uploaded file. |
|  | > Server-side, forms generated prior to June 2019 (at least) will append |
|  | > a .bak extension to some filetypes often interpreted as PHP code by |
|  | > web servers (e.g. .php). However, there are two problems with this |
|  | > approach: (1) if .bak files are not blacklisted from executing PHP |
|  | > code, appending a .bak extension does not prevent PHP code from being |
|  | > executed. We have observed this behavior in the wild. Also, users of |
|  | > the form software are not notified that they must blacklist .bak |
|  | > extensions in order to use the forms safely. (2) not all filetypes |
|  | > known to execute valid PHP code have .bak appended. .phtml files, for |
|  | > instance, do not have .bak appended. |
|  | > |
|  | > Forms generated between sometime after June 2019 (we're not sure when) |
|  | > and Feb. 5, 2022 append .bak extensions to all file uploads, |
|  | > regardless of extension. This still faces problem (1), where web |
|  | > servers that do not blacklist .bak files may interpret those files as |
|  | > valid PHP (or other code), enabling unauthenticated RCE. |
|  | > |
|  | > In order to fully exploit this RCE vulnerability, it must be chained |
|  | > together with the path disclosure vulnerability for forms with file |
|  | > upload capability. That vulnerability is also disclosed in this |
|  | > submission. |
