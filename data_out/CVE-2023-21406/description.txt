Ariel Harush and Roy Hodir from OTORIO have found a flaw in the AXIS A1001 when
communicating over OSDP. A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the pacsiod process which
is handling the OSDP communication allowing to write outside of the allocated buffer. By
appending invalid data to an OSDP message it was possible to write data beyond the heap
allocated buffer. The data written outside the buffer could be used to execute arbitrary code.Â
