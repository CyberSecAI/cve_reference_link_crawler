•  AXIS A1001

1.65.4 or earlier

Summary

Ariel Harush and Roy Hodir from OTORIO have found a flaw in the AXIS A1001 when
communicating over OSDP. A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the pacsiod process which
is handling the OSDP communication allowing to write outside of the allocated buffer. By
appending invalid data to an OSDP message it was possible to write data beyond the heap
allocated buffer. The data written outside the buffer could be used to execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability has been assigned a 7.1 (High) severity by using the CVSSv3.1 scoring system.

Solution & Mitigation

message parser and patches the highlighted flaw.

The release notes will state the following:
Corrected CVE-2023-21406. For more information, please visit the Axis vulnerability management portal.

It is recommended to update the Axis device software.
