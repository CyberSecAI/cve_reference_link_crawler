- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the `pacsiod` process when handling OSDP communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of OSDP messages. Specifically, appending invalid data to an OSDP message allows writing beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution by writing data outside the intended buffer.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted OSDP messages with appended invalid data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable device over OSDP.
