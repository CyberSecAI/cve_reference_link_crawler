- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security issue in the `ngx_http_mp4_module` of nginx.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a worker process crash via a specially crafted MP4 file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in a crash of the nginx worker process, leading to potential denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file with the `ngx_http_mp4_module`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to trigger the processing of the crafted MP4 file using the `ngx_http_mp4_module`. This implies that the module is enabled in nginx, and the "mp4" directive is used in the configuration. The attacker needs to be able to get the crafted MP4 file to be processed by the vulnerable nginx instance.
