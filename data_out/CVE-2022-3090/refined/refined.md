- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. When attempting to open a file using a specific path, the user's password hash is sent to an arbitrary host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could obtain user credential hashes.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to send a malicious file path, exploiting the path traversal vulnerability. No specific user interaction is needed (PR:N, UI:N)
