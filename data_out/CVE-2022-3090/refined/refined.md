- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, known as path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22). The software does not properly restrict the file paths it accepts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain user credential hashes by sending the user's password hash to an arbitrary host when attempting to open a file using a specific path.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity. The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to open a file using a specific path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N). The attacker can exploit it remotely (AV:N).
