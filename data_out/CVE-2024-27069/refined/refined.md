The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27069.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a race condition in the overlayfs copy up operation where a lower file's size can change underneath the overlayfs. This can lead to inconsistencies in the positions during copy up.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ovl_verify_area` function uses `WARN_ON_ONCE` assertions to check for inconsistencies in the copy up positions.
- The inconsistencies can occur when the size of a lower file is modified while copy up operation is in progress
- This situation was causing a `WARN_ON_ONCE` assertion during the copy up process, which is not intended behavior in this specific use case.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a `WARN_ON_ONCE` assertion in the kernel, which although not a security vulnerability, indicates a problem. The kernel will continue working.
- The intended behavior in this situation should have been to return an `-EIO` error rather than causing a kernel assertion.
- The undefined behavior can cause issues during data copy up.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could cause the vulnerability by changing the size of the lower file while the overlayfs copy-up operation is in progress.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a copy-up operation in overlayfs.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the size of a lower file while the copy-up operation is taking place.
