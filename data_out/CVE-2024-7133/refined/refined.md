- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape user-supplied settings before outputting them on the page. Specifically, the `mysticky_option_welcomebar[mysticky_welcomebar_fontsize]` field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when an admin user edits or creates a bar, intercepts the save request, modifies the `mysticky_option_welcomebar[mysticky_welcomebar_fontsize]` field with malicious payload and saves. The XSS is triggered when editing the bar again.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with administrative privileges to access the plugin's settings page.
