## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# My Sticky Bar < 2.7.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its settings before outputting them back in the page, which could allow users with a high role to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Edit/create a Bar, intercept the request made when saving it, change mysticky\_option\_welcomebar%5Bmysticky\_welcomebar\_fontsize%5D field to 1123"dshf=+"";shfd="\";</style><img+src=x+onerror=alert(1)> and send it
The XSS will be triggered when editing the bar again
