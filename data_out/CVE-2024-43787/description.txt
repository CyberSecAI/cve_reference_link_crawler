Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Hono CSRF middleware can be bypassed using crafted Content-Type header. MIME types are case insensitive, but isRequestedByFormElementRe only matches lower-case. As a result, attacker can bypass csrf middleware using upper-case form-like MIME type. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.8.
