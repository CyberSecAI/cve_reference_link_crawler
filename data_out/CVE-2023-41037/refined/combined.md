# Cleartext Signed Message Signature Spoofing

Moderate

[larabr](/larabr)
published
GHSA-ch3c-v47x-4pgp
Aug 29, 2023

## Package

npm

openpgpjs
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 4.10.10, 5 - 5.10.0

## Patched versions

5.10.1, 4.10.11

## Description

### Impact

OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools:

```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

This text is signed.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

wnUEARMIACcFgmTkrNAJkInXCgj0fgcIFiEE1JlKzzDGQxZmmHkYidcKCPR+
BwgAAKXDAQDWGhI7tPbhB+jlKwe4+yPJ+9X8aWDUG60XFNi/w8T7ZgEAsAGd
WJrkm/H5AXGZsqyqqO6IWGF0geTCd4mWm/CsveM=
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

```

These messages typically contain a "Hash: ..." header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest.

OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the "Hash: ..." texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed.

A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead *visually trusting* the contents of the original message:

```
const cleartextMessage = `
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
This text is not signed but you might think it is. Hash: SHA256

This text is signed.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

wnUEARMIACcFgmTkrNAJkInXCgj0fgcIFiEE1JlKzzDGQxZmmHkYidcKCPR+
BwgAAKXDAQDWGhI7tPbhB+jlKwe4+yPJ+9X8aWDUG60XFNi/w8T7ZgEAsAGd
WJrkm/H5AXGZsqyqqO6IWGF0geTCd4mWm/CsveM=
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
`;
const message = await openpgp.readCleartextMessage({ cleartextMessage });
const verificationResult = await verifyCleartextMessage({ message, verificationKeys });
console.log(await verificationResult.verified); // output: true
console.log(verificationResult.data); // output: 'This text is signed.'
```

Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable.

Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature.

Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a "sanitised" version, with the extraneous text being removed.

Because of this, we consider the vulnerability impact to be very limited when the CleartextMessage is processed programmatically; this is reflected in the Severity CVSS assessment, specifically in the scope's score ("Unchanged").

### Patches

* v5.10.1 (current stable version) will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()`
* v4.10.11 (legacy version) will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`

### Workarounds

Check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
