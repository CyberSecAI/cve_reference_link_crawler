Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-7274**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper filtering of the `rcode` parameter in the `retation_status.php` and `/summary.php` pages. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization on the `rcode` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to data breaches (reading sensitive data), modification or deletion of data, and potentially taking control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via HTTP POST requests to the `/retation_status.php` and `/summary.php` endpoints. The attacker must include the malicious SQL code in the `rcode` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the administrator account of the Alton Management System.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
