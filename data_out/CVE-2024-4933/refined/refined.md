Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `$_GET['id']` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the value of the `id` parameter, taken directly from the URL, is used in a SQL query, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
*   **Direct parameter usage:** The application directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter value within the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including usernames, database names, and potentially other confidential data by manipulating the SQL queries.
*   **Data Modification:**  It's likely an attacker could modify data, potentially delete records, or insert malicious code/data within the database by crafting SQL queries
*   **Privilege Escalation** If the application connects to the database with a highly privileged user, an attacker might be able to gain access to the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the HTTP GET request.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:**  An attacker crafts malicious SQL fragments within the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   Basic knowledge of SQL syntax is needed to craft SQL injection payloads
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable URL is: `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/index.php?page=manage_product&id=1`

The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['id']`.

The content shows examples of how to test and exploit the vulnerability using `UNION SELECT` statements to extract database information. It also shows sqlmap being able to detect the vulnerability.
