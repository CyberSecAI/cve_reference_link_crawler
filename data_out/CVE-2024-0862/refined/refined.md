**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) within the Proofpoint Encryption endpoint of Proofpoint Enterprise Protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows an authenticated user to send HTTP requests originating from the Proofpoint Protection server to potentially private network addresses. This indicates a lack of proper input validation and sanitization when handling user-provided URLs or network addresses.

- The impact is rated as "MEDIUM" with a CVSS score of 5.0
- Confidentiality impact is rated as low, integrity impact is none and no impact to availablity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network (AV:N).
- The attack requires an authenticated user (PR:L) and does not require any user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Proofpoint Enterprise Protection application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Proofpoint encryption endpoint which is affected by SSRF.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that Proofpoint has released patches to address the issue.
- The vulnerability affects on-premise customers who have not applied the relevant patches.
- Proofpoint on-demand customers are already protected.
