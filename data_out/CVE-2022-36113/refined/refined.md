Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36113:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from Cargo's handling of package extraction. Specifically, Cargo does not prevent packages from containing a symbolic link named `.cargo-ok`. After extracting the package, Cargo attempts to write "ok" to the `.cargo-ok` file to mark successful extraction. If the `.cargo-ok` is a symbolic link, Cargo overwrites the first two bytes of the target file with `ok`, instead of creating a new file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Symbolic Link Handling:** Cargo incorrectly processes symbolic links during package extraction. It does not check if the `.cargo-ok` file is a symlink before writing to it.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Due to the improper symlink handling, an attacker can achieve arbitrary file overwrite by creating a malicious package that contains a `.cargo-ok` symlink pointing to another file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Corruption:** An attacker can corrupt the initial two bytes of any file on the system where Cargo extracts the malicious package. This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or potentially more severe impacts depending on the corrupted file.
- **Limited Scope**: This vulnerability is limited to the first two bytes of a file

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Package:** An attacker needs to create a malicious package that contains a symbolic link named `.cargo-ok` pointing to a target file on the victim's system.
- **Alternate Registries:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users who download packages from alternate registries other than crates.io. Packages from crates.io are not affected due to server-side checks that reject malicious packages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Package Upload:** The attacker needs the ability to upload malicious packages to an alternate registry that is used by the victim.
- **Target System Access**: The attacker is not required to have direct access to the victim's machine other than the ability to get them to download their malicious package.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to download and extract a malicious crate from the alternate registry.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Ori Hollander from JFrog Security Research.
- The fix involves preventing the extraction of `.cargo-ok` from the crate by adding a check in the source code. The fix is included in Rust 1.64 and later.
-  The advisory mentions that even with the fix, Cargo allows arbitrary code execution through build scripts and procedural macros, emphasizing the importance of trusting dependencies.
