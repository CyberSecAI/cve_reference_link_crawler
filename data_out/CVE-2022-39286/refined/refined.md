Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-39286:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `jupyter_core` application loads configuration files from the current working directory (CWD) without validating the ownership of those files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Because the application trusts and executes files from the CWD, an attacker can inject malicious code by creating a specially crafted configuration file.
- **Missing file ownership validation:** The lack of verification of file ownership allows an attacker to place configuration files that will be processed by a different user with potentially higher privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:**  A lower-privileged user can execute code as another user if that user happens to run a `jupyter_core` application in a directory controlled by the attacker. This leads to privilege escalation.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system in the context of another user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local file system:** An attacker writes a malicious configuration file (e.g., `dummy_app_config.py`) into a directory that another user will use as the CWD when running a `jupyter_core` based application.
- **Configuration file loading:** The `jupyter_core` application, upon initialization, searches for and loads configuration files from the CWD.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have write access to a directory that is used as the CWD by the target user when they execute a `jupyter_core` based application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix involves modifying `jupyter_core/application.py` to not include the CWD in the default config file paths.
- The vulnerability is present in versions `<=4.11.1` and is fixed in version `4.11.2` and later.
- The vulnerability affects multiple distributions including Fedora, Gentoo and Debian.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable because the attacker doesn't necessarily need to be logged into the system to create files in a location which is used as CWD by a different user.
