|  | [CVE ID] |
| --- | --- |
|  | CVE-2024-37868 |
|  | [PRODUCT] |
|  | Itsourcecode |
|  | [VERSION] |
|  | V1.0 |
|  | [PROBLEM TYPE] |
|  | File Upload Vulnerability |
|  | [DESCRIPTION] |
|  | The file upload operation was triggered on line 12 of the "sendreply.php" file, and the uploaded file was received using the "$- FILES" variable. Due to the lack of appropriate input validation and cleaning, remote attackers only need to use regular user login to pass malicious payloads through this file upload function, resulting in unrestricted file uploads, which may further lead to remote code execution (RCE). |
