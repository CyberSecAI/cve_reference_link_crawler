The provided content is related to CVE-2024-37868.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `send_reply.php` file. Specifically, the code directly uses the `$_FILES` variable to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in `send_reply.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones (e.g., PHP scripts).
- This can lead to:
    - File overwrite
    - File injection
    - Directory traversal attacks
    - Denial of service attacks
    - Remote code execution (RCE)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the `send_reply.php` file.
- Attackers can use a regular user login to access the file upload function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to access the vulnerable functionality.
- They need to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `send_reply.php` endpoint with a malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable file is `send_reply.php` located within the admin panel directory (`/admin/admin_forum/`).
- The vulnerable code is located at line 12 of `send_reply.php`.
- The specific software affected is the "Online Discussion Forum Project in PHP with Source Code" by Itsourcecode.
- The identified version of the affected software is V1.0.
- The provided POC demonstrates sending a malicious PHP file named `shelllll.php`
- The attacker can subsequently execute the uploaded PHP script on the server by sending an HTTP request to the file's location.
