- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of an admin user to inject malicious PHP code into the Cacti log file by creating a device with a malicious hostname and then setting a PHP file as the log file path during the installation process. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands by visiting the log file URL with a crafted query string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Log Poisoning: Malicious code is injected into the log file.
    - Unrestricted File Extension: The installation process allows setting a PHP file as the log file path without validation.
    - Lack of Input Validation: The hostname input field is vulnerable to code injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting Cacti. An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the webserver user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attack through HTTP requests.
    - Exploitation via web interface, specifically the device creation and installation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Must have administrative privileges in the Cacti application.
    - Needs access to the Cacti web interface.
    - Requires knowledge of the vulnerable installation steps and log poisoning techniques.
