{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in Mosquitto when running in bridge mode. When Mosquitto actively establishes a bridge with a remote MQTT broker, messages published on topics starting with a wildcard may be forwarded to Mosquitto, bypassing validation of the bridge broker messages. This leads to a double-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability due to bypassed validation of bridge broker messages."
    ],
    "impact": "The program crashes due to the double-free vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious or non-compliant remote MQTT broker can send messages with topics starting with a wildcard to the Mosquitto broker, triggering the double-free.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or have access to a remote MQTT broker that connects to the vulnerable Mosquitto instance via a bridge."
  },
  "affected_versions": "All versions of Mosquitto are seemingly affected, including versions 2.0.9 and 2.0.15.",
    "patch_information": "The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.19. The fix involves changes to `src/bridge_topic.c` to properly handle remapped topics, and the addition of a test case `test/broker/06-bridge-remap-receive-wildcard.py` to prevent regressions.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when a bridge connection receives a crafted packet with a wildcard topic. The provided test setup uses a python script (`server.py`) to simulate a malicious remote broker, and a modified Mosquitto configuration (`test_br.conf`) with bridge settings that expose the vulnerability."
