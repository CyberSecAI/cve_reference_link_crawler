{
  "CVE-2023-38290": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Evenwell FQC app exposes local arbitrary command execution as system user due to a vulnerability in its handling of Intents and system properties, leading to a bypass of security restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper Input Handling: The FQC app's receiver crashes when an action string is missing, due to a faulty assumption that the action string will always be non-null.",
      "Insecure System Property Usage: The app uses the persist.sys.PreventPowerkey system property to determine when to execute commands, and this property is manipulated to bypass security checks.",
        "Unrestricted Command Execution: The FQC service executes commands with system privileges via the TurnOffHeater extra in the intent.",
        "Missing Access Control: Lack of proper checks and enforcement of access controls allows a malicious app to manipulate the system and perform unauthorized actions."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution as system user, allowing an attacker to perform various privileged actions such as granting arbitrary permissions, installing arbitrary apps, performing factory resets, recording the screen, injecting input events, and performing operations with AppOps.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local app with no special permissions sends crafted Intents to interact with the Evenwell FQC app. It sends an Intent to start a specific activity, then sends a malformed intent to the FQC's broadcast receiver to crash it. Finally, it sends an intent to the FQC service with the command to be executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious app installed on the device is required. No special permissions are needed by the attacker app beyond being able to send intents."
