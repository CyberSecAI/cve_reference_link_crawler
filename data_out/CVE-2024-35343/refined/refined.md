{
  "CVE-2024-35343": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `copy_file` function in the `web_server` binary processes the URI string and uses the portion of the URI string following \"/playback/\" as a filepath to open and read a file on the filesystem, without sanitizing or verifying this input.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties",
        "Improper input validation",
        "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the device's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information such as system files, configuration files, and user data.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending an HTTP GET request to the device's web interface with a URI containing \"/playback/\" followed by a file path.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable device's web interface"
  }
