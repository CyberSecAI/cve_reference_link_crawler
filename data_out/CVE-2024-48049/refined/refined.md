These scripts are executed when other users visit the affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A contributor role is required to exploit this vulnerability.
