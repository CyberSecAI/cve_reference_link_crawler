The provided content is an ICS advisory from CISA regarding multiple vulnerabilities in Airspan Networks' Mimosa product line, and it includes CVE-2022-21196.

**CVE-2022-21196 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper authorization and authentication checks on multiple API routes within the affected Mimosa products.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper Authorization (CWE-285).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial-of-service conditions, and the ability to obtain sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can have low skill.

**Additional Vulnerabilities**
The advisory also details other vulnerabilities within the same product line:
*   **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** Similar to CVE-2022-21196, this involves missing authorization checks on multiple API functions, leading to remote code execution, denial-of-service, and information disclosure. (CVE-2022-21141)
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918):** This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to backend APIs, potentially exposing secret keys, changing configurations, and gaining access to resources normally unavailable from outside. (CVE-2022-21215)
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** Improper sanitization of user input allows for SQL injection, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.(CVE-2022-21176)
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** A deserialization flaw allows for the creation of arbitrary classes, enabling potential malicious actions.(CVE-2022-0138)
*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** Insufficient input sanitization can allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands. (CVE-2022-21143)
*   **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327):** The use of unsalted MD5 for password hashing allows attackers to crack passwords. (CVE-2022-21800)

**Affected Products:**
* MMP: All versions prior to v1.0.3
* PTP C-series: Device versions prior to v2.8.6.1
* PTMP C-series and A5x: Device versions prior to v2.5.4.1

**Mitigations:**
The advisory recommends updating the affected products to the following versions, or later:
* MMP: Version 1.0.4
* PTP C5x/C5c: Version 2.9.0
* PTMP C-series/A5x: Version 2.9.0

Additionally, general security measures are suggested, such as minimizing network exposure, placing control systems behind firewalls, using VPNs for remote access, and keeping all software updated.
