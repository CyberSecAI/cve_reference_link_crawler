- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid` function when handling POST requests to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unbounded `strcpy_until` calls that copy data from POST parameters (`ssid`, `band`, `profile`, `action`) into fixed-size stack buffers without checking the length of the input.
  - Subsequent `strncpy` calls that copy the `ssid` and `profile` buffers into the `wrpOpDo_params` structure, which are also vulnerable to buffer overflows.
  - In the EAP115 variant, the vulnerability is further complicated by storing pointers to `wrpOpDo_params` fields on the stack, allowing for write-what-where primitive exploitation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Remote code execution via stack corruption.
  - In the EAP115, potentially arbitrary memory writes due to corrupted pointers.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint with oversized parameters for `ssid`, `band`, `profile`, and `action`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Authenticated access to the web interface.
  - Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the targeted endpoint.
