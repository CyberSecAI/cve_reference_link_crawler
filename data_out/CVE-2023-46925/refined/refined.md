The provided content discusses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Reportico, specifically versions 7.1, 7.1.21-beta and 8.1.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious code (HTML or JavaScript) into the website. When a victim views the infected page, the injected code executes in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal private information, bypass the browser's same-origin policy, and perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects XSS payloads into the title section when creating a report in the admin module of Reportico. It also appears to exist in multiple places of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have admin access to the Reportico application to create a new report.
