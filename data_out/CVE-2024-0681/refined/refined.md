### CVE-2024-0681

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Page Restriction WordPress plugin fails to properly restrict access to pages through the REST API. When a page is set to private, this setting is not enforced when accessing the page through the REST API, leading to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Protection Mechanism Failure:** The plugin's access control mechanism is bypassed when using the REST API.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Private page content can be viewed by unauthenticated users via the REST API.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthenticated attackers can bypass the plugin's page restrictions and view the content of pages intended to be private.
*  Information disclosure of potentially sensitive content intended for specific roles, based on the specific page settings.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Directly accessing the WordPress REST API endpoint for a specific page.
*  Bypassing front-end restrictions by sending a request directly to the REST API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No special privileges or user account are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be an unauthenticated, remote user.
*   Knowledge of the WordPress siteâ€™s REST API endpoint structure for pages.

**Additional details:**

*   The vendor acknowledges the vulnerability but will not be fixing it in the plugin. They suggest adding an additional plugin for REST API Authentication.
*   The vendor has addressed the issue by adding notices in the dashboard, and recommends users install the WordPress REST API Authentication plugin for REST API protection.
* The vulnerability is present in all versions <= 1.3.4. It has been "fixed" by adding notices in the dashboard to inform of the lack of REST API protection.
