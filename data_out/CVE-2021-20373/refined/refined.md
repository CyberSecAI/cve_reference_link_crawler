Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-20373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The IBM Db2 LOAD utility, under certain circumstances, does not properly enforce directory restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper directory restriction enforcement in the Db2 LOAD utility. This allows the utility to access files outside of the intended directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the Db2 server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the use of the LOAD utility. The specific details of how an attacker would cause the LOAD utility to access restricted directories are not disclosed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to use the Db2 LOAD utility. This likely requires database access permissions. The specific level of privilege required is not detailed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Db2 server editions V9.7, V10.1, V10.5, V11.1, and V11.5 on all platforms.
- A special build containing an interim fix must be downloaded from Fix Central. The vulnerability is not fixed by standard updates.
- In addition to the special build, the registry variable `DB2_LOAD_RESTRICTED_IO_PATH` needs to be set to `USE_EXTBL_LOCATION` (v11.1.4.x and later) or one or more semi-colon separated paths, which likely defines the permitted paths for the LOAD utility.
- NetApp products were found not to be affected by the vulnerability, as they do not use the vulnerable component in a way that allows for exploitation.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive data through the Db2 LOAD utility due to its failure to enforce directory restrictions. The exploit requires a user to have the ability to run the LOAD utility and the attacker to craft a specific input to access restricted directories.
