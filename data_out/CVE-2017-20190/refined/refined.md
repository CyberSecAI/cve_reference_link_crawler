{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the excessive use of Unicode combining characters, known as Zalgo text, which can lead to rendering issues, text bleed, and performance degradation in applications that do not properly handle or limit them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper input validation or sanitization",
      "Inadequate handling of complex Unicode characters",
      "Insufficient text rendering capabilities",
      "Lack of resource limits or throttling"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact includes text overlapping, text bleeding into other UI elements, application unresponsiveness, and potential denial-of-service conditions. Malicious actors could potentially use this to obscure content, making it difficult to read, or cause crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Copy-pasting Zalgo text into text fields",
      "Sending messages containing Zalgo text"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to input or send the specially crafted Zalgo text into the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required."
