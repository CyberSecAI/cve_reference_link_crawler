Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input validation in the Webile v1.0.1 mobile web application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it to construct HTML responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS due to insufficient input validation. Malicious scripts injected into the `new_file_name` and `i` parameters of POST requests are stored and executed when the data is displayed in the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Session hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially steal user session cookies and hijack user sessions.
- **Persistent phishing attacks:** Attackers can use injected scripts to create fake login forms or redirect users to malicious websites, leading to persistent phishing attacks.
- **Persistent external redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to external malicious resources without their knowledge or consent.
- **Manipulation of affected application modules:** Attackers can manipulate the web application's functionality, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and via HTTP POST requests to `/file_action` and `/send` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application.
- No user account or high level of user interaction is needed for exploitation (guest privileges are sufficient).
- The attacker can be remote on the same network as the Webile server (since it runs on a local network).

**Technical Details & Description:**
- The vulnerability is present in the "send" and "add" functions of the application.
- Attackers can inject malicious script code into the `new_file_name` parameter (when adding a new file/folder) and `i` parameter (when sending a message) in POST requests.
- The injected script code is then persistently executed when the affected content is displayed.
- The proof of concept demonstrates how to inject javascript code, which is later rendered and executed in the client's browser
