| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2152703#c0)  Sage McTaggart    2022-12-12 18:23:38 UTC  ``` It is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines to add entries to /etc/passwd. Using the default SCC prevents the privesc. A malicious user could use a non-default SCC (anyuid, for example) that allows the process to become root on the host.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2152703#c5)  Anten Skrabec    2022-12-21 18:24:30 UTC  ``` Created cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2155654](show_bug.cgi?id=2155654 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-all]")]   Created cri-o:1.21/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 2155653](show_bug.cgi?id=2155653 "NEW - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.21/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [epel-8]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2152703#c6)  Anten Skrabec    2022-12-21 22:57:53 UTC  ``` Created cri-o:1.20/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155693](show_bug.cgi?id=2155693 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.20/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")]   Created cri-o:1.21/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155694](show_bug.cgi?id=2155694 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.21/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")]   Created cri-o:1.22/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155695](show_bug.cgi?id=2155695 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.22/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")]   Created cri-o:1.23/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155696](show_bug.cgi?id=2155696 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.23/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")]   Created cri-o:1.24/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155697](show_bug.cgi?id=2155697 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.24/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")] Affects: fedora-37 [[bug 2155699](show_bug.cgi?id=2155699 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.24/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-37]")]   Created cri-o:1.25/cri-o tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-36 [[bug 2155698](show_bug.cgi?id=2155698 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.25/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-36]")] Affects: fedora-37 [[bug 2155700](show_bug.cgi?id=2155700 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-4318 cri-o:1.25/cri-o: /etc/passwd tampering privesc [fedora-37]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2152703#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-03-07 10:47:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12  Via RHSA-2023:1033 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1033](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1033)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2152703#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-03-07 19:11:37 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
