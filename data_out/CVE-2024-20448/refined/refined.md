- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the improper storage of sensitive information within config only and full backup files generated by Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information, including NDFC-connected device credentials, the NDFC site manager private key, and the scheduled backup file encryption key, is improperly stored within backup files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access sensitive information, including device credentials, the site manager private key, and the encryption key for scheduled backup files.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to a backup file generated by an affected device can exploit this vulnerability by parsing the contents of the backup file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to a backup file generated from a vulnerable Cisco NDFC device. This could be achieved via various means including access to an administrative interface where backups are stored or via some form of data exfiltration from an organization's systems.
