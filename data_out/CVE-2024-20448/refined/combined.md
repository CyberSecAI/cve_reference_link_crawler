This vulnerability is due to the improper storage of sensitive information within config only and full backup files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by parsing the contents of a backup file that is generated from an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information, including NDFC-connected device credentials, the NDFC site manager private key, and the scheduled backup file encryption key.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
