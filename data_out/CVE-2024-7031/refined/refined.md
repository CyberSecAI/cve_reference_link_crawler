Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions` function within the File Manager Pro â€“ Filester WordPress plugin. This function is responsible for saving user role restrictions, such as allowed file upload types and disabled operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Capability Check:** The `njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions` function lacks a proper capability check to verify if the user making the request has the necessary permissions (e.g., administrator privileges) to modify plugin settings.
- **Nonce Misuse:** The plugin relies on a nonce for authorization but fails to check the user's role before allowing settings modifications. This allows any authenticated user with a valid nonce to modify plugin settings.
- **Insecure AJAX Handler:** The AJAX action `wp_ajax_njt_fs_save_setting_restrictions` is accessible to any authenticated user, as it doesn't verify user roles or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker with low-level access (e.g., a Subscriber) can modify the plugin settings to allow the upload of arbitrary file types, including `.php` files. This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Privilege Escalation:** Lower-privileged users can escalate their privileges by manipulating the settings and potentially gaining control over the site.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can alter the plugin's configuration, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access to files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **AJAX Request:** The attacker sends a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_njt_fs_save_setting_restrictions` endpoint, including a valid nonce and malicious settings data.
- **Plugin Settings:** Attackers exploit the lack of authorization within the `njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions` function to modify plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with access to the plugin. The lowest access level is Subscriber.
- **Access to Nonce:** The attacker needs to retrieve a valid nonce for the `njt-fs-file-manager-admin` action, which is embedded in the plugin's frontend code.

**More details than CVE description:**

The provided content gives a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability works including:
- The specific vulnerable function: `njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions`.
- The ability for any authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability, as long as they have a valid nonce and access to the plugin.
- The fact that the nonce is easily obtainable from the frontend.
- The ability to remove all restrictions for file upload and operations and upload malicious files.
- The root cause: missing capability check and nonce misuse.

Additionally, the content highlights related vulnerabilities in other plugins and the developer's failure to fix the reported issues. This context is not typically found in standard CVE descriptions.
