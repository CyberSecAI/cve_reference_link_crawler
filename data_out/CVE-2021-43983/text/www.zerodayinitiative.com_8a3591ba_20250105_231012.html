## WECON LeviStudioU UMP File Parsing BaseSet Tag ScrIdWordAddr Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-036ZDI-CAN-14573

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-43983](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43983) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [WECON](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | LeviStudioU |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WECON LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of BaseSet tags within UMP files. When parsing the ScrIdWordAddr attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | WECON has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
