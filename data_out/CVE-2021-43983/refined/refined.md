Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to multiple stack-based buffer overflows that occur while parsing project files in WECON LeviStudioU software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software lacks proper bounds checking when handling project files, leading to stack-based buffer overflows. This is identified as CWE-121.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable software. This could lead to a compromise of the HMI system and potentially the connected industrial control system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted project file within the LeviStudioU software. This requires the attacker to provide a malicious file to the user.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to get the targeted user to open a malicious project file in the vulnerable software. This implies a social engineering aspect as the user needs to be convinced to open the file.  The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to a system where the software can be run with the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected software is LeviStudioU, specifically versions 2019-09-21 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, with vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The affected sectors are Critical Manufacturing, Energy, and Water and Wastewater Systems.
*   There is no patch or mitigation provided by WECON and users are advised to contact the vendor for support.
*   The advisory recommends only using project files from trusted sources and being cautious of email scams and social engineering attacks.
