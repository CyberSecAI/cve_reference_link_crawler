## WECON LeviStudioU UMP File Parsing XY Tag WordAddr9 Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-047ZDI-CAN-14411

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-43983](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43983) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [WECON](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | LeviStudioU |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WECON LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XY tags within UMP files. When parsing the WordAddr9 attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | WECON has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## WECON LeviStudioU UMP File Parsing XY Tag WordAddr7 Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-043ZDI-CAN-14420

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-43983](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43983) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [WECON](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | LeviStudioU |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WECON LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of XY tags within UMP files. When parsing the WordAddr7 attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | WECON has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

## WECON LeviStudioU UMP File Parsing Alarm Tag WordAddr Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-045ZDI-CAN-14417

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-43983](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43983) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [WECON](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | LeviStudioU |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WECON LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of Alarm tags within UMP files. When parsing the WordAddr attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | WECON has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2021-08-05 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2022-01-13 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
