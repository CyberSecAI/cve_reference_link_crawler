Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs when processing MP4 format files with tsMuxer. Specifically, the issue lies within the `H264StreamReader::checkStream` function, leading to memory allocation without proper deallocation. Further indirect leaks are associated with the use of `std::vector`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak in `H264StreamReader::checkStream` function
- Indirect memory leaks related to `std::vector` usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion if the program processes multiple or large MP4 files, potentially causing the application to crash or become unstable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted or arbitrary MP4 file with tsMuxer can trigger the memory leak.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an MP4 file as input to the `tsmuxer` application.
