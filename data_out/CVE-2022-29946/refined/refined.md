The provided content is a security advisory for CVE-2022-29946, detailing a vulnerability in NATS server and streaming server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly enforce negative permissions when a user subscribes to a wildcard subject using a queue subscription. Specifically, if a user has a positive permission for a wildcard subject (e.g., `foo.*`) but a negative permission for a specific subject (e.g., `foo.bar`) matched by the wildcard, the user would still receive messages on `foo.bar` via a queue subscription to `foo.*`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect ACL Enforcement:** Negative permissions (denials) are not correctly applied in the context of queue subscriptions to wildcard subjects.
- **Bypass of Subject Access Control:** Users can receive messages on subjects they should be denied access to, due to the oversight in handling queue subscriptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information on subjects they are explicitly denied access to, by subscribing to a wildcard subject via a queue.
- **Data Exposure:** Malicious users or compromised accounts could receive messages they should not be authorized to receive, leading to data breaches and potential privacy violations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is by establishing a queue subscription to a wildcard subject for which the user has positive access rights, while also having a negative permission for a specific subject matching the wildcard.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **User Account with Specific Permissions:** The attacker must have a valid user account with a positive permission for a wildcard subject and a negative permission for a specific subject covered by that wildcard.
- **Queue Subscription Ability:** The attacker needs the ability to create a queue subscription on the relevant wildcard subject.
