- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF protection in some areas and proper sanitization and escaping of user inputs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing CSRF checks, and lack of sanitization and escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser, potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed via a CSRF attack where the attacker tricks a logged-in admin to open a malicious HTML page, which submits the malicious payload using a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in admin to open a malicious webpage to trigger the CSRF attack.
