Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) flaw in the "Page Theme" functionality of Form Tools version 3.1.1. The application allows an administrator to modify the page theme using a template string that is not properly sanitized. This enables the injection of malicious code within the template.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The application processes user-provided input as template code without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious template directives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** By injecting malicious template directives, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially access or manipulate sensitive data, including user accounts or application configuration.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** With arbitrary code execution, an attacker could gain full control over the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  The attacker must first gain administrative access to the Form Tools application.
2.  The attacker navigates to the "/admin/settings/index.php?page=accounts" page.
3.  The attacker changes the "Page Theme" template to a malicious string such as "{{7*7}}".
4.  The attacker saves the changes.
5.  The attacker creates a new user via /admin/clients/ or uses existing non-admin account.
6.  The attacker logs in with the non-admin account, triggering the execution of the injected template code, demonstrating SSTI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative privileges to access and modify the settings within the Form Tools application, specifically the "Page Theme" setting.
* **Access to a non-admin user account:** The attacker needs either a newly created or an existing non-admin user account to trigger the vulnerability.
