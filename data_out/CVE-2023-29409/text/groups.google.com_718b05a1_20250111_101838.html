Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.20.7 and 1.19.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/tls: restrict RSA keys in certificates to <= 8192 bits

  Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server

  to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. Limit this by

  restricting the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes to <=

  8192 bits.

  Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only

  three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all

  three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It

  is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target

  the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the

  default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.

  Thanks to Mateusz Poliwczak for reporting this issue.

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.20.7>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.20.7` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Matthew for the Go team
