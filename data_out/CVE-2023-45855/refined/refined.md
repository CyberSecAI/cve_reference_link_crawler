Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal

**Root Cause:** The application allows direct access to the `/uploads/` directory without proper input sanitization or access controls.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The application fails to restrict access to the `/uploads/` directory, allowing unauthorized users to browse its contents.
*   **Missing Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive files stored within the `/uploads/` directory or other parts of the server's file system, potentially including configuration files, source code, or user data.
*  **Potentially gain full access to the server:** Depending on the server configuration, it is possible to access files that could compromise the server.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific URL that includes directory traversal sequences to bypass the intended directory restrictions. The provided images show the attacker accessing the `/uploads/` folder directly via a browser.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with crafting HTTP requests to specify paths.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content specifically mentions accessing `/uploads/` directory.
*   The content includes screenshots demonstrating how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The exploited version of qdPM mentioned is 9.2.
