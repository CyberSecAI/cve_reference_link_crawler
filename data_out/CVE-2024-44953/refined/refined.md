- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deadlock occurs in the UFS driver when the runtime suspend process waits for the RTC work to complete, and the RTC work itself calls `ufshcd_rpm_get_sync()` which waits for the runtime resume, creating a circular dependency.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of power management and Real-Time Clock (RTC) update within the UFS driver, specifically the usage of `ufshcd_rpm_get_sync()` during RTC work. The RTC update was not checking the current power management state.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The deadlock can lead to a system freeze or unresponsiveness.

- **Attack vectors:** This is not a remote attack vector. This vulnerability is triggered by the device going into runtime suspend, while the RTC work is pending.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not have to have special capabilities or a specific position to trigger this bug. The condition can arise normally by a system undergoing runtime suspend, with an RTC update pending.
