Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `formQuickIndex` function of the Tenda FH1205 firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The `formQuickIndex` function receives the `PPPOEPassword` parameter from a POST request. This parameter is passed to the `decodePwd` function. Inside `decodePwd`, the input `PPPOEPassword` is copied to a buffer `v4`. If the input is larger than the fixed size of `v4` (72 bytes), a stack overflow occurs. The `decodePwd` function does not perform sufficient length checks, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack, an attacker could overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow could also crash the device, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/QuickIndex` endpoint.
- **`PPPOEPassword` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `PPPOEPassword`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. This likely means the attacker must be on the same network as the device or have network access to it through other means.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint/Parameter:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/QuickIndex` and the parameter `PPPOEPassword`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is `FH1205 V2.0.0.7(775)`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a large string in the `PPPOEPassword` parameter.
- The `decodePwd` function copies characters from the user-provided input `a1` to the destination buffer `a2`, and is vulnerable due to not validating the size of input against the size of the buffer.
