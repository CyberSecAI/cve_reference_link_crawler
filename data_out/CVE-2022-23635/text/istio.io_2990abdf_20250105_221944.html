## CVE

### CVE-2022-23635

* **[CVE-2022-23635](https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f)**:
  (CVSS Score 7.5, High): Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack.

The Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that
sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012,
but does not require any authentication from the attacker.

For simple installations, istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster topologies](/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/), this port is exposed over the public internet.

### Envoy CVEs

At this time it is not believed that Istio is vulnerable to these CVEs in Envoy. They are listed, however,
to be transparent.

| [CVE-2022-21656](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c9g7-xwcv-pjx2) | 3.1, Low | X.509 `subjectAltName` matching (and `nameConstraints`) bypass. | No, next release. | No, next release. | Envoy did not backport this fix. |
| [CVE-2022-21657](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-837m-wjrv-vm5g) | 3.1, Low | X.509 Extended Key Usage and Trust Purposes bypass | No, next release. | No, next release. | No, next release. |

## Am I Impacted?

You are at most risk if you are running Istio in a multi-cluster environment, or if you have exposed your istiod externally.
