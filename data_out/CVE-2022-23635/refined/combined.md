# Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack

High

[howardjohn](/howardjohn)
published
GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f
Feb 22, 2022

## Package

docker

Istio
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<1.13.1

## Patched versions

1.13.1, 1.12.4, 1.11.7

## Description

### Impact

The Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker.

For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet.

### Patches

* Istio 1.13.1 and above
* Istio 1.12.4 and above
* Istio 1.11.7 and above

### Workarounds

There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.

### References

More details can be found in the [Istio Security Bulletin](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-003)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## CVE

### CVE-2022-23635

* **[CVE-2022-23635](https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f)**:
  (CVSS Score 7.5, High): Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack.

The Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that
sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012,
but does not require any authentication from the attacker.

For simple installations, istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster topologies](/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/), this port is exposed over the public internet.

### Envoy CVEs

At this time it is not believed that Istio is vulnerable to these CVEs in Envoy. They are listed, however,
to be transparent.

| [CVE-2021-43826](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-cmx3-fvgf-83mf) | 6.1, Medium | Use-after-free when tunneling TCP over HTTP, if downstream disconnects during upstream connection establishment. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [CVE-2022-21654](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-5j4x-g36v-m283) | 7.3, High | Incorrect configuration handling allows mTLS session re-use without re-validation after validation settings have changed. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [CVE-2022-21655](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-7r5p-7fmh-jxpg) | 7.5, High | Incorrect handling of internal redirects to routes with a direct response entry. | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [CVE-2022-23606](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-9vp2-4cp7-vvxf) | 4.4, Moderate | Stack exhaustion when a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service. | Yes | Yes | N/A |
| [CVE-2022-21656](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c9g7-xwcv-pjx2) | 3.1, Low | X.509 `subjectAltName` matching (and `nameConstraints`) bypass. | No, next release. | No, next release. | Envoy did not backport this fix. |
| [CVE-2022-21657](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-837m-wjrv-vm5g) | 3.1, Low | X.509 Extended Key Usage and Trust Purposes bypass | No, next release. | No, next release. | No, next release. |

## Am I Impacted?

You are at most risk if you are running Istio in a multi-cluster environment, or if you have exposed your istiod externally.

## Credit

We would like to thank Adam Korczynski ([`ADA Logics`](https://adalogics.com)) and John Howard (Google) for the report and the fix.
