Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-20719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incomplete sanitization of parameters within the Cisco IOx application hosting environment. Specifically, parameters passed as part of the IOx package descriptor are not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Parameter Injection:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to parameter injection due to insufficient input sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate parameters intended for the IOx package descriptor.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the input parameters, which makes the system vulnerable to malicious code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with `root` privileges on the underlying host operating system. This is the most severe consequence.
*  **File Removal**: An attacker can remove arbitrary files using a crafted IOx package descriptor file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **IOx API:** The attacker interacts with the Cisco IOx API to carry out the attack.
*   **Crafted IOx Package Descriptor File:** The attack is initiated by creating a malicious IOx package descriptor file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated, remote user with access to the Cisco IOx API.
*   **Crafting Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious IOx package descriptor file.
*   **Deployment:** The attacker needs to deploy an application in the Cisco IOx environment utilizing the crafted descriptor file.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco platforms.
* There are no workarounds, only a mitigation (disabling IOx).
* Successful exploitation grants root privileges on the host operating system, making this a high-impact vulnerability.
* The advisory states that a software update is required to fix this vulnerability
* The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOx application hosting environment.
* This CVE was reported by Cyrille CHATRAS of Orange group.
