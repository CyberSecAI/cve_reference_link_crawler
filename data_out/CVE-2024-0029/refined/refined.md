{
  "CVE-2024-0029": {
    "Root cause": "The framework used a single integer to track screen capture disabled policy across the device. This was problematic as it couldn't represent policies from multiple admins or both the admin and its parent. Additionally, when a non-managed user was started, its default policy state would override existing policies, re-enabling screen capture.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect tracking of screen capture disabled policies across multiple users",
      "Policy refresh mechanism in DevicePolicyManagerService overriding existing policies"
     ],
    "Impact": "Screen capture policies set by device administrators could be overridden, potentially allowing unauthorized screen captures.",
    "Attack vectors": "Starting a non-managed user could override the screen capture disabled policy set by administrators",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker would need to start a non-managed user on the device."
