### Bug Description

Hello,

  I found a heap-buffer overflow in function ttfLoadHDMX; ttfdump can install by apt-get texlive-binaries. I compile lastest texlive-source by clone <https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/> on unbuntu for debugging.

  The overflow content and size are controlled by input. Exploiting this issue can achive any code excuted

The steps for reproducing the vul on unbuntu:

  (1) sudo apt-get iunstall texlive-binaries

  (2) ttfdump -i poc.ttf

The poc.ttf can view the attachment .ttfdump aborted and prompt "malloc(): corrupted top size" due memory corrupt.

The issue exist in function ttfLoadHDMX :

/\*\*\* function ttfLoadHDMX begin \*\*\*/

static void ttfLoadHDMX (FILE \*fp,HDMXPtr hdmx,ULONG offset)

{

    int i;

xfseek(fp, offset, SEEK\_SET, "ttfLoadHDMX");

hdmx->version = ttfGetUSHORT(fp);

    hdmx->numDevices = ttfGetUSHORT(fp);

    hdmx->size = ttfGetLONG(fp);

hdmx->Records = XCALLOC (hdmx->numDevices, DeviceRecord);

for (i=0;i<hdmx->numDevices;i++)

 {

     hdmx->Records[i].PixelSize = ttfGetBYTE(fp);

     hdmx->Records[i].MaxWidth = ttfGetBYTE(fp);

     hdmx->Records[i].Width = XCALLOC (hdmx->size, BYTE); (1)

     fread ((hdmx->Records+i)->Width, sizeof(BYTE), hdmx->numGlyphs+1,fp); (2)

 }

}

/\*\*\* function ttfLoadHDMX end \*\*\*/

At above code (1) ,allocte heap buffer for Width according to the parsed hdmx width. And at above code (2) , copy Width content from file and copy size decided by controlled hdmx->numGlyphs. In the poc , hdmx->size eaqual to 1216 and hdmx->numGlyphs+1 is 4155,which get heap buffer overflow.

/\*\*\* debug info \*\*\*/

(gdb) p hdmx->numGlyphs+1

$23 = 4155

(gdb) p hdmx->size

$24 = 1216

/\*\*\* debug info end \*\*\*/

Thanks for reporting this issue. Have you notified the texlive developer so that they can work on a fix? If not, please file a bug with them. Once they have developed a fix, we can include it in Ubuntu. Thanks!

I have marked this bug as public because the public domain already contains information about this TeX Live issue (as seen in the GitHub issue and upstream changelog).

@dongzhuo, could you please contact the upstream (either in the existing PR or via their mailing list) to confirm that they (1) recognize this issue as a vulnerability impacting the security of their software (and not just a functional bug), and (2) do not have any other CVE ID assignment process already established? The latter is important because some projects prefer contacting MITRE for the assignment.

Hello，I have reported this issue to TexLive and the maintenance team have

confirmed this issue and fixed it. they want me reuest CVE ID by myself.

And Iasrequest a CVE ID, but do not get answer for this moment. If you

could accelerate this requesting process, that would be great!
