- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to arbitrary code execution in SMRAM via SMI.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated attacker can gain arbitrary code execution in SMRAM, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with administrative privileges can send a specially crafted SMI to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system with administrative privileges is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs the ability to send SMI.
