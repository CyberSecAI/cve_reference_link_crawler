## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# TI WooCommerce Wishlist < 2.9.1 - Unauthenticated SQL Injection via lang parameters

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Proof of Concept

add or remove wishlist items and add the following extra params to the post request:
lang=%5C&lang\_default=,0) OR t.language\_code=sleep(10)--+
the plugin "sitepress-multilingual-cms" have to be present for this to work.
