- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow exists in the `GetParentControlInfo` function due to a lack of length validation on user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the `httpd` process, or potentially execute arbitrary code remotely.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/goform/GetParentControlInfo` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
