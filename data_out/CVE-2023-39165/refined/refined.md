- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Sign-up Sheets plugin (versions <= 2.2.8) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated. The specific impact would vary depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. A malicious actor could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into sending a malicious request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but must target an authenticated user.
