- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `SupercheckoutSupercheckoutModuleFrontController::saveFileTypeCustomField()` method in the "Module One Page Checkout, Social Login & Mailchimp" module allows unrestricted upload of files with dangerous extensions, specifically `.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload (CWE-434) leading to potential arbitrary code execution (CWE-94).
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Steal data
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation of the front controller of the PrestaShop module. Attackers can conceal the module controllerâ€™s path during the exploit, making it hard to identify in conventional frontend logs. The POST request will only be shown as `POST /` in logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated (guest) and requires no user interaction to execute the attack.

The advisory also notes that the exploit is actively exploited in the wild, and that using a web application firewall (WAF) such as mod_security with the AuditEngine enabled is the only way to gain detailed logs of this specific vulnerability exploitation.
