The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47547.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds access vulnerability exists in the `mii_get_phy` function within the `de4x5.c` driver. The issue occurs when iterating through the `lp->phy` array, which has a fixed size of 8 (DE4X5_MAX_PHY). If all IDs within the array are non-zero, the loop counter `k` increments to 8. Subsequently, an attempt to access `lp->phy[k]` where `k` is 8, results in an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds array access.
- Insufficient bounds checking on the loop counter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution, as the out-of-bounds write could overwrite sensitive kernel memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the driver attempts to discover and initialize a large number of physical MII devices, specifically when the id field of all the phy array members is non-zero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to load and control the behavior of the `de4x5.c` network driver in the Linux kernel which could involve physical access or the ability to insert network devices that the driver will try to detect. The attacker would then need to ensure that the driver would encounter a situation in which all phy array id fields are non-zero.
