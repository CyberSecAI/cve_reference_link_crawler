Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` URL parameter in the `edit_customer` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `id` parameter from the URL into a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to:
  - **Data Breaches:**  Unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive data.
  - **Data Modification:** Altering or deleting data within the database.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Potentially disrupt the application's functionality.
  - **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher access levels within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/index.php` page, specifically targeting the `edit_customer` page and manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the application's web interface.
- **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct malicious SQL queries.
- **Ability to modify HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL parameters.

**More detail than CVE description:**

The provided GitHub content offers more detail, including:

-   **Specific vulnerable endpoint:** `edit_customer` page via the `id` parameter.
-   **A sample payload:** `(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)` which demonstrates the SQL injection by inducing a 5 second sleep.
-   **A sample HTTP request** showing how the payload is injected.
-   **Detailed steps to reproduce:** This outlines the exact user actions to trigger the vulnerability.
