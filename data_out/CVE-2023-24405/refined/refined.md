- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation can be achieved by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website that makes the malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action, and therefore doesn't require direct access to the application itself. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
