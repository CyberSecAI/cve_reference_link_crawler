**CVE-2022-37311**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The size of request parameters for certain API endpoints were not sufficiently checked.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
*  **Impact of exploitation**:  Requests with large parameters can cause the server to consume excessive memory, leading to resource exhaustion and making the system unresponsive for all users.
*   **Attack vectors**: Sending a large "location" request parameter to the "redirect" servlet.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to send the malicious request. The attacker can be unauthenticated, and send requests via network.
