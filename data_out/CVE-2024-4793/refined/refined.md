Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) into an SQL query within the `manage_laundry.php` file. This occurs without any form of sanitization or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization and the direct inclusion of user-controlled data in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially leading to:
  - Unauthorized data access or modification.
  - Complete database takeover
  - Potential for further attacks on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the GET request to `/manage_laundry.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must be able to modify the `id` GET parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet in `manage_laundry.php`:
  ```php
  if(isset($_GET['id'])){
  	$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM laundry_list where id =".$_GET['id']);
  	foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
  		$$k = $v;
  	}
  }
  ```
- The provided SQLMap command demonstrates successful exploitation:
  ```
  python3 sqlmap.py -r 1.txt -p id --current-user --batch --dbms mysql
  ```

**Additional Information**
- Vendor: Campcodes
- Product: Online Laundry Management System
- Version: 1.0
- Affected File: `/manage_laundry.php`
- The vulnerability was successfully tested with a GET request injecting malicious SQL code.
