Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9049

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Button Group module of the Beaver Builder plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page. This is a DOM-based XSS because the injected script modifies the DOM of the page on the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view the page containing the injected XSS payload.
*   **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing website content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Potentially gaining control over the WordPress website if the administrator views the malicious page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Button Group Module:** The vulnerability exists in the Button Group module of the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript through user-supplied attributes within the module settings.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected code is stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Contributor-level Access or Higher:** The attacker must have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site, which allows them to use the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   **Access to the Beaver Builder Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access and modify content using the Beaver Builder plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Beaver Builder plugin up to and including 2.8.3.6 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.8.3.7 of the Beaver Builder plugin.
*   **Researcher:** The vulnerability was discovered by zer0gh0st.
