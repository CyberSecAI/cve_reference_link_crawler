The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52611.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a hardware bug in the SDIO controller of the Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC, which limits DMA transfers to 1536 bytes via the controller's SRAM. Additionally, rtw88 chips do not split incoming RX packets and can perform RX aggregation, potentially exceeding the host's maximum request size, leading to `skb_over_panic` errors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The rtw88 driver's `rtw_sdio_read_port()` function does not honor the host's `max_req_size` when reading data from the SDIO device.
- The driver reads the entire data in one MMC/SDIO transfer, even if it exceeds the `max_req_size`.
- When a receive error occurs, the driver does not drain the remaining data from the card's buffer, which causes corrupted data for subsequent reads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to `skb_over_panic` errors, which may result in system instability or crashes.
- Corrupted data may be received by the driver, which could lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the rtw88 driver receives data from the SDIO device that exceeds the host's `max_req_size` or when receive errors occur.
- Specifically, systems using the Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC with a RTL8822CS SDIO wifi/Bluetooth combo card are susceptible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker doesn't need special capabilities to trigger this vulnerability. It arises from a combination of hardware limitations and driver behavior during normal operation. The issue manifests when the system is using the affected hardware (Amlogic A311D SoC and RTL8822CS SDIO wifi).

The fix involves:
- Reading data in chunks no larger than the host's `max_req_size` in `rtw_sdio_read_port()`.
- Draining the remaining data from the card's buffer when receive errors occur.
