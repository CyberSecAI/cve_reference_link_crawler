### Description

WPvivid Backup & Migration Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHAR Deserialization in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.99 via deserialization of untrusted input at the wpvividstg\_get\_custom\_exclude\_path\_free action. This is due to the plugin not providing sufficient path validation on the tree\_node[node][id] parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin-level access and above, to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
