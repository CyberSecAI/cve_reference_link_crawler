Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-4701:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the `wpr_activate_required_plugins` AJAX action within the Royal Elementor Addons plugin. This action is intended to activate specific plugins ('contact-form-7', 'media-library-assistant', or 'woocommerce') if they are installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The AJAX action `wpr_activate_required_plugins` does not perform capability checks, meaning it's accessible to any authenticated user, including those with low-level privileges like subscribers.
*   **Missing Nonce Check:** The AJAX action lacks a nonce check, which would normally prevent CSRF attacks by verifying the authenticity of the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can activate the 'contact-form-7', 'media-library-assistant', or 'woocommerce' plugins if they are installed on the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The impact is considered relatively low because the attacker can only activate these three specific plugins and not any arbitrary plugins.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a network.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site (any user, including a subscriber).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site.
*   No special skills are required, other than knowing the vulnerable AJAX endpoint and how to send a request to it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided code snippet from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows the implementation of the `wpr_activate_required_plugins` function, which activates the mentioned plugins.
*   The Wordfence articles highlight that this is one of several vulnerabilities discovered in the plugin, all related to insufficient access controls and lack of nonce checks on various AJAX actions.
*   The `wordfence.com` content provides additional details on the vulnerability, including a CVSS score of 4.3 and its classification as a "Low" severity issue, along with the affected versions and the fix.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of access control and nonce checks in the  `wpr_activate_required_plugins` AJAX action. This allows a low-privileged authenticated user to activate the 'contact-form-7', 'media-library-assistant', or 'woocommerce' plugins. Although this is not a high severity issue, it is still a security flaw and should be addressed by updating to the patched version of the plugin.
