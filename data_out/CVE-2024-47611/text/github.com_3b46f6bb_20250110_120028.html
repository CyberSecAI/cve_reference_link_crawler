Windows: Embed an application manifest in the EXE files

IMPORTANT: This includes a security fix to command line tool
           argument handling.

Some toolchains embed an application manifest by default to declare
UAC-compliance. Some also declare compatibility with Vista/8/8.1/10/11
to let the app access features newer than those of Vista.

We want all the above but also two more things:

  - Declare that the app is long path aware to support paths longer
    than 259 characters (this may also require a registry change).

  - Force the code page to UTF-8. This allows the command line tools
    to access files whose names contain characters that don't exist
    in the current legacy code page (except unpaired surrogates).
    The UTF-8 code page also fixes security issues in command line
    argument handling which can be exploited with malicious filenames.
    See the new file w32_application.manifest.comments.txt.

Thanks to Orange Tsai and splitline from DEVCORE Research Team
for discovering this issue.

Thanks to Vijay Sarvepalli for reporting the issue to me.

Thanks to Kelvin Lee for testing with MSVC and helping with
the required build system fixes.

|  |  | Windows application manifest for UTF-8 and long paths |
|  |  | ===================================================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The .manifest file is embedded as is in the executables, thus |
|  |  | the comments are here in a separate file. These comments were |
|  |  | written in context of XZ Utils but might be useful when porting |
|  |  | other command line tools from POSIX environments to Windows. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | NOTE: On Cygwin and MSYS2, command line arguments and file |
|  |  | system access aren't tied to a Windows code page. Cygwin |
|  |  | and MSYS2 include a default application manifest. Replacing |
|  |  | it doesn't seem useful and might even be harmful if Cygwin |
|  |  | and MSYS2 some day change their default manifest. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | UTF-8 code page |
|  |  | --------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | On Windows, command line applications can use main() or wmain(). |
|  |  | With the Windows-specific wmain(), argv contains UTF-16 code units |
|  |  | which is the native encoding on Windows. With main(), argv uses the |
|  |  | system active code page by default. It typically is a legacy code |
|  |  | page like Windows-1252. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | NOTE: On POSIX, argv for main() is constructed by the calling |
|  |  | process. On Windows, argv is constructed by a new process |
|  |  | itself: a program receives the command line as a single string, |
|  |  | and the startup code splits it into individual arguments, |
|  |  | including quote removal and wildcard expansion. Then main() or |
|  |  | wmain() is called. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This application manifest forces the process code page to UTF-8 |
|  |  | when the application runs on Windows 10 version 1903 or later. |
|  |  | This is useful for programs that use main(): |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* UTF-8 allows such programs to access files whose names contain |
|  |  | characters that don't exist in the current legacy code page. |
|  |  | However, filenames on Windows may contain unpaired surrogates |
|  |  | (invalid UTF-16). Such files cannot be accesses even with the |
|  |  | UTF-8 code page. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* UTF-8 avoids a security issue in command line argument handling: |
|  |  | If a command line contains Unicode characters (for example, |
|  |  | filenames) that don't exist in the current legacy code page, |
|  |  | the characters are converted to similar-looking characters |
|  |  | with best-fit mapping. Some best-fit mappings result in ASCII |
|  |  | characters that change the meaning of the command line, which |
|  |  | can be exploited with malicious filenames. For example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Double quote (") breaks quoting and makes argument |
|  |  | injection possible. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Question mark (?) is a wildcard character which may |
|  |  | expand to one or more filenames. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Forward slash (/) makes a directory traversal attack |
|  |  | possible. This character can appear in a dangerous way |
|  |  | even from a wildcard expansion; a look-alike character |
|  |  | doesn't need to be passed directly on the command line. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | UTF-8 avoids best-fit mappings. However, it's still not |
|  |  | perfect. Unpaired surrogates (invalid UTF-16) on the command |
|  |  | line (including those from wildcard expansion) are converted |
|  |  | to the replacement character U+FFFD. Thus, filenames with |
|  |  | different unpaired surrogates appear identical when converted |
|  |  | to the UTF-8 code page and aren't distinguishable from |
|  |  | filenames that contain the actual replacement character U+FFFD. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If different programs use different code pages, compatibility issues |
|  |  | are possible. For example, if one program produces a list of |
|  |  | filenames and another program reads it, both programs should use |
|  |  | the same code page because the code page affects filenames in the |
|  |  | char-based file system APIs. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If building with a MinGW-w64 toolchain, it is strongly recommended |
|  |  | to use UCRT instead of the old MSVCRT. For example, with the UTF-8 |
|  |  | code page, MSVCRT doesn't convert non-ASCII characters correctly |
|  |  | when writing to console with printf(). With UCRT it works. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Long path names |
|  |  | --------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The manifest enables support for path names longer than 259 |
|  |  | characters if the feature has been enabled in the Windows registry. |
|  |  | Omit the longPathAware element from the manifest if the application |
|  |  | isn't compatible with it. For example, uses of MAX\_PATH might be |
|  |  | a sign of incompatibility. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Documentation of the registry setting: |
|  |  | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Summary of the manifest contents |
|  |  | -------------------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | See also Microsoft's documentation: |
|  |  | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | assemblyIdentity (omitted) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This is documented as mandatory but not all apps in the real world |
|  |  | have it, and of those that do, not all put an up-to-date version |
|  |  | number there. Things seem to work correctly without |
|  |  | <assemblyIdentity> so let's keep this simpler and omit it. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | compatibility |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Declare the application compatible with different Windows versions. |
|  |  | Without this, Windows versions newer than Vista will run the |
|  |  | application using Vista as the Operating System Context. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | trustInfo |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Declare the application as UAC-compliant. This avoids file system |
|  |  | and registry virtualization that Windows otherwise does with 32-bit |
|  |  | executables to make some ancient applications work. UAC-compliancy |
|  |  | also stops Windows from using heuristics based on the filename |
|  |  | (like setup.exe) to guess when elevated privileges might be |
|  |  | needed which would then bring up the UAC prompt. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | longPathAware |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Declare the application as long path aware. This way many file |
|  |  | system operations aren't limited by MAX\_PATH (260 characters |
|  |  | including the terminating null character) if the feature has |
|  |  | also been enabled in the Windows registry. |

|  |  | Force the process code page to UTF-8 on Windows 10 version 1903 |
|  |  | and later. For example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - main() gets the command line arguments in UTF-8 instead of |
|  |  | in a legacy code page. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - File system APIs that take char-based strings use UTF-8 |
|  |  | instead of a legacy code page. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Text written to the console via stdio.h's stdout or stderr |
|  |  | (like calling printf()) are expected to be in UTF-8. |

|  |  | CMake notes |
|  |  | ----------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | As of CMake 3.30, one can add a .manifest file as a source file but |
|  |  | it only works with MSVC; it's ignored with MinGW-w64 toolchains. |
|  |  | Embedding the manifest with a resource file works with all |
|  |  | toolchains. However, then the default manifest needs to be |
|  |  | disabled with MSVC in CMakeLists.txt to avoid duplicate |
|  |  | manifests which would break the build. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | w32\_application.manifest.rc: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | #include <winresrc.h> |
|  |  | CREATEPROCESS\_MANIFEST\_RESOURCE\_ID RT\_MANIFEST "w32\_application.manifest" |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Or the same thing without the #include: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1 24 "w32\_application.manifest" |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | CMakeLists.txt: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | if(MSVC) |
|  |  | set(CMAKE\_EXE\_LINKER\_FLAGS "${CMAKE\_EXE\_LINKER\_FLAGS} /MANIFEST:NO") |
|  |  | endif() |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | add\_executable(foo foo.c) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | # WIN32 isn't set on Cygwin or MSYS2, thus if(WIN32) is correct here. |
|  |  | if(WIN32) |
|  |  | target\_sources(foo PRIVATE w32\_application.manifest.rc) |
|  |  | set\_source\_files\_properties(w32\_application.manifest.rc PROPERTIES |
|  |  | OBJECT\_DEPENDS w32\_application.manifest |
|  |  | ) |
|  |  | endif() |
