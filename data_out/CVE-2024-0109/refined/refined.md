- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `cuobjdump` command when processing a malformed ELF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful exploit can cause a crash, leading to a limited denial of service. Specifically, the vulnerability causes an out of bounds read in the unprivileged process memory.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malformed ELF file to the `cuobjdump` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `cuobjdump` command with a crafted malformed ELF file. The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute the vulnerable command.
