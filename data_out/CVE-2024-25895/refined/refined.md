The provided content relates to CVE-2024-25895.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the failure of validation of user input, specifically the `Type` parameter in the `EventAttendance.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
- Performing actions within the application that the user can perform.
- Viewing any information that the user is able to view.
- Modifying any information that the user is able to modify.
- Initiating interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.
- Stealing sensitive information and hijacking user sessions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `Type` parameter of the `EventAttendance.php` endpoint. The attacker can induce a victim to click the malicious link through various means, including:
- Placing links on a website controlled by the attacker.
- Placing links on another website that allows content to be generated.
- Sending a link in an email, tweet, or other message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL with injected JavaScript. The attacker doesn't need direct access to the application server but needs a way to make the victim visit the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**
The specific vulnerable URL structure is:
`/EventAttendance.php?Action=List&Event=1&Type=<malicious_code>`
Where `<malicious_code>` is the injected JavaScript.
Example PoC: `/EventAttendance.php?Action=List&Event=1&Type=<img src="invalid.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')">`

**Remediation:**
The suggested remediation is:
1. Input validation: Sanitize or validate all user input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious code. This validation should be performed on the client-side and server-side.
2. Output encoding: All data that is displayed on a web page should be properly encoded to prevent script injection. This includes HTML entity encoding, URL encoding, or JavaScript escaping, depending on the context.
