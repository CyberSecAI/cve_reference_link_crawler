The script is activated through a link, which sends a request to a website with a vulnerability that enables execution of malicious scripts. If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can: Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. View any information that the user is able to view. Modify any information that the user is able to modify. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user. There are various means by which an attacker might induce a victim user to make a request that they control, to deliver a reflected XSS attack. These include placing links on a website controlled by the attacker, or on another website that allows content to be generated, or by sending a link in an email, tweet or other message. The attack could be targeted directly against a known user, or could be an indiscriminate attack against any users of the application.  Affected Component: /churchcrm/EventAttendance.php  Technical Details: The vulnerability is caused by the failure of validation of user input. An attacker can insert malicious js code, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious operations on behalf of the victim.  Proof of Concept (PoC): `<img src="invalid.jpg" onerror="alert('XSS')">`  Credits : Georgios Bitounis  Remediation: 1.Input validation: All user input should be validated to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and does not contain any malicious code. Input validation should be performed on client-side and should be designed to detect and block any attempts to inject scripts or other malicious content. 2.Output encoding: All data that is displayed on a web page should be properly encoded to prevent script injection. Proper encoding can include HTML entity encoding, URL encoding, or JavaScript escaping, depending on the specific context and data being displayed. |
