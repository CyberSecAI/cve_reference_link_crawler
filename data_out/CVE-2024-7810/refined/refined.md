Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_itprofile.php` file of the Online Graduate Tracer System. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal details, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential Server Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially gain information about the server infrastructure by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed using an HTTP POST request to `/tracking/admin/view_itprofile.php`.
*   **`id` parameter:** The `id` parameter within the POST request is the entry point for the SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the server.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** The vulnerable file is `/tracking/admin/view_itprofile.php`.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
*  **Proof of concept (POC):**  The provided POC demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using `updatexml()` function to extract the database name.

   ```
   This payload injects SQL code into the `id` parameter. The `updatexml()` function is used to retrieve the database name, demonstrating that the SQL query is vulnerable to injection.
