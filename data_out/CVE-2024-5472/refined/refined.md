- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP QuickLaTeX plugin does not sanitize or escape some of its settings, specifically the "Background Color" field under the Basic Settings tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with administrator privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute when an administrator views the plugin settings page.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1. Navigate to plugin settings page (`/admin.php?page=quicklatex-settings`).
    2. Select "Basic Settings tab".
    3. Input a malicious payload such as `"><script>alert(1)</script>` in the "Background Color" field.
    4. Save the settings.
    5. The XSS is triggered when the settings page is reloaded, executing the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or a user with the `edit_plugins` capability in WordPress, which is a high privilege role.
