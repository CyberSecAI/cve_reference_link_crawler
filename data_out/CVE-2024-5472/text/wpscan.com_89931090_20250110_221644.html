## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP QuickLaTeX < 3.8.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS in Background Color field

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1) Go to plugin settings (/admin.php?page=quicklatex-settings)
2) Select "Basic Settings tab"
3) In "Background Color", select Transparent and add the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
4) Save the settings and reload the page to trigger the XSS
