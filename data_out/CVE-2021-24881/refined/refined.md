- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly check for password protection and whether the post is public.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to validate password protection and public visibility of posts, allowing unauthorized access to protected content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can bypass the plugin's protection and access arbitrary posts, including private and draft content.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specifically crafted request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with parameters like `action=validate_input`, a valid `nonce`, and the target `post_id`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site and obtain a valid nonce, which can be retrieved from a post protected by the plugin.
