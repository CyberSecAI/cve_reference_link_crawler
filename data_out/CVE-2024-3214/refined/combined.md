### Description

The Relevanssi – A Better Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.22.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
