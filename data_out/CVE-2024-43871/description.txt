In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devres: Fix memory leakage caused by driver API devm_free_percpu()

It will cause memory leakage when use driver API devm_free_percpu()
to free memory allocated by devm_alloc_percpu(), fixed by using
devres_release() instead of devres_destroy() within devm_free_percpu().
