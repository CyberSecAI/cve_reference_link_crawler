{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing authentication for a critical function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Electrolink FM/DAB/TV transmitter allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially-crafted GET request to the command.cgi gateway. This request triggers a board reset, leading to denial of service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The device will reset, causing a denial of service. This will stop the transmitter from operating.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially-crafted GET request to the command.cgi gateway.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to have network access to the affected device."
