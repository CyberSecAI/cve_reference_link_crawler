Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper object-level access control within the `esp-idf` framework. Specifically, the application fails to validate if an authenticated user has the correct permissions to access data associated with the specified `id` parameter in the URL.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Access Control:** The system does not properly enforce access restrictions based on user roles or permissions when accessing resources via the `externalId` component.
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is directly used to access user data without proper validation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An authenticated attacker can access sensitive information belonging to other users by manipulating the `id` parameter.
    *   **Potential Manipulation:** The vulnerability may also allow for unauthorized modification of data, although this is not explicitly stated in this document.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
    *   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `id` parameter within a URL request.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an existing, valid user account on the system utilizing the vulnerable `esp-idf` framework.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send the crafted requests.

In summary, this is an object-level access control vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to access other user's sensitive data by changing the `id` parameter in the URL.
