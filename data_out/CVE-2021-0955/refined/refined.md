Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-0955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition in FuseDaemon leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to use a handle after it has been freed.
- Race condition: The vulnerability occurs because of a race condition between different threads or processes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The commit message does not specify the impact other than "use-after-free". The Android Security Bulletin describes the impact as: "The most severe vulnerability in this section could lead to memory corruption by a local attacker, with no privileges or user interaction required."

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker could exploit the race condition to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the device is required.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The FuseDaemon periodically runs `fadvise` on the lower file system to avoid double caching.
- The vulnerability occurs in the process of 'recording' the write for the `fadvise` queue.
- The race condition occurs due to the following sequence of events:
    - T1: `fuse_reply_write` is called.
    - T2: `pf_release` is called, destroying the handle.
    - T1: `Record` is called, using the already destroyed handle.
- The fix involves calling `Record` before `fuse_reply_write` to avoid the race.
