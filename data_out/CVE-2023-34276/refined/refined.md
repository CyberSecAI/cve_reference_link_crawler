{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the SOAP API interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DIR-2150 router.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the SOAP API interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. Authentication is required but can be bypassed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Although authentication is required, this mechanism can be bypassed. "
