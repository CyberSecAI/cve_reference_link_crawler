Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `getblockschedule` function within the Netgear RAX30 router firmware.
- The `getblockschedule` function uses `cmsUtl_strcpy` to copy data from a JSON object into a fixed-size stack buffer `s_3` without checking the length of the input data.
- When the "message" field is not present in the JSON payload, the code copies the entire json string instead.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121): The `strcpy` operation writes beyond the bounds of the fixed-size stack buffer `s_3`.
- Unchecked input: The code doesn't validate the length of the input data before copying it to the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router.
- Router compromise: The attacker can gain full control of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request: The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/rex_cgi` endpoint.
- JSON payload: The request must include a JSON payload with the "function" set to "getblockschedule" and a "data" field, and must *not* include a "message" field inside the "data" object.
- Crafted data: The data payload must include a long string to overflow the stack buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface. This typically involves knowing the administrator username and password or having an active session cookie.
- Network access: The attacker must be on the same network as the router, either connected via WiFi with the correct password or through an Ethernet connection.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `getblockschedule` function.
- The provided example request demonstrates how to trigger the overflow by sending a JSON payload with a large "notamesg" value in the data part.
- The vulnerability affects Netgear RAX30 firmware versions 1.0.11.96 and 1.0.7.78.
- Netgear released a patch in version 1.0.13.102_HOTFIX for RAX30 (and other affected routers: RAX28, RAX29).
