Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2847

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the WordPress File Upload plugin's shortcodes. Specifically, the `uploadbutton` attribute was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin failed to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a page through the shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to:
    - Malicious redirects
    - Stealing of cookies
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious actions within the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's shortcode.
- Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code via the `uploadbutton` attribute of the shortcode.
  - Example: A malicious user could set the `uploadbutton` attribute to `<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated attacker:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to create or modify posts/pages:** The attacker must be able to add or modify content that uses the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the WordPress File Upload plugin up to and including 4.24.5.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.24.6 by sanitizing the `uploadbutton` attribute input.
- The fix also addressed a bug where the RecaptchaV2 captcha was not showing when the MaterialUI theme was active.

This is a typical Stored XSS vulnerability scenario, where an attacker injects malicious code into the database (in this case, via plugin settings) that is then displayed to other users, causing the malicious code to execute in their browsers.
