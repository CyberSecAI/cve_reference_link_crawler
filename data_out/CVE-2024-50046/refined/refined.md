{
  "CVE-2024-50046": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference in the nfs42_complete_copies() function within the Linux kernel's NFSv4 implementation.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a race condition during NFSv4 server-side copy operations combined with a state recovery failure. When a destination state reclaim fails during a copy, the corresponding copy process is not properly removed from the nfs_server->ss_copies list. As a result, a source state can be processed by nfs42_complete_copies() prematurely, leading to the dereference of a stale or NULL pointer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect state management during server-side copy operations",
      "Race condition due to concurrent reclaim and copy operations",
      "Improper cleanup of copy state on destination reclaim failure",
      "NULL pointer dereference vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a system crash (kernel panic) and denial of service on the NFS client.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves performing server-side copy operations on an NFSv4 client, specifically copying files from a mountpoint of an NFS server to another location on the same server. This can trigger the state recovery failure leading to the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to perform file copy operations through an NFSv4 client mountpoint and trigger a state recovery failure on the server, which is a specific condition that would allow the exploit to succeed."
