  "CVE-2022-31043": {
    "RELATED": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to remove the `Authorization` header when redirecting from an `https` URI to an `http` URI. The Guzzle library was incorrectly forwarding sensitive `Authorization` headers during HTTP downgrades, which could lead to exposure of credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of Authorization headers during HTTP downgrades",
      "Failure to strip sensitive headers during redirects"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive authentication credentials if a request is redirected from `https` to `http`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious server could respond to an `https` request with a redirect to an `http` URI to steal authorization headers",
       "An attacker could eavesdrop on an http connection after a redirect to obtain credentials"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to set up a server that responds to an https request with an http redirect."
