## FAQ

### Are there any troubleshooting steps you’d suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you’re running the latest version of The Events Calendar. If you’re running Events Calendar PRO or any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default [Twenty Twenty](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/) theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you’ll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren’t going to say “tough luck” if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can’t guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

### I’m still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin’s [WordPress.org forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/), which we visit about once a week. Please make sure to read [our sticky post](https://evnt.is/19oc) providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you’re not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a license for Events Calendar Pro.

If you’re already an Events Calendar Pro user, you’re entitled access to our actively-monitored [Premium Support](https://evnt.is/1aju) on our website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all tickets within 24-48 hours during the business week.

### What’s the difference between The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro?

The Events Calendar is our cornerstone plugin, and it’s required in order to run any of our premium calendar add-ons, including Events Calendar Pro, Community Events, Filter Bar, and others.

In other words, Events Calendar Pro runs alongside The Events Calendar and enhances it with extra features, including recurring events, additional calendar views, calendar shortcodes, advanced widgets, custom event fields and more.

### What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar, and where can I read more about them?

The following add-ons are available for The Events Calendar:

* [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), for adding premium calendar features like recurring events, advanced views, cool widgets, [shortcodes](https://evnt.is/1ajw), additional fields, and more!
* [Event Aggregator](https://evnt.is/197u), a service that effortlessly fills your calendar with events from Meetup, Google Calendar, iCalendar, Eventbrite, CSV, and ICS.
* [Event Tickets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/) (free), which allows you to sell tickets and collect RSVPs to events. It can run alongside The Events Calendar or as a standalone plugin that adds ticket and RSVP functionality to WordPress posts and pages.
* [Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk), which allows you to sell tickets for your events using your favorite e-commerce platform.
* [Promoter](https://evnt.is/1ajt), automated email communication made just for The Events Calendar and Event Tickets. Stay in touch with your attendees every step of the way.
* [Community Events](https://evnt.is/2g), for allowing frontend event submission from your readers.
* [Filter Bar](https://evnt.is/fa), for adding advanced frontend filtering capabilities to your events calendar.
* [Eventbrite Tickets](https://evnt.is/2e), for selling tickets to your event directly through Eventbrite.

### Can I import events to my calendar?

Yes! The Events Calendar has a built-in CSV import tool. If you want to step it up and automatically import events from Google Calendar, Meetup, Eventbrite and more, check out [Event Aggregator](https://evnt.is/197u).

### How do I sell tickets to events on my calendar?

You’ll want to use our [Event Tickets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-tickets/) plugin for that. This free plugin works alongside The Events Calendar and lets you create RSVPs and tickets for events. Event Tickets integrates with PayPal so you can collect payments for tickets, while our premium solution, Event Tickets Plus fully integrates with WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads. If you want to include digital tickets like Apple Wallet passes and PDF tickets check out [Event Tickets Wallet Plus](https://evnt.is/etwp).

### Can I have more than one calendar on my site?

Unfortunately, no. However, you can use [event categories](https://evnt.is/1bay) or tags to create calendar views that only display certain events. For example, you could create a direct link to a calendar view that only shows events categorized as “Fitness,” [like this example from our demo site](https://evnt.is/1ajv).

With [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), you can use [shortcodes](https://evnt.is/1ajw) to embed your calendar on other WordPress pages and posts, then filter that calendar by category.

### Can I allow people to submit events to my calendar?

This is available with the [Community Events](https://evnt.is/2g) add-on to facilitate submissions. Install Community Events alongside The Events Calendar and a page will be added to your WordPress site with a form that visitors can use to submit events. As the calendar owner, you have full control over whether event submissions are published immediately or require moderation first.

If you want to let users sell tickets for the events they submit, check out [Community Tickets](https://evnt.is/18wl). It runs with The Events Calendar, Community Events, and Event Tickets and empowers visitors to create and sell tickets, splitting the profits with you.

### What’s the difference between The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro

The Events Calendar is our cornerstone plugin, and it’s required in order to run any of our premium calendar add-ons, including [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), [Community Events](https://evnt.is/1bax), [Filter Bar](https://evnt.is/fa), and others.

In other words, Events Calendar Pro runs alongside The Events Calendar and enhances it with extra features, including recurring events and event Series, additional calendar views, calendar shortcodes, advanced widgets, custom event fields, a duplicate event tool, and more.

I like the calendar, but the inability to hide the ‘Add To’ select button at the bottom is a BIG issue.
Comments say to add some code to the PHP file. That’s not something I want to do. A simple checkbox would be intuitive. I’m looking for another plug-in.

Operating a Wordpress site these days requires so many layers of plugins, and then with a plugin like Events Calendar there are more plugins below that (Event Tickets, Event Tickets Plus) and constant promotions for upgrades (Events Calendar Pro). All of which makes management for a part time administrator an overly complex and time consuming exercise.

We are using The Events Calendar Pro with Tickets Plus and Promoter bundle as we have an RSVP system instead of a ticket purchase.
I had a problem (critical error) activating Gravity Forms and it turns out was a server memory issue. Marta Kozak from support was outstanding and helps us isolate that on our staging site in the wp-config.php file. Once that was fixed on live, all good. 🙂
The Events to RSVP to Promoter email with unique download link now works really well.
One thing, it would be great to easily disable the “Cost: Free” wording—as our event has a cost in the description—with a checkbox as I had to use the PHP snippet from their Knowledge Base to achieve this. Maybe an update to a future version?
Thanks again!

I have used both the free and the paid version of The Events Calendar and Event Tickets. The plugins are very well made. I use the Divi theme builder and they offer a seamless interface in the theme. Best of all, I’ve had to reach out for a couple of support issues and they have been quick to respond and very accurate with their help and guidance. Great team supporting great plugins. WIN WIN!

We use the free version of Events Calendar, as our requirements are quite simple. I posted a support question and didn’t expect any response so was pleasantly surprised to get a response within a few hours! And they kept at it until the problem was solved. Can’t ask more than that! Great product, great support.
