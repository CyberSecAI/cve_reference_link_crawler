Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the encryption method used for the backup function in Cisco FXOS and UCS Manager software. Specifically, a static key is used for encryption.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the use of a static key for encrypting backup files. This makes the encryption predictable and reversible once the key is known or discovered.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt sensitive information stored in full state and configuration backup files. This includes:
    *   Local user credentials
    *   Authentication server passwords
    *   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community names
    *   Other credentials
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves an unauthenticated attacker gaining access to a backup file from a vulnerable system.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to obtain a backup file from a vulnerable Cisco FXOS or UCS Manager system. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the device itself, only to the backup file.

In summary, the vulnerability allows an attacker with access to a backup file to decrypt sensitive information due to the use of a static encryption key.
