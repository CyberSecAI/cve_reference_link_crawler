    - Viewing and modifying exam results
    - Management (insert, delete, update) student data
    - Sending fake notifications/emails to students.
- User deletion, potentially causing:
    - Data loss
    - Disruption of service for legitimate users
    - Manipulation of user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The application is a web application, thus the attack vector is through the web interface
- The exact method to bypass the access control is not specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need network access to the web application.
-  The attacker might not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability, if the access control is completely broken, but may need to have some understanding of the applications structure.
