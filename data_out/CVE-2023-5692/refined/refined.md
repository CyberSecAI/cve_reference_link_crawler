Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-5692

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `redirect_guess_404_permalink()` function in WordPress core not properly restricting the post types it searches when attempting to guess the correct URL for a 404 error. Specifically, it would consider custom post types that were not intended to be publicly queryable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The function would expose the slug of a custom post type that had its `publicly_queryable` setting set to `false`. This could allow an attacker to discover the existence of private or internal content types.
- **Incorrect 404 Redirect Handling:** The `redirect_guess_404_permalink()` function attempts to guess the intended URL when a 404 error occurs. However, it was not filtering out post types that should not be publicly accessible, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker could potentially enumerate private custom post type slugs by crafting specific URLs.
- This information could be used as a basis for further attacks or to reveal sensitive information about a site's structure and functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a URL with a misspelled post name, and a `post_type` query parameter set to a custom post type which has `publicly_queryable` set to `false`.
- The `redirect_guess_404_permalink()` function attempts to guess the intended URL, and incorrectly includes private post types in its search.
- The function would return a redirect to the actual post slug, exposing the custom post type name, even though it is not intended to be publicly accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
- They need to know or guess a post name to use in the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves limiting the post types searched by `redirect_guess_404_permalink()` to only those that are public and searchable. This is achieved by using `is_post_type_viewable()` to filter the post types.
- The patch was introduced in WordPress 6.5.
- The issue was reported by Francesco Carlucci.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium)

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to discover the slugs of private custom post types due to a flaw in how WordPress handles 404 redirects. The fix ensures that only publicly viewable post types are considered when guessing the intended URL, preventing the information exposure.
