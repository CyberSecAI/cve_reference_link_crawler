Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Discourse handles Facebook Oneboxes, specifically when processing URLs with maliciously crafted meta tags. Oneboxes are a feature that automatically embeds content from a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored DOM-based XSS. Malicious meta tags within a Facebook URL can be embedded, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization/Validation**: The system doesn't properly sanitize or validate the meta tags from the Facebook URLs before embedding them, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:**  This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive data.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the webpage.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to craft a specific URL containing malicious meta tags, which is then posted on the forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or credentials on the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the victim has to click on the posted link by the attacker.
*   **Position:** The attacker can be external and simply needs to post the malicious link on the forum.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered moderate severity with a CVSS score of 4.2
*   The vulnerability only affects sites with Content Security Policy (CSP) disabled.
*   The patch involves a change to the regex used to match facebook URLs, as well as a test.
*   The vulnerability was reported by 0xMokusou.

In summary, a stored XSS vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of Facebook Onebox content, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Javascript when users interact with maliciously crafted links. The vulnerability is fixed in newer versions of Discourse.
