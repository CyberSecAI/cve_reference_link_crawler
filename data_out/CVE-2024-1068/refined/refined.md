- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially full control of the WordPress database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious payload in the `order` parameter when accessing the logs page of the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or equivalent privileges on the WordPress site.
