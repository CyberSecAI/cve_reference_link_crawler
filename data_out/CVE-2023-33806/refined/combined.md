| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability Title: Arbitrary Code Execution on the Hikvision Interactive Tablet DS-D5B86RB/B |
|  |  |
|  | Description: |
|  | Insecure default configurations in Hikvision Interactive Tablet DS-D5B86RB/B Device Firmware version : V2.3.0 build220119 allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands. |
|  |  |
|  | VulnerabilityType: |
|  | Command Injection |
|  |  |
|  | Vendor of Product: |
|  | Hikvision |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Product Code Base: |
|  | Hikvision Interactive Tablet DS-D5B86RB/B - Device Firmware version : V2.3.0 build220119 |
|  |  |
|  | Affected Component: |
|  | Hikvision Interactive Tablet DS-D5B86RB/B |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Type: |
|  | Physical/ Remote |
|  |  |
|  | Impact Code execution: |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Vectors: |
|  | Steps to Reproduce: |
|  |  |
|  | Step 1: |
|  | Open the device setting on the Hikvision Interactive Tablet TV. |
|  | Step2: |
|  | Navigate to the About section. |
|  | Step3: |
|  | Then tap multiple times on the "Device Firmware Version" and it will open the Factory Options Menu |
|  | Step4: |
|  | Then scroll down the factory menu and click on the Execute Shell option. |
|  | Step5: |
|  | Then it will show an error "Cannot find /storage/emulated/0/\_MSTFactory folder". So try to create a folder named "\_MSTFactory" in the "/storage/emulated/0/" directory. This can be done by different methods, simple one is access the file browser, create the directory. |
|  | Step6: |
|  | After creating the directory, create a file called "MScript.sh" inside that \_MSTFactory directory. Add your reverse shell/command injection payloads inside the "MScript.sh" file. |
|  | Step7: |
|  | Then try the "Execute Shell" option again and we will get a reverse shell. |
