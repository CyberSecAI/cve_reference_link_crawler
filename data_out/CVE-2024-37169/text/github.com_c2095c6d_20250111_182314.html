## Release Notes - Security Update

* fix(security): require screenshot protocol to be http/https by [@jasonraimondi](https://github.com/jasonraimondi) in [#48](https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/pull/48)
  + Resolved a critical arbitrary file read vulnerability in the Playwright screenshot feature.
  + The vulnerability allowed attackers to read arbitrary files on the server using the `file://` URI scheme.
  + Restricted URI schemes to only allow `http` and `https` for the screenshot feature.
  + Implemented strict input validation and sanitization to ensure only allowed URIs are processed.

This release addresses a severe security issue and is highly recommended for all users. Please update to the latest version as soon as possible to protect your application and sensitive data.
