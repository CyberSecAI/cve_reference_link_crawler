prevent file:// URI scheme in Playwright screenshots

A critical vulnerability was discovered in a web application feature that utilizes
Playwright's screenshot capability. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by
using the file:// URI scheme to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem,
potentially exposing sensitive information, such as AWS credentials.

This commit addresses the vulnerability by implementing proper input validation
and sanitization to prevent the use of the file:// URI scheme in Playwright
screenshot requests, mitigating the risk of unauthorized file access.
