{
  "CVE-2021-26363": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malicious or compromised User Application (UApp) or AGESA Boot Loader (ABL) could potentially change the value that the ASP uses for its reserved DRAM.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Insufficient validation of the memory region used by the ASP (AMD Secure Processor)",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker can set the reserved DRAM region to a value outside of the intended fenced area, potentially leading to data exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": "Malicious or compromised User Application (UApp) or AGESA Boot Loader (ABL)",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious or compromised UApp or ABL, which implies some level of access to the system, either through a previously exploited vulnerability or a compromised boot process."
