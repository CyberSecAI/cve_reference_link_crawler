# XXE in eclipse IDE

## Basic information

**Project name:**
org.eclipse.pde
org.eclipse.jdt
org.eclipse.platform
org.eclipse.osgi

**Project id:** {id}

## What are the affected versions?

probably all

## Details of the issue

SonarLint reports many possible XXE attacks in eclipse IDE's sourcecode.
for example:
[![image](data:image/gif;base64...)](/-/project/3804/uploads/7cd1586ef2c1c4819e5122310501cbe7/image.png)

## Steps to reproduce

Don't know. Probably manipulating development xml-files like "build.xml", "plugin.xml", "feature.xml", ".polyglot.feature.xml", ...
which should be normally self contained and do not require access from external sources.

## Do you know any mitigations of the issue?

<https://rules.sonarsource.com/java/RSPEC-2755>
recommends to replace "SAXParserFactory.newInstance();"
with code that disables external access by properties
