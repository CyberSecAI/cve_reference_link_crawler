| Please provide an XML load option for whether or not to resolve external entities. And please disable external loading by default. It would be ok, to have a fixed set of external files precached locally like in org.eclipse.help.internal.entityresolver.LocalEntityResolver / /org.eclipse.help/dtds/internal |
