The Call-Hierarchy tells me that this method is never called. Can we then remove it?

For which one?

We should not keep internal methods for other projects, because if it is not used it can happen that one day in the future somebody comes along and cleans up this class and then that other project suddenly breaks. Everything that is not API can be removed at any time. Furthermore even a method that is not called has maintanance cost, because somebody reading this class has to understand what it is doing and then wonders who's calling it and why no code in PDE does that. In that regard no code is the best code.

And at least for the Eclipse SDK (Equinox, Platform, JDT and PDE), PDE is at the end of the dependency hierarchy, so other projects are outside the SDK? Or, since you mentioned copy-pasting, do you want to add this class to other Eclipse SDK projects as it is?

Then I suggest to add it to one at the top of the hierarchy, probably equinox or eclipse(-runtime), as an internal class, add a comment that states that this is intended to be used in the entire Eclipse-SDK (Equinox, Platform, JDT and PDE, but not more) so that one knows where to search callers.

This way the code can be re-used, but we don't have to make it an API.

I struggled to find a place that both needs this methods itself (which would make sure it is not deleted because unused and not API) and is available in all other modules as well. I would highly appreciate help to find a good place, Otherwise i would copy & paste the (small) solution to other projects and keep only the test at one module.

Part of it would be needed for example at

equinox ExtensionRegistry or org.eclipse.core.internal.resources but in at least 8 distinct git repositories. I think it's very bad to share no-API across repositories.

[@jonahgraham](https://github.com/jonahgraham) any idea?

I don't know where to put that stuff. Some of that kind of stuff lived in org.eclipse.core.runtime IIRC. But to have it at the root of the dependency tree means either A- putting it in equinox somewhere or B- making a new bundle (perhaps published to maven central)

We could also register a provider of such factories as (declarative) OSGi Service and can then query the service from any bundle in the runtime. Registering it in something like equinox.common. maybe even cascade it.

But I'm fine doing that in a later step and for now submit this as it is.

Have you checked if AssertionErrors thrown by this method are considered by JUnit for a test result, i.e. can they let the test fail? My first assumption would be that they don't.

So if they are relevant for test results, they probably should be collected and for example thrown again in the Server's close method.

Alternatively, the Server could collect only the first line it has read and provide it to the test method and the assertions could be done there. This way errors would not have to be catched, collected and re-thrown.

If the assertions are actually meaning-less, they should be removed.

Sorry, something went wrong.
