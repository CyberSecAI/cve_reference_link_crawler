### @jukzi **[jukzi](/jukzi)** commented [Jun 23, 2023](#issue-1770818662)

External entity resolution is not supported by PDE (see PDECoreMessages.XMLErrorReporter\_ExternalEntityResolution) but still the SAXParser did follow external links where DefaultHandler.resolveEntity was not overwritten.

At many places PDE already overwrote DefaultHandler.resolveEntity to prevent external resolution. With the new configuration that method is not even called anymore.

This change offers and uses a configuration that

* reports an Exception if .xml contains DOCTYPE or
* does just ignore external references (as a fall back if the exception would show up to cause trouble).

Also the caching of used parsers in possibly other threads is removed because the SAXParser is not guaranteed to be thread-safe. Only the factory is reused, because that is effectively final after creation. Reusing SAXParser is not a big help nowadays - see XmlParserFactoryTest.main(String[]) for performance test. In my measurement successive parser creations takes only ~ 0.06 ms.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Nice job on this and the other PRs regarding XML-parser creation.  Since the `XmlTransformerFactory` and `XmlDocumentBuilderFactory` class only contain one not too big method, I think it would be good to move them to the `XmlParserFactory` introduced in this change. The method names are already very expressive so I don't think it is necessary to have them in a dedicated class. |

Looks like this is always throwing an exception.

Can you tell why the test passes nevertheless?

One test expects an exception (but does not come so far because of another exception) while another test makes sure the code is not called at all.
