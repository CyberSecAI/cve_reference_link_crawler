Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2022-48991**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from missing MMU (Memory Management Unit) notifier invocations in the `khugepaged` component of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when collapsing page table entries (PTEs) in shared memory (shmem) or file-backed memory, the code didn't properly notify secondary MMUs (like KVM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-After-Free:** Secondary MMUs, such as those used by KVM, maintain mirrors of the primary MMU's page tables. They do not hold their own references to the mirrored pages. If the primary MMU removes a mapping without notifying the secondary MMU, the secondary MMU might continue to access the freed page, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Incorrect Page Table Management:** The core issue is the omission of MMU notifier calls when page table entries are removed. This was particularly problematic in the code paths that handled the collapse of page directories for Transparent Huge Pages (THP) mapped with individual page table entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Page Use-After-Free:** An attacker could potentially cause a use-after-free condition, which can lead to system instability, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Guest Escape (in virtualized environments):** In KVM-based virtualized environments, this could allow a malicious guest to escape the confines of the VM and potentially compromise the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `khugepaged` daemon, which is responsible for collapsing page tables to create huge pages.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code paths are within the `collapse_pte_mapped_thp` and `retract_page_tables` functions of the `mm/khugepaged.c` file. These functions are invoked when collapsing page table entries in shmem or file backed memory
- The vulnerable code is reachable by performing operations that trigger the collapse of page tables like allocating memory in shared memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `khugepaged` daemon to collapse page tables in shared or file backed memory and have a secondary MMU in place.
- In the case of a virtualized environment like KVM, this means the attacker would need to control a guest OS that can trigger the vulnerable code path.
- It is likely this bug can be triggered from within a container, but further verification would be needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was introduced in commit `f3f0e1d2150b` ("khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages") but the most impactful omission of MMU notifiers came in commit `27e1f8273113` ("khugepaged: enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP").
- The fix involves adding MMU notifier calls at the start and end of critical sections where PTEs are being removed, ensuring that secondary MMUs are made aware of changes to the mappings.

**Patches:**
The provided diffs show the fixes being applied across different kernel versions with slightly varying implementations due to API changes, specifically:
- `f268f6cf875f3220afc77bdd0bf1bb136eb54db9`: Original patch to address the issue.
- `ff2a1a6f869650aec99e9d070b5ab625bfbc5bc3`: Backport for older kernels where the code was refactored into a common helper between 5.15 and 6.0,
- `275c626c131cfe141beeb6c575e31fa53d32da19`: Another backport with manual adaptations for older kernel versions,
- `c23105673228c349739e958fa33955ed8faddcaf`: Another backport with manual adaptations for older kernel versions
- `5ffc2a75534d9d74d49760f983f8eb675fa63d69`: Another backport for kernels where code was refactored.
- `7f445ca2e0e59c7971d0b7b853465e50844ab596`: Another backport for kernels where code was refactored.
- `5450535901d89a5dcca5fbbc59a24fe89caeb465`: Backport that is simpler as no changes were needed.
- `1a3f8c6cd29d9078cc81b29d39d0e9ae1d6a03c3`: Another backport for kernels where code was refactored.

The patches focus on adding calls to `mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start` before removing the page table, and `mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end` after removing the page table. These functions ensure that all MMUs are notified of the change.

In summary, CVE-2022-48991 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `khugepaged` component due to missing MMU notifier calls during page table collapses. This vulnerability could lead to serious security implications, including potential guest escapes in virtualized environments.
