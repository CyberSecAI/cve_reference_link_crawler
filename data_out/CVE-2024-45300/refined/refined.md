{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the application's promo code usage validation logic. Specifically, the check to ensure the promo code hasn't exceeded its maximum usage limit isn't atomic, leading to multiple concurrent requests bypassing the limit.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Race condition: The application checks the promo code usage and then applies the discount without proper synchronization, allowing concurrent requests to pass the limit.",
    "Non-atomic operations: The operations of checking the promo code count and updating the usage count aren't performed atomically.",
    "Lack of proper locking mechanisms: The application fails to use database-level locking to prevent concurrent modifications to the promo code usage counter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can repeatedly use a promo code beyond its intended limit, leading to financial losses for the application's operators. The impact is considered high as it disrupts the intended functionality and can cause significant financial damage.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. Multiple concurrent requests are made to the server to exploit the race condition. This could be done by a single user or multiple users simultaneously.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make concurrent requests to the application's server to exploit the race condition. No specific privileges are required, an attacker only needs to be an authenticated user of the system. The attacker does not need physical access to the server; it can be done remotely."
