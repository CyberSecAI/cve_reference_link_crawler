Package        : mediawiki
Version        : 1:1.31.16-1+deb10u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2023-3550 CVE-2023-45362 CVE-2023-45363

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in mediawiki, a website engine for
collaborative work, that could lead to information disclosure, privilege
escalation, or denial of service.

CVE-2023-3550

    Carlos Bello reported a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
    vulnerability when uploading crafted XML file to Special:Upload,
    which can lead to privilege escalation.  (However .xml file uploads
    are not allowed in the default configuration.)

CVE-2023-45362

    Tobias Frei discovered that diff-multi-sameuser (‚ÄúX intermediate
    revisions by the same user not shown‚Äù) ignores username suppression,
    which can lead to information leak.

CVE-2023-45363

    It was discovered that querying pages redirected to other variants
    with `redirects` and `converttitles` parameters set would cause
    a denial of service (unbounded loop and RequestTimeoutException).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.31.16-1+deb10u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.
