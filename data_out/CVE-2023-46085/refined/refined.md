- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Wp Ultimate Review Plugin <= 2.3.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while they are authenticated. The specific impact depends on the actions available in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through CSRF, where a malicious actor tricks an authenticated user into making unintended requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) into submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin.
