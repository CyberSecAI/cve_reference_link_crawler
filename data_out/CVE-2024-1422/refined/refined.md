- Root cause of vulnerability: The Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress fails to sanitize user-supplied attributes in the modal popup widget's effect setting, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is present in the modal popup widget's effect setting.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with contributor-level or higher permissions.
