**CVE-2023-44848**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `admin_template.php` component of SeaCMS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the deletion of arbitrary files, including important ones, resulting in information disclosure and loss of critical data and functionality.
