- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a post-authentication remote code execution (RCE) issue present in the CLI command processing of certain Zyxel firewall versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via the CLI of the firewall after authentication, meaning the attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the affected firewall to exploit the vulnerability. The device's WAN access is disabled by default, suggesting that the attacker must have network access to the firewall's LAN or management interface.
