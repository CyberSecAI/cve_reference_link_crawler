- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection').
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Injection vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to various attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where attackers can execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in work flow management within Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM). The attack is performed remotely. The exact vectors are unspecified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a remote, authenticated user. The attacker also needs to trick a victim into interacting with the injected content, since user interaction (UI) is required.
