- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate locally created trusted sessions after a reboot of the affected device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization or authentication mechanism that allows bypassing secondary authentication. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle trusted sessions after reboot.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with primary user credentials could bypass secondary authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected Windows device, thereby compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have primary user credentials and physical access to the affected device.
