Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5724

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of user-supplied input within the `Photo Video Gallery Master` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin deserializes the `PVGM_all_photos_details` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection due to the deserialization of untrusted data. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application.
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `PVGM_all_photos_details` parameter before deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** If a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain is present, either within the plugin itself, or through other installed plugins or themes, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Successful exploitation might lead to the deletion of arbitrary files on the server's file system.
- **Sensitive Data Retrieval:** The vulnerability could also be leveraged to retrieve sensitive data from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `PVGM_all_photos_details` parameter. This parameter is part of a request made to the WordPress plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious request to the WordPress site.
- **POP Chain:** The attacker needs a suitable POP chain to trigger a desired malicious action, which may be present in the plugin itself or another installed plugin/theme.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content explicitly states that "No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software." This means that successful exploitation relies on the presence of a POP chain elsewhere on the target system (another plugin/theme).
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.5.3.
- There is no known patch available at the time of this analysis, and it is recommended to uninstall the plugin as a mitigation strategy.
