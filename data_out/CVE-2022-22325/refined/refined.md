- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A queue manager trace may disclose a plaintext password flowing over an MQ channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (plaintext password).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access or control of systems or data.
- **Attack vectors**: Through queue manager traces.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with access to queue manager trace logs can potentially obtain plaintext passwords used by the MQ channel.
