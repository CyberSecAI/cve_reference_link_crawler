Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of restrictions on file uploads in the `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings` endpoint of the Simple Online Bidding System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type or content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload malicious scripts (e.g., PHP files) to the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The uploaded malicious scripts can be used to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from the server, including database information.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is included in the form data with the `img` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit doesn't seem to require any authentication, implying that any user with network access can exploit this.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/ajax.php?action=save_settings`.
*   The attacker uploads a PHP file named `1.php` with the following content: `<?php phpinfo();?>`.
*   The file is uploaded to `/simple-online-bidding-system/admin/assets/uploads/`.
*   The filename is generated dynamically, prepended by a timestamp (`1719140880\_1.php` in the example).

**Additional Notes**

* The provided information includes a full HTTP request that can be used as a Proof of Concept.
* The github link provides more details about the vulnerability than the VulDB description.
