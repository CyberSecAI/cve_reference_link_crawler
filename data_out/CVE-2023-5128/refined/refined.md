Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The TCD Google Maps plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the `map` shortcode and does not escape output, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows arbitrary web scripts to be injected through the `map` shortcode attributes, due to a lack of input sanitization and output escaping.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in the output.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to encode or escape user-controlled data when rendering HTML, allowing injected scripts to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- This script executes when a user visits the page, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker leverages the `map` shortcode within the WordPress content.
- **Malicious Attributes:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code as values in the shortcode's attributes, such as `style`, `class`, and `address`.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected payload is stored in the database and is executed each time the affected page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level or higher permissions to create or modify content that includes the malicious shortcode.
- **WordPress Access:** The attacker must have access to the WordPress administration panel to add or edit content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the TCD Google Maps plugin up to and including 1.8.
- There is no known patch available for the vulnerability.
- The `style` attribute of the map shortcode is one of the vectors for the vulnerability.
- The `address` attribute within the `geocoder.geocode` function is also vulnerable.
