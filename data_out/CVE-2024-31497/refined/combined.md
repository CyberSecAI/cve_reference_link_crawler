| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2275183#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-04-15 21:22:04 UTC  ``` In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. One scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. Because SSH is sometimes used to authenticate to Git services, it is possible that this vulnerability could be leveraged for supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. It is also conceivable that signed messages from PuTTY or Pageant are readable by adversaries more easily in other scenarios, but none have yet been disclosed.  ### Affected Products  - PuTTY 0.68 - 0.80  The following (not necessarily complete) list of products bundle an  affected PuTTY version and are therefore vulnerable as well:  - FileZilla 3.24.1 - 3.66.5 - WinSCP 5.9.5 - 6.3.2 - TortoiseGit 2.4.0.2 - 2.15.0 - TortoiseSVN 1.10.0 - 1.14.6  ### Impact  The nonce bias allows for full secret key recovery of NIST P-521 keys  after a malicious actor has seen roughly 60 valid ECDSA signatures  generated by any PuTTY component under the same key. Luckily, client  signatures are transmitted within the secure channel of SSH, requiring a  malicious server to acquire such signatures. If the key has been used to  sign arbitrary data (e.g., git commits by forwarding Pageant to a  development host), the publicly available signatures (e.g., on GitHub)  can be used as well.  All NIST P-521 client keys used with PuTTY must be considered  compromised, given that the attack can be carried out even after the  root cause has been fixed in the source code (assuming that ~60  pre-patch signatures are available to an adversary).  ### Mitigations  This vulnerability has been fixed in PuTTY 0.81, FileZilla 3.67.0,  WinSCP 6.3.3, and TortoiseGit 2.15.0.1. Users of TortoiseSVN are advised  to configure TortoiseSVN to use Plink from the latest PuTTY 0.81 release  when accessing a SVN repository via SSH until a patch becomes available.  ECDSA NIST-P521 keys used with any vulnerable product / component should  be considered compromised and consequently revoked by removing them from  authorized_keys, GitHub, ...

# CVE-2024-31497

| **Name** | CVE-2024-31497 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. The required set of signed messages may be publicly readable because they are stored in a public Git service that supports use of SSH for commit signing, and the signatures were made by Pageant through an agent-forwarding mechanism. In other words, an adversary may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY versions. After a key compromise, an adversary may be able to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. A second, independent scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6. |

# BreakingECDSAwithLLL

Breaking ECDSA (not so broken) with LLL

The main idea behing this attack is the theorem of the great numbers, if you have a crypto funcion and lots of samples (signatures) generated with a private key having a bias in the nonce generation, then they will tend to converge to a single point which happens to be the private key, this is equal to solving the hidden number problem.
And for solving it we employ Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz lattice reduction algorithm.

The main counter measure against this kind of attack is using deterministic signatures like Z=H(h||d), where Z is the digest, H is a crypto-secure hash funcion, h the nonce, and d our private key. This is needed in order to have a even distributed, random looking nonce.

Heavily based on previous work

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ssTlSSIJQE

```

First install dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install sagemath python3-ecdsa

```

Then run:

```
# (Victim)
# This will generate 6 weak signatures with a known key, args:(privkey,bits,nonces)
python3 weak_signature_generator.py e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 176 6 > nonces.csv

# (Attacker)
# Will find the private key if LLL converges, args:(bits,nonces)

## PoC video

## Summary

PuTTY versions 0.68 through 0.80 (prior to 0.81) have a flaw in biased ECDSA nonce generation, allowing attackers to quickly recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key in about 60 signatures. If attackers can read signed messages by PuTTY or Pageant, they may compromise a victim's private key, enabling supply-chain attacks on Git-hosted software. Similarly, if an adversary operates an SSH server where the victim uses the same private key for other services, the adversary can derive the key and gain unauthorized access. This vulnerability also affects FileZilla, WinSCP, TortoiseGit, and TortoiseSVN.

# CVE-2024-31497: Critical PuTTY Vulnerability Exposes Private Keys – Immediate Action Required

[do son](https://securityonline.info/author/ddos/)
April 15, 2024![PuTTY CVE-2024-31497 vulnerability](data:image/svg+xml...)

A severe security flaw (**CVE-2024-31497**) has been discovered in the popular SSH client [PuTTY](https://securityonline.info/hackers-target-system-admins-with-fake-putty-website-deploy-rhadamanthys-stealer/) (versions 0.68 to 0.80), impacting a wide range of software including FileZilla, WinSCP, TortoiseGit, and TortoiseSVN. This defect drastically weakens private keys used in the ECDSA algorithm with the NIST P-521 curve, leaving them easily recoverable by attackers. This flaw was discovered by security researchers Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann from Ruhr University Bochum.

![PuTTY CVE-2024-31497 vulnerability](data:image/svg+xml...)

**The Problem**

The **CVE-2024-31497** vulnerability [lies](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6) in how PuTTY generates random values (nonces) used within the ECDSA signature process. In the NIST P-251 configuration, the randomness is heavily biased. Attackers can exploit this bias to reconstruct the private key after collecting just 60 or so signatures created with the compromised key.

**Who’s at Risk**

Anyone who uses the [affected](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-p521-bias.html) versions of PuTTY or related products like Filezilla for SSH authentication with ECDSA NIST P-521 keys is vulnerable. Attackers can obtain the necessary signatures by briefly compromising an SSH server you connect to or potentially from public sources where you’ve used the key (like signed Git commits).

This vulnerability not only affects users of PuTTY but also extends to several other tools:

* FileZilla (Versions 3.24.1 – 3.66.5)* WinSCP (Versions 5.9.5 – 6.3.2)* TortoiseGit (Versions 2.4.0.2 – 2.15.0)* TortoiseSVN (Versions 1.10.0 – 1.14.6)

**The Consequences**

A compromised private key is disastrous. Attackers can impersonate you, potentially gaining access to any server where you use that key for authentication. The damage persists even after the vulnerability is patched – previously exposed keys are permanently compromised.

**What You Must Do**

1. **Identify Vulnerable Keys:** Check if you use ECDSA NIST P-521 keys. In PuTTYgen, the fingerprint starts with “ecdsa-sha2-nistp521”.- **Revoke Compromised Keys:** Remove compromised public keys from all `authorized_keys` files on servers and any online service where they’re used (like GitHub).- **Generate New Keys:** Create fresh key pairs (ideally using Ed25519, which is unaffected) to replace the compromised ones.- **Update Your Software:** Immediately update PuTTY to version [0.81](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or later. Do the same for FileZilla (version 3.67.0), WinSCP (version 6.3.3), TortoiseGit (version 2.15.0.1), and TortoiseSVN. If you can’t update TortoiseSVN, switch to using the updated PuTTY Plink for SSH connections.

**Additional Notes**

* This flaw does NOT expose signatures through passive network snooping. An attacker needs active control of a server or access to your signed data.* Other ECDSA key sizes show slight bias but are not practically exploitable at this time.

Package        : putty
Version        : 0.74-1+deb11u1~deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-31497

A biased ECDSA nonce generation allowed an attacker
to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in
approximately 60 signatures. In other words, an adversary
may already have enough signature information to compromise a victim's
private key, even if there is no further use of vulnerable PuTTY
versions.

This allowed an attacker to (for instance) log in to any servers
the victim uses that key for.

To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly compromise
any server the victim uses the key to authenticate to.

Therefore, if you have any NIST-P521 ECDSA key, we strongly recommend
you to replace it with a freshly new created with a fixed version of
putty. Then, to revoke the old public key and remove it from any
machine where you use it to login into, so that a signature
from the compromised key has no value any more.

The only affected key type is 521-bit ECDSA. That is, a key that appears
in Windows PuTTYgen with ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 at the start of the
'Key fingerprint' box, or is described as 'NIST p521', or has an id
starting ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 in the SSH protocol or the key file.
Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key algorithms, are unaffected.
In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.74-1+deb11u1~deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your putty packages.

A vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-31497 in PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 could potentially allow attackers with access to 60 cryptographic signatures to recover the private key used for their generation.

PuTTY is a popular open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application that supports SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

System administrators and developers predominantly use the software to remotely access and manage servers and other networked devices over SSH from a Windows-based client.

The vulnerability tracked as [CVE-2024-31497](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31497) was discovered by [Fabian Bäumer and Marcus Brinkmann](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6) of the Ruhr University Bochum and is caused by how PuTTY generates ECDSA nonces (temporary unique cryptographic numbers) for the NIST P-521 curve used for SSH authentication.

Specifically, there's a bias due to PuTYY's use of a deterministic way to generate these numbers to compensate for the lack of a robust cryptographic random number generator on specific Windows versions.

> "PuTTY's technique worked by making a SHA-512 hash and then reducing it mod q, where q is the order of the group used in the DSA system. For integer DSA (for which PuTTY's technique was originally developed), q is about 160 bits; for elliptic-curve DSA (which came later), it has about the same number of bits as the curve modulus, so 256 or 384 or 521 bits for the NIST curves."
>
> "In all of those cases except P521, the bias introduced by reducing a 512-bit number mod q is negligible. But in the case of P521, where q has 521 bits (i.e. more than 512), reducing a 512-bit number mod q has no effect at all – you get a value of k whose top 9 bits are always zero." - [PuTTY security advisory.](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-p521-bias.html)

The main repercussion of recovering the private key is that it allows unauthorized access to SSH servers or sign commits as the developer, potentially even achieving supply chain attacks on impacted software projects.

## Exploiting CVE-2024-31497

A digital signature is created using a user's private key and verified by the corresponding public key on the server, ensuring the user's identity and the communication's security.

Brinkmann explained on X that attackers require 58 signatures to calculate a target's private key, which they can acquire either by collecting them from logins to an SSH server they control or is compromised, or from signed Git commits.

Collecting signatures from an SSH server is not as critical as it would mean the server itself is already compromised, and thus, the threat actor has broad access to the operating system.

However, Bäumer told BleepingComputer that the second method of harvesting signatures from public commits is far more practical for attackers.

There are instances where this vulnerability can be exploited without the need to compromise a server in advance.

One such case is the use of SSH keys for signing Git commits. A common setup involves using Pageant, the ssh-agent of PuTTY, locally and forwarding the agent to a development host.

Here, you configure Git to use OpenSSH to sign Git commits with the SSH key provided by Pageant. The signature is then generated by Pageant, making it susceptible to private key recovery.

This is particularly concerning as git signatures may be publicly accessible, for example, if the commit is pushed to a public repository on GitHub.

❖ Fabian Bäumer

## Flaw fixed, other software impacted

The developers fixed the vulnerability in PuTTY version 0.81, which abandons the previous k-generation method and switches to the RFC 6979 technique for all DSA and ECDSA keys.

However, it is noted that any P521 private keys generated using the vulnerable version of the tool should be considered unsafe and replaced by new, secure keys.

The following software that uses the vulnerable PuTTY is confirmed as impacted:

* FileZilla 3.24.1 – 3.66.5 (fixed in 3.67.0)
* WinSCP 5.9.5 – 6.3.2 (fixed in 6.3.3)
* TortoiseGit 2.4.0.2 – 2.15.0 (fixed in 2.15.0.1)
* TortoiseSVN 1.10.0 – 1.14.6 (mitigation possible by configuring TortoiseSVN to use Plink from the latest PuTTY 0.81 release)

There are likely more software tools impacted by CVE-2024-31497, depending on which PuTTY version they incorporate. Therefore, users are advised to check their tools and take preventive action as needed.

## Description

In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. One scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. Because SSH is sometimes used to authenticate to Git services, it is possible that this vulnerability could be leveraged for supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. It is also conceivable that signed messages from PuTTY or Pageant are readable by adversaries more easily in other scenarios, but none have yet been disclosed.

Switch to RFC 6979 for DSA nonce generation.

This fixes a vulnerability that compromises NIST P521 ECDSA keys when

they are used with PuTTY's existing DSA nonce generation code. The

vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CVE-2024-31497.

PuTTY has been doing its DSA signing deterministically for literally

as long as it's been doing it at all, because I didn't trust Windows's

entropy generation. Deterministic nonce generation was introduced in

commit [d345ebc2a5a0b59](/?p=simon/putty.git;a=object;h=d345ebc2a5a0b59), as part of the initial version of our DSA

signing routine. At the time, there was no standard for how to do it,

so we had to think up the details of our system ourselves, with some

help from the Cambridge University computer security group.

More than ten years later, RFC 6979 was published, recommending a

similar system for general use, naturally with all the details

different. We didn't switch over to doing it that way, because we had

a scheme in place already, and as far as I could see, the differences

were not security-critical - just the normal sort of variation you

expect when any two people design a protocol component of this kind

independently.

As far as I know, the \_structure\_ of our scheme is still perfectly

fine, in terms of what data gets hashed, how many times, and how the

hash output is converted into a nonce. But the weak spot is the choice

of hash function: inside our dsa\_gen\_k() function, we generate 512

bits of random data using SHA-512, and then reduce that to the output

range by modular reduction, regardless of what signature algorithm

we're generating a nonce for.

In the original use case, this introduced a theoretical bias (the

output size is an odd prime, which doesn't evenly divide the space of

2^512 possible inputs to the reduction), but the theory was that since

integer DSA uses a modulus prime only 160 bits long (being based on

SHA-1, at least in the form that SSH uses it), the bias would be too

small to be detectable, let alone exploitable.

Then we reused the same function for NIST-style ECDSA, when it

arrived. This is fine for the P256 curve, and even P384. But in P521,

the order of the base point is \_greater\_ than 2^512, so when we

generate a 512-bit number and reduce it, the reduction never makes any

difference, and our output nonces are all in the first 2^512 elements

of the range of about 2^521. So this \_does\_ introduce a significant

bias in the nonces, compared to the ideal of uniformly random

distribution over the whole range. And it's been recently discovered

that a bias of this kind is sufficient to expose private keys, given a

manageably small number of signatures to work from.

(Incidentally, none of this affects [Ed25519](/?p=simon/putty.git;a=object;h=Ed25519). The spec for that system

includes its own idea of how you should do deterministic nonce

generation - completely different again, naturally - and we did it

that way rather than our way, so that we could use the existing test

vectors.)

The simplest fix would be to patch our existing nonce generator to use

a longer hash, or concatenate a couple of SHA-512 hashes, or something

similar. But I think a more robust approach is to switch it out

completely for what is now the standard system. The main reason why I

prefer that is that the standard system comes with test vectors, which

adds a lot of confidence that I haven't made some other mistake in

following my own design.

So here's a commit that adds an implementation of RFC 6979, and

removes the old dsa\_gen\_k() function. Tests are added based on the

RFC's appendix of test vectors (as many as are compatible with the

more limited API of PuTTY's crypto code, e.g. we lack support for the

NIST P192 curve, or for doing integer DSA with many different hash

functions). One existing test changes its expected outputs, namely the

one that has a sample key pair and signature for every key algorithm

we support.

The problem here is the distinction between an n-bit random number and n-bit modulus. In DSA, if you're working with a 521-bit modulus, and you need a random k value for it, k needs to be random across all 521-bits. Systems programming intuition tells you that a 512-bit random number is, to within mind-boggling tolerances, as unguessable as a 521-bit random number. But that's not the point. A 512 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, which are legible to cryptanalysis as bias. In the DSA/ECDSA equation, this reduces through linear algebra to the Hidden Number Problem, solvable over some number of sample signatures for the private key using CVP. *Later* Here you go, from Sean Devlin's Cryptopals Set 8: <https://cryptopals.com/sets/8/challenges/62.txt> | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [rainsford](user?id=rainsford) [9 months ago](item?id=40045950)   | [parent](#40045377) | [next](#40046132) [–]  What's really interesting to me is that there was a known solution to the DSA/ECDSA nonce generation problem, RFC 6979, which was published 4 years before the vulnerability was introduced into PuTTY. And it sounds like the developer knew about this RFC at the time but didn't implement it because the much earlier version of deterministic nonce generation that PuTTY already had seemed similar enough and the differences were assessed to not be security critical. So I think the other lesson here is that deviating from a cryptographic right answer is a major footgun unless you understand *exactly* why the recommendation works the way it does and *exactly* what the implications are of you doing it differently. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akerl\_](user?id=akerl_) [9 months ago](item?id=40046192)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40045950) | [next](#40046012) [–]  The article addresses this: they wrote this code path in 2001.

Doing so prior to the elliptic curve support being added would have completely avoided this vulnerability. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hobbified](user?id=hobbified) [9 months ago](item?id=40052508)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046270) | [next](#40046012) [–]  In a parallel universe, they switched to RFC6979 in 2013, but the implementation had a bug that wasn't detected for years, allowing compromise of lots of keys. In that parallel universe, HN is criticizing them for following fashion instead of just leaving an already-proven piece of crypto code in place. It's an unfortunate bug, an unfortunate oversight, but I think they made a perfectly reasonable choice at the time. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [9 months ago](item?id=40046012)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40045950) | [prev](#40046192) | [next](#40046132) [–]  I think 6979 is a bit of a red herring here. 6979 is about deterministic nonce generation, which is what you do to dodge the problem of having an insecure RNG. But the problem here isn't that the RNG is secure; it's more fundamentally a problem of not understanding what the rules of the nonce are. But I may be hair-splitting. Like, yeah, they freelanced their own *deterministic* nonce generation. Either way, I think this code long predates 6979. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rainsford](user?id=rainsford) [9 months ago](item?id=40046235)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046012) | [next](#40046132) [–]  I was going based off the commit link posted further down the thread ([https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...](https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c193fe9848f50a88a4089aac647fecc31ae96d27)). You're right that the PuTTY deterministic nonce generating code does appear to significantly predate the RFC, but it sounds like the developer made a conscious decision when 6979 came out not to switch from what PuTTY already had because they looked similar enough. The PuTTY release that introduced support for elliptic curve cryptography (and introduced this vulnerability) was 0.68, which came out in 2017, 4 years after the RFC. You're right that this was not an RNG security problem and instead was a problem with not understanding ECDSA nonce rules. However the notable fact for me was that the developer was apparently aware of the recommended way to deterministically generate nonces prior to the vulnerability being introduced and made a choice not to implement the RFC because what PuTTY was already doing seemed close enough, without fully understanding the implications of doing so. To put it another way, understanding ECDSA nonce rules would have avoided this vulnerability, but so too would implementing the RFC recommended way even if the developer did not fully understand why it was better than the existing implementation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [9 months ago](item?id=40046289)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046235) | [next](#40046132) [–]  Right, the reason I'm splitting hairs is that in my intuition, the whole rationale for 6979 is to eliminate the possibility of *fully repeated nonces*, for instance because your RNG is "unseeded". You can still end up with a biased nonce even if you're using a perfectly seeded random bit generator (as you can see here). But yeah I think we understand each other. As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kwantam](user?id=kwantam) [9 months ago](item?id=40046434)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046289) | [next](#40046453) [–]  RFC6979 attempts to guarantee that the nonce is unbiased (under the assumption that HMAC's output is indistinguishable from random). It's definitely attempting to give a stronger property than simply preventing a repeated nonce. See step (h) in Section 3.2. The nonce is selected by rejection sampling. Thus, under the above assumption about HMAC, the result is indistinguishable from uniformly random in the [1, q-1] range. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rainsford](user?id=rainsford) [9 months ago](item?id=40046453)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046289) | [prev](#40046434) | [next](#40046132) [–]  > As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all. I agree! DSA nonce issues are a great class of cryptographic bug in that they're sort of weirdly unexpected failure properties when you first hear about it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nmadden](user?id=nmadden) [9 months ago](item?id=40049079)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046453) | [next](#40046132) [–]  And then you find out about special soundness and that this is not only expected behaviour, but crucial to the security definitions and you realise that signatures are absolutely cursed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [garaetjjte](user?id=garaetjjte) [9 months ago](item?id=40046132)   | [parent](#40045377) | [prev](#40045950) | [next](#40048841) [–]  I don't think anybody consciously looked at 9 zero bits and thought *this is fine*, but it rather looks like unfortunate effect of plugging old code into new algorithms without proper verification. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rainsford](user?id=rainsford) [9 months ago](item?id=40046377)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046132) | [next](#40048841) [–]  You could be right. If you look at the old code, dsa\_gen\_k(), that was removed during the commit ([https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...](https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c193fe9848f50a88a4089aac647fecc31ae96d27)), it does basically no bounds checking, presumably because at the time it was written it was assumed that all modulus values would be many fewer bits than the size of a SHA-512 output. So it would have been pretty easy to just reuse the function for a modulus value that was too big without encountering any errors. And the old code was written 15+ years before it was used for P-521, so it's entirely possible the developer forgot the limitations of the dsa\_gen\_k() function. So maybe there's another lesson here about bounds checking inputs and outputs even if they don't apply to anything you're currently doing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [throwaway984393](user?id=throwaway984393) [9 months ago](item?id=40048004)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40046377) | [next](#40048841) [–]  I mean, bounds checking should really be caught by complete test coverage, shouldn't it? Or fuzzing? It doesn't address the more fundamental problem of cryptanalysis attacks, but it would definitely help mitigate the simple mistakes which can lead to exploitable implementations. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kijin](user?id=kijin) [9 months ago](item?id=40048841)   | [parent](#40045377) | [prev](#40046132) | [next](#40047476) [–]  The very existence of 521-bit ECDSA is a footgun just waiting to go off. To any programmer who is accustomed to thinking in binary but hasn't heard the full story about why it ended up being such an odd number, 521 is virtually indistinguishable at a glance from the nice round number that is 512. Heck, when I first read about it, I thought it was a typo! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rainsford](user?id=rainsford) [9 months ago](item?id=40050978)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40048841) | [next](#40049828) [–]  The size is unexpected, but I believe this would have been an issue even if it really was 512-bit ECDSA rather than 521. Taking a random 512-bit number, which is what the PuTTY nonce function produced, and taking it modulo another 512-bit number, would also bias the output. Not as severely as having 9 bits that are always zero, but enough to be potentially exploitable anyways. To avoid this issue, you either want your random value to be significantly larger than the modulus (which is what EDDSA does) or you want to generate random values of the right number of bits until one happens to be smaller than the modulus (which is what RFC 6979 does). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GoblinSlayer](user?id=GoblinSlayer) [9 months ago](item?id=40049828)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40048841) | [prev](#40050978) | [next](#40054234) [–]  There are many footguns in ECDSA, it's an old algorithm created to exist, instead use an algorithm designed to be safe, like ed25519. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chasil](user?id=chasil) [9 months ago](item?id=40054234)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40048841) | [prev](#40049828) | [next](#40047476) [–]  The number in question is actually: ```   $ bc   bc 1.07.1   Copyright 1991-1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012-2017 Free    Software Foundation, Inc.

It's the difference between a 512-bit random number and a 521-bit random number. It's very simple, but wording it as number vs. modulus is needlessly confusing, just adding to the problem you are bemoaning. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tankenmate](user?id=tankenmate) [9 months ago](item?id=40049856)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40048650) | [next](#40049989) [–]  The issue with cryptography is that you have to be precise, that means the communication needs to involve far more detail, even if it can initially be confusing. This is one of the major reasons that crypto is hard and if you try to get around the "hard" bit your "shortcut" will probably come back to bite you. When it comes to crypto and accuracy (and hence security), more communication, and detailed communication are probably the solution not the problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acer4666](user?id=acer4666) [9 months ago](item?id=40054025)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40049856) | [next](#40049989) [–]  Agreed; my problem was that the parent comment was imprecise, and hence confusing. "n bit random number vs. n bit modulus" implied n was the same in each case, whereas 521 is not the same as 512. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [taspeotis](user?id=taspeotis) [9 months ago](item?id=40049989)   | [parent](#40045377) | [prev](#40048650) | [next](#40050133) [–]  I feel like there should be some intuition like a cable rated for 100kg is not suitable for holding 110kg, therefore 512 bits of entropy is not rated to be 521 bits of entropy? Oh well, there’s this very popular library which generates 256-bit keys setting the last 128 bits to a value derived from the first 128 bits. So I guess in agreement with your post: actually achieving full entropy is not obvious.

This is like if you bought prestressed concrete rated for 100kg and you loaded it with 50kg. This is less than the limit, so it’s good right? Nope, the way it works is that you have to give it exactly 100kg of load or else it’s weak to tension and your building falls over in the wind. The problem here is that not that they needed 521 bits of entropy and 512 was too little but that 521 bits of entropy of which 512 are legit and *the top 9 bits are all zeroes* breaks the algorithm completely and makes it not secure at all. In fact I think copying 9 bits from the other 512, while not great, would have probably made this basically not a problem.

Clear, actionable, concise. If you have a bit of instinct for this, it feels obvious that 'reducing' a smaller number by a larger one is not going to obscure the smaller 1 in any meaningful way, and instead it will leave it completely unchanged. I don't think this is so much what you make it out to be, but a poor understanding of basic discrete maths (also I think you mean the 521 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, the modulus normally refers to the divisor not the remainder) <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Modulus.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [darby\_eight](user?id=darby_eight) [9 months ago](item?id=40047287)   | [parent](#40045377) | [prev](#40050133) | [next](#40046382) [–]  Tf is a zero bit and how is it distinct from a zero bit? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dspillett](user?id=dspillett) [9 months ago](item?id=40049988)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40047287) | [next](#40047343) [–]  Here it is the difference between a bit that is part of a cryptographically-safe random number and just happens to be zero, but had equal chance of being one, and a bit that is zero every time because of the way the numbers are being generated. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Retr0id](user?id=Retr0id) [9 months ago](item?id=40047343)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40047287) | [prev](#40049988) | [next](#40049039) [–]  I'm not quite sure what you're asking here but note that 521 != 512, and the former is not a typo. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cozzyd](user?id=cozzyd) [9 months ago](item?id=40048607)   | [root](#40045377) | [parent](#40047343) | [next](#40049039) [–]  Plot twist: The choice of 521 is adversarial specifically to exploit PuTTY without being easily noticed.

The issue is with ECDSA: *any* use of ECDSA with biased nonce generation, regardless of the elliptic curve it's implemented over, immediately causes secret key leakage. (Rant: All these years later, we're all still doing penance for the fact that Schnorr signatures were patented and so everyone used ECDSA instead. It's an absolute garbage fire of a signature scheme and should be abandoned yesterday for many reasons, e.g., no real proof of security, terrible footguns like this.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [djao](user?id=djao) [9 months ago](item?id=40047887)   | [root](#40045090) | [parent](#40046277) | [next](#40049680) [–]  Schnorr wouldn't have helped in this specific case, since Schnorr is equally vulnerable to biased nonces (<https://ecc2017.cs.ru.nl/slides/ecc2017-tibouchi.pdf>). EdDSA, which is essentially deterministic Schnorr, does solve the problem. Also, the use of P-521 didn't specifically cause the vulnerability, but the bad interaction between SHA512 and P-521 did play a role. It is unfortunate that nature conspired against us to make 2^511 - 1 a composite number. The fact that you have to go up to 521 bits to get a Mersenne prime whereas the natural target length for a hash output is 512 bits is the fatal interaction here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kwantam](user?id=kwantam) [9 months ago](item?id=40048301)   | [root](#40045090) | [parent](#40047887) | [next](#40049937) [–]  Excellent points all around, and thank you for the pointer to the ECC slides :) (And indeed, nature could have been kinder to us and given us a Mersenne between 127 and 521...) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [GoblinSlayer](user?id=GoblinSlayer) [9 months ago](item?id=40049937)   | [root](#40045090) | [parent](#40047887) | [prev](#40048301) | [next](#40049680) [–]  Shouldn't there be another close enough prime?

On the one side Windows Terminal does a lot of the classic VT\* terminal emulation that old ConHost did not. On the other side Windows ships "real" OpenSSH now as a feature that turns on automatically with Windows "Dev Mode". No built in GUI for the SSH agent, but at this point if you are familiar with SSH then using a CLI SSH agent shouldn't be scary. If you are "upgrading" from PuTTY you just need to export your keys to a different format, but that's about the only big change. PuTTY was a great tool for many years and a lot of people have good reasons to not want to let it go. As with most software it accretes habits and processes built on top of it that are hard to leave. But also useful to sometimes remind about the new options because you never know who wants to be in the Lucky 10K to learn that Windows Terminal now has deeper, "true" terminal emulation or that Windows has ssh "built-in". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chasil](user?id=chasil) [9 months ago](item?id=40045207)   | [parent](#40045170) | [next](#40046201) [–]  I am on a corporate desktop, so I cannot use the Microsoft variant of the ssh-agent: ```   C:\Users\luser>ssh-agent   unable to start ssh-agent service, error :1058  ``` Obviously, getting that changed globally (or even for myself) is impossible.

There are good reasons to allowlist things like Windows Services, sure. How you micro-manage that allowlist can be *bad*. Specific to this case, `ssh-agent` is a Windows Service shipped with Windows and signed by Microsoft. If your allowlist doesn't include built-in Windows services *maybe* your allowlist is deficient. Further specifically in this case, if you are using ssh (and/or sftp) as business tools and expecting some users to have those tools in their job workflows and processes, it *really* doesn't make sense not to allowlist the `ssh-agent` service so that those jobs can be performed, at least for *those users* doing those tasks. That *should* be obvious to any IT person that has used SSH ever before that having access to a reliable SSH agent is important. If your micro-management processes don't have good processes for making the *right* exceptions you teach your users to instead rely on the *wrong* loopholes, that's *bad* corporate policy. (Seriously, why would you encourage users to use an out-of-date program with known vulnerabilities, a tiny bus factor, existing known fakes that are malware vectors in the wild, when you can just quickly allowlist a single Windows service, shipped by Windows, and signed by Microsoft?

If for example only one out of the 60 is short, the attack fails in the lattice reduction step. The reason is that in the attack, all 60 short nonces "collude" to make up a very special short vector in the lattice, which is much shorter than usual because it is short in all 60 dimensions, not just one out of 500 dimensions. The approximate shortest vector is then obtainable in polynomial time, and this happens to contain the secret key by construction. As an analogy: Imagine you had a treasure map with 60 steps "go left, go right, go up, go down, go down again" etc. If only one out of 60 instructions where correct, you wouldn't know where the treasure is. All of the instructions need to be correct to get there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jwilk](user?id=jwilk) [9 months ago](item?id=40045879)   | [parent](#40045403) | [prev](#40045875) | [next](#40047766) [–]  Sure, it happens by chance, but the attacker doesn't know when it happens. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [janmo](user?id=janmo) [9 months ago](item?id=40047766)   | [parent](#40045403) | [prev](#40045879) | [next](#40044961) [–]  Doesn't make sense to me as well, even when fully random after 30,000 signatures you would get around 60 signatures where the nonce starts with nine zero bits.

For DSA that's generally a 256ish-bit prime (e.g.: choose a 1024-bit prime p such that a 256-bit prime q divides p-1; then there exists an order-q subgroup of Zp). For P-521, the base field is 2^521 - 1, but the modulus used when computing the nonce is not that value, it's the *order* of the P-521 curve. By Hasse's theorem, that's roughly p +- sqrt(p), which is essentially p for such large numbers (the cofactor of P-521 is 1, so the order of the group is prime). So: both are 521-bit numbers, but the group order is less than 2^521-1.

If your modulus is too close to the maximum truncated value, there can be a bias in the upper bits, too. For example, if you reduce a number between 0 and 15 by the modulus 13, the values 0, 1 and 2 will be twice as likely as the values 3-12. This means that the highest bit will be 0 in 11 out of 16 cases.

I only use keys generated by and stored on hardware tokens like yubikeys and openpgp smartcards. Edit: To clarify further, the key in that case is not even handled by putty. All crypto ops are done on the token and the private key never leaves it. It can't be exported even because that defeats the purpose of using a hardware token. So putty will just tell the token or smartcard what to sign and the token returns the output. That's why it's safe against this attack. Putty never handles the private key material in this scenario. So I never imported the private key in putty or pageant and I couldn't even if I wanted to. The agent just declares the public keys on the token. I see all the downvotes but I didn't explain it properly. I've been using smart cards so long that these things are kinda a given for me. I can really recommend doing it this way or doing the more modern fido2 auth. Hardware authentication is amazing and it even works on Android over nfc these days. The biggest vulnerability I see is the issue of malware connecting to the unlocked token via the SSH agent, but I'm only using tokens that have touch to sign for this reason.

It never leaves the token, the token carries out all crypto ops on the key itself.

I have never trusted EC crypto because of all the magic involved with it, a sufficient reason to move from RSA has never been presented with compelling evidence as far as I am concerned. I do not care that it is faster, i prefer slow and secure to fast and complicated. It's a lot easier to explain RSA and why it's secure than the mile long justifications on curve crypto. The issue doesn't need to be in the algorithm, if the implementation is sufficiently difficult that works just as well as an intentionally misdesigned algorithm. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kbolino](user?id=kbolino) [9 months ago](item?id=40047973)   | [parent](#40045231) | [next](#40045850) [–]  The benefit of EC is not speed, it is *much* smaller key sizes. Roughly speaking, an RSA key has to be 8 times as large as an EC key for the same security level. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wkat4242](user?id=wkat4242) [9 months ago](item?id=40045850)   | [parent](#40045231) | [prev](#40047973) | [next](#40045239) [–]  Yeah I never bought into the EC thing much either. It's supposed to be safer against quantum but it's also a lot less proven. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lambdafu](user?id=lambdafu) [9 months ago](item?id=40045976)   | [root](#40045231) | [parent](#40045850) | [next](#40045239) [–]  Actually, with currently common key sizes, ECC up to 384 bits will fall to QC before RSA with 1024 bits, because fewer bits means fewer qubits needed. The main disadvantage of RSA is the structure of finite fields, which allows specialized solutions to factoring (number field sieve). We do not know similar structures for elliptic curves, so for those we only have general attacks, thus allowing shorter key lengths. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [AtNightWeCode](user?id=AtNightWeCode) [9 months ago](item?id=40045239)   | [prev](#40045231) | [next](#40048579) [–]  We recommend against ECDSA for internal accounts. I know several of our partners use it though. Hard to not be cynical about this even though this issue seems mostly harmless. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [AtNightWeCode](user?id=AtNightWeCode) [9 months ago](item?id=40046505)   | [parent](#40045239) | [next](#40048579) [–]  NSA disagrees... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cyberpunk](user?id=cyberpunk) [9 months ago](item?id=40048579)   | [prev](#40045239) | [next](#40051622) [–]  One time putty took down our prod rac cluster on Xmas eve, and I spent three days fixing it..

I'm pretty sure they just copied the feature; it's not that they use readline in any way. There's lots of other programs that use C-q for quoting, for example emacs, and readline probably copied it from there in the first place. When pasting text, it's a different code path than quoting. The terminal surely knows when text is being pasted. If nothing else, a simple heuristic based on typing speed is enough to tell apart typing and pasting. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lmz](user?id=lmz) [8 months ago](item?id=40088346)   | [root](#40048579) | [parent](#40073481) | [next](#40049028) [–]  I investigated some more and this is called "bracketed paste" and both the program and terminal must support it (program must enable it). <https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm-paste64.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chgs](user?id=chgs) [9 months ago](item?id=40049028)   | [parent](#40048579) | [prev](#40049035) | [next](#40054121) [–]  Because pasting in OpenSSH doesn’t work? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tryauuum](user?id=tryauuum) [8 months ago](item?id=40056864)   | [root](#40048579) | [parent](#40049028) | [next](#40054121) [–]  nowadays on my Linux terminal if I paste anything containing a newline (which in the past would cause the commands to execute) I get a pop up asking me to confirm Really saves you from the websites putting paragraphs of malicious code into seemingly a single simple line | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chasil](user?id=chasil) [9 months ago](item?id=40054121)   | [parent](#40048579) | [prev](#40049028) | [next](#40050531) [–]  I have a physical standby server for precisely this reason.

I feel like it is the only real way to improve cybersecurity in serious manner. There is so much software in the world that it has become a national security problem. Of course one issue with this, is that as long as the NSA is obviously a leader in cybersecurity, they would rather have software used outside of the US to be less secure, but with time, that strategy might also cause problems.

Subject: CVE-2024-31497: Secret Key Recovery of NIST P-521 Private Keys
 Through Biased ECDSA Nonces in PuTTY Client

### Summary

The PuTTY client and all related components generate heavily biased
ECDSA nonces in the case of NIST P-521. To be more precise, the first 9
bits of each ECDSA nonce are zero. This allows for full secret key
recovery in roughly 60 signatures by using state-of-the-art techniques.
These signatures can either be harvested by a malicious server
(man-in-the-middle attacks are not possible given that clients do not
transmit their signature in the clear) or from any other source, e.g.
signed git commits through forwarded agents. The nonce generation for
other curves is slightly biased as well. However, the bias is negligible
and far from enough to perform lattice-based key recovery attacks (not
considering cryptanalytical advancements).

### Affected Products

- PuTTY 0.68 - 0.80

The following (not necessarily complete) list of products bundle an
affected PuTTY version and are therefore vulnerable as well:

- FileZilla 3.24.1 - 3.66.5
- WinSCP 5.9.5 - 6.3.2
- TortoiseGit 2.4.0.2 - 2.15.0
- TortoiseSVN 1.10.0 - 1.14.6

### Impact

The nonce bias allows for full secret key recovery of NIST P-521 keys
after a malicious actor has seen roughly 60 valid ECDSA signatures
generated by any PuTTY component under the same key. Luckily, client
signatures are transmitted within the secure channel of SSH, requiring a
malicious server to acquire such signatures. If the key has been used to
sign arbitrary data (e.g., git commits by forwarding Pageant to a
development host), the publicly available signatures (e.g., on GitHub)
can be used as well.

All NIST P-521 client keys used with PuTTY must be considered
compromised, given that the attack can be carried out even after the
root cause has been fixed in the source code (assuming that ~60
pre-patch signatures are available to an adversary).

### Mitigations

This vulnerability has been fixed in PuTTY 0.81, FileZilla 3.67.0,
WinSCP 6.3.3, and TortoiseGit 2.15.0.1. Users of TortoiseSVN are advised
to configure TortoiseSVN to use Plink from the latest PuTTY 0.81 release
when accessing a SVN repository via SSH until a patch becomes available.

ECDSA NIST-P521 keys used with any vulnerable product / component should
be considered compromised and consequently revoked by removing them from
authorized_keys, GitHub, ...

### CVE

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-31497.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1222864#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2024-04-15 21:29:46 UTC  ``` In PuTTY 0.68 through 0.80 before 0.81, biased ECDSA nonce generation allows an attacker to recover a user's NIST P-521 secret key via a quick lattice-based attack in approximately 60 signatures. This is especially important in a scenario where an adversary is able to read messages signed by PuTTY or Pageant. One scenario is that the adversary is an operator of an SSH server to which the victim authenticates (for remote login or file copy), even though this server is not fully trusted by the victim, and the victim uses the same private key for SSH connections to other services operated by other entities. Here, the rogue server operator (who would otherwise have no way to determine the victim's private key) can derive the victim's private key, and then use it for unauthorized access to those other services. Because SSH is sometimes used to authenticate to Git services, it is possible that this vulnerability could be leveraged for supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. It is also conceivable that signed messages from PuTTY or Pageant are readable by adversaries more easily in other scenarios, but none have yet been disclosed.   <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-p521-bias.html> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/6> <https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c193fe9848f50a88a4089aac647fecc31ae96d27> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1222864#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2024-04-16 07:22:14 UTC  ``` filezilla bug opened at [bug 1222871](show_bug.cgi?id=1222871 "IN_PROGRESS - VUL-0: CVE-2024-31497: filezilla: putty: NIST P521 private keys are exposed by biased signature generation") ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1222864#c2)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2024-04-16 16:05:02 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1222864) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1168380> Backports:SLE-15-SP5 / putty ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1222864#c3)  Andreas Stieger   2024-05-27 16:35:37 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1225350](show_bug.cgi?id=1225350 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - on 15.6 - old 0.79 putty shipped") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1222864#c4)  Andreas Stieger   2024-05-27 16:36:22 UTC  ``` Fixed in 15.5.  15.6: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1177124> ``` |  |

## Agent Forwarding with PuTTY

1. Once adding your private key to Pageant, open PuTTY and navigate to the Auth menu.

2. Check the 'Allow agent forwarding' checkbox, and return to the Session menu.

3. Enter the Host Name you usually use to connect to Oscar, and click 'Open'.

4. Entering your password. If you have ssh keys setup on your local computer to connect to GitHub, you can confirm your ssh-agent was properly forwarded by checking GitHub . If the ssh command fails, your agent has not been properly forwarded.

Copy
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```
Copy
```
Hi JaneDoe! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.

# Chapter 9: Using Pageant for authentication

Pageant is an SSH authentication agent. It holds your private keys in memory, already decoded, so that you can use them often without needing to type a passphrase.

## 9.1 Getting started with Pageant

Before you run Pageant, you need to have a private key in `*.PPK` format. See [chapter 8](Chapter8.html#pubkey) to find out how to generate and use one.

When you run Pageant, it will put an icon of a computer wearing a hat into the System tray. It will then sit and do nothing, until you load a private key into it. (You may need to use Windows' ‘Show hidden icons’ arrow to see the Pageant icon.)

If you click the Pageant icon with the right mouse button, you will see a menu. Select ‘View Keys’ from this menu. The Pageant main window will appear. (You can also bring this window up by double-clicking on the Pageant icon.)

The Pageant window contains a list box. This shows the private keys Pageant is holding. When you start Pageant, it has no keys, so the list box will be empty. After you add one or more keys, they will show up in the list box.

To add a key to Pageant, press the ‘Add Key’ button. Pageant will bring up a file dialog, labelled ‘Select Private Key File’. Find your private key file in this dialog, and press ‘Open’.

Pageant will now load the private key. If the key is protected by a passphrase, Pageant will ask you to type the passphrase. When the key has been loaded, it will appear in the list in the Pageant window.

Now start PuTTY and open an SSH session to a site that accepts your key. PuTTY will notice that Pageant is running, retrieve the key automatically from Pageant, and use it to authenticate. You can now open as many PuTTY sessions as you like without having to type your passphrase again.

(PuTTY can be configured not to try to use Pageant, but it will try by default. See [section 4.21.4](Chapter4.html#config-ssh-tryagent) and [section 3.11.3.9](Chapter3.html#using-cmdline-agentauth) for more information.)

When you want to shut down Pageant, click the right button on the Pageant icon in the System tray, and select ‘Exit’ from the menu. Closing the Pageant main window does *not* shut down Pageant.

If you want Pageant to stay running but forget all the keys it has acquired, select ‘Remove All Keys’ from the System tray menu.

## 9.2 The Pageant main window

The Pageant main window appears when you left-click on the Pageant system tray icon, or alternatively right-click and select ‘View Keys’ from the menu. You can use it to keep track of what keys are currently loaded into Pageant, and to add new ones or remove the existing keys.

### 9.2.1 The key list box

The large list box in the Pageant main window lists the private keys that are currently loaded into Pageant. The list might look something like this:

```
Ed25519    SHA256:TddlQk20DVs4LRcAsIfDN9pInKpY06D+h4kSHwWAj4w
RSA  2048  SHA256:8DFtyHm3kQihgy52nzX96qMcEVOq7/yJmmwQQhBWYFg

```

For each key, the list box will tell you:

* The type of the key. Currently, this can be ‘RSA’ (an RSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), ‘DSA’ (a DSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), ‘NIST’ (an ECDSA key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), ‘Ed25519’ (an Ed25519 key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), ‘Ed448’ (an Ed448 key for use with the SSH-2 protocol), or ‘SSH-1’ (an RSA key for use with the old SSH-1 protocol). (If the key has an associated certificate, this is shown here with a ‘cert’ suffix.)
* The size (in bits) of the key, for key types that come in different sizes. (For ECDSA ‘NIST’ keys, this is indicated as ‘p256’ or ‘p384’ or ‘p521’.)
* The fingerprint for the public key. This should be the same fingerprint given by PuTTYgen, and (hopefully) also the same fingerprint shown by remote utilities such as `ssh-keygen` when applied to your `authorized_keys` file.

  For SSH-2 keys, by default this is shown in the ‘SHA256’ format. You can change to the older ‘MD5’ format (which looks like `aa:bb:cc:...`) with the ‘Fingerprint type’ drop-down, but bear in mind that this format is less secure and should be avoided for comparison purposes where possible.

  If some of the keys loaded into Pageant have certificates attached, then Pageant will default to showing the fingerprint of the underlying key. This way, a certified and uncertified version of the same key will have the same fingerprint, so you can see that they match. You can instead use the ‘Fingerprint type’ drop-down to ask for a different fingerprint to be shown for certified keys, which includes the certificate as part of the fingerprinted data. That way you can tell two certificates apart.
* The comment attached to the key.
* The state of deferred decryption, if enabled for this key. See [section 9.5](#pageant-deferred-decryption).

### 9.2.2 The ‘Add Key’ button

To add a key to Pageant by reading it out of a local disk file, press the ‘Add Key’ button in the Pageant main window, or alternatively right-click on the Pageant icon in the system tray and select ‘Add Key’ from there.

Pageant will bring up a file dialog, labelled ‘Select Private Key File’. Find your private key file in this dialog, and press ‘Open’. If you want to add more than one key at once, you can select multiple files using Shift-click (to select several adjacent files) or Ctrl-click (to select non-adjacent files).

Pageant will now load the private key(s). If a key is protected by a passphrase, Pageant will ask you to type the passphrase.

(This is not the only way to add a private key to Pageant. You can also add one from a remote system by using agent forwarding; see [section 9.4](#pageant-forward) for details.)

### 9.2.3 The ‘Remove Key’ button

If you need to remove a key from Pageant, select that key in the list box, and press the ‘Remove Key’ button. Pageant will remove the key from its memory.

You can apply this to keys you added using the ‘Add Key’ button, or to keys you added remotely using agent forwarding (see [section 9.4](#pageant-forward)); it makes no difference.

## 9.3 The Pageant command line

Pageant can be made to do things automatically when it starts up, by specifying instructions on its command line. If you're starting Pageant from the Windows GUI, you can arrange this by editing the properties of the Windows shortcut that it was started from.

If Pageant is already running, invoking it again with the options below causes actions to be performed with the existing instance, not a new one.

### 9.3.1 Making Pageant automatically load keys on startup

Pageant can automatically load one or more private keys when it starts up, if you provide them on the Pageant command line. Your command line might then look like:

```
C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe d:\main.ppk d:\secondary.ppk

```

If the keys are stored encrypted, Pageant will request the passphrases on startup.

If Pageant is already running, this syntax loads keys into the existing Pageant.

You can specify the ‘`--encrypted`’ option to defer decryption of these keys; see [section 9.5](#pageant-deferred-decryption).

### 9.3.2 Making Pageant run another program

You can arrange for Pageant to start another program once it has initialised itself and loaded any keys specified on its command line. This program (perhaps a PuTTY, or a WinCVS making use of Plink, or whatever) will then be able to use the keys Pageant has loaded.

You do this by specifying the `-c` option followed by the command, like this:

```
C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe d:\main.ppk -c C:\PuTTY\putty.exe

```
### 9.3.3 Integrating with Windows OpenSSH

Windows's own port of OpenSSH uses the same mechanism as Pageant to talk to its SSH agent (Windows named pipes). This means that Windows OpenSSH can talk directly to Pageant, if it knows where to find Pageant's named pipe.

When Pageant starts up, it can optionally write out a file containing an OpenSSH configuration directive that tells the Windows `ssh.exe` where to find Pageant. If you include this file from your Windows SSH configuration, then `ssh.exe` should automatically use Pageant as its agent, so that you can keep your keys in one place and have both SSH clients able to use them.

The option is `--openssh-config`, and you follow it with a filename.

To refer to this file from your main OpenSSH configuration, you can use the ‘`Include`’ directive. For example, you might run Pageant like this (with your own username substituted, of course):

```
pageant --openssh-config C:\Users\Simon\.ssh\pageant.conf

```

and then add a directive like this to your main ‘`.ssh\config`’ file (assuming that lives in the same directory that you just put `pageant.conf`):

```
Include pageant.conf

```

**Note**: this technique only works with *Windows's* port of OpenSSH, which lives at `C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe` if you have it installed. (If not, it can be installed as a Windows optional feature, e.g., via Settings > Apps & features > Optional features > Add a feature > OpenSSH Client.)

There are other versions of OpenSSH for Windows, notably the one that comes with Windows `git`. Those will likely not work with the same configuration, because they tend to depend on Unix emulation layers like MinGW or MSys, so they won't speak Windows native pathname syntax or understand named pipes. The above instructions will only work with Windows's own version of OpenSSH.

So, if you want to use Windows `git` with an SSH key held in Pageant, you'll have to set the environment variable `GIT_SSH`, to point at a different program. You could point it at `c:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe` once you've done this setup – but it's just as easy to point it at Plink!

### 9.3.4 Unix-domain sockets: integrating with WSL 1

Pageant can listen on the WinSock implementation of ‘Unix-domain sockets’. These interoperate with the Unix-domain sockets found in the original Windows Subsystem for Linux (now known as WSL 1). So if you ask Pageant to listen on one of these, then your WSL 1 processes can talk directly to Pageant.

To configure this, run Pageant with the option `--unix`, followed with a pathname. Then, in WSL 1, set the environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to point at the WSL translation of that pathname.

For example, you might run

```
pageant --unix C:\Users\Simon\.ssh\agent.sock

```

and in WSL 1, set the environment variable

```
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/mnt/c/Users/Simon/.ssh/agent.sock

```

Alternatively, you can add a line to your `.ssh/config` file inside WSL that says

```
IdentityAgent /mnt/c/Users/Simon/.ssh/agent.sock

```

although doing it like that may mean that `ssh-add` commands won't find the agent, even though `ssh` itself will.

**Security note**: Unix-domain sockets are protected against access by other users by the file protections on their containing directory. So if your Windows machine is multiuser, make sure you create the socket inside a directory that other users can't access at all. (In fact, that's a good idea on general principles.)

**Compatibility note**: WSL 2 processes cannot talk to Pageant by this mechanism, because WSL 2's Unix-domain sockets are managed by a separate Linux kernel, and not by the same kernel that WinSock talks to.

### 9.3.5 Starting with the key list visible

Start Pageant with the `--keylist` option to show the main window as soon as it starts up.

### 9.3.6 Restricting the Windows process ACL

Pageant supports the same `-restrict-acl` option as the other PuTTY utilities to lock down the Pageant process's access control; see [section 3.11.3.28](Chapter3.html#using-cmdline-restrict-acl) for why you might want to do this.

By default, if Pageant is started with `-restrict-acl`, it won't pass this to any PuTTY sessions started from its System Tray submenu. Use `-restrict-putty-acl` to change this. (Again, see [section 3.11.3.28](Chapter3.html#using-cmdline-restrict-acl) for details.)

## 9.4 Using agent forwarding

Agent forwarding is a mechanism that allows applications on your SSH server machine to talk to the agent on your client machine.

Note that at present, whether agent forwarding in SSH-2 is available depends on your server. Pageant's protocol is compatible with the OpenSSH server, but the `ssh.com` server uses a different agent protocol, which PuTTY does not yet support.

To enable agent forwarding, first start Pageant. Then set up a PuTTY SSH session in which ‘Allow agent forwarding’ is enabled (see [section 4.21.7](Chapter4.html#config-ssh-agentfwd)). Open the session as normal. (Alternatively, you can use the `-A` command line option; see [section 3.11.3.10](Chapter3.html#using-cmdline-agent) for details.)

If this has worked, your applications on the server should now have access to a Unix domain socket which the SSH server will forward back to PuTTY, and PuTTY will forward on to the agent. To check that this has actually happened, you can try this command on Unix server machines:

```
unixbox:~$ echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
/tmp/ssh-XXNP18Jz/agent.28794
unixbox:~$

```

If the result line comes up blank, agent forwarding has not been enabled at all.

Now if you run `ssh` on the server and use it to connect through to another server that accepts one of the keys in Pageant, you should be able to log in without a password:

```
unixbox:~$ ssh -v otherunixbox
[...]
debug: next auth method to try is publickey
debug: userauth_pubkey_agent: trying agent key my-putty-key
debug: ssh-userauth2 successful: method publickey
[...]

```

If you enable agent forwarding on *that* SSH connection as well (see the manual for your server-side SSH client to find out how to do this), your authentication keys will still be available on the next machine you connect to - two SSH connections away from where they're actually stored.

In addition, if you have a private key on one of the SSH servers, you can send it all the way back to Pageant using the local `ssh-add` command:

```
unixbox:~$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Need passphrase for /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase for /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /home/fred/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/simon/.ssh/id_rsa)
unixbox:~$

```

and then it's available to every machine that has agent forwarding available (not just the ones downstream of the place you added it).

## 9.5 Loading keys without decrypting them

You can add keys to Pageant *without* decrypting them. The key file will be held in Pageant's memory still encrypted, and when a client program first tries to use the key, Pageant will display a dialog box prompting for the passphrase so that the key can be decrypted.

This works the same way whether the key is used by an instance of PuTTY running locally, or a remote client connecting to Pageant through agent forwarding.

To add a key to Pageant in this encrypted form, press the ‘Add Key (encrypted)’ button in the Pageant main window, or alternatively right-click on the Pageant icon in the system tray and select ‘Add Key (encrypted)’ from there. Pageant will bring up a file dialog, in just the same way as it would for the plain ‘Add Key’ button. But it won't ask for a passphrase. Instead, the key will be listed in the main window with ‘(encrypted)’ after it.

To start Pageant up in the first place with encrypted keys loaded into it, you can use the ‘`--encrypted`’ option on the command line. For example:

```
C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe --encrypted d:\main.ppk

```

After a key has been decrypted for the first use, it remains decrypted, so that it can be used again. The main window will list the key with ‘(re-encryptable)’ after it. You can revert it to the previous state, where a passphrase is required, using the ‘Re-encrypt’ button in the Pageant main window.

You can also ‘re-encrypt’ all keys that were added encrypted by choosing ‘Re-encrypt All Keys’ from the System tray menu. (Note that this does *not* discard cleartext keys that were not previously added encrypted!)

**CAUTION**: When Pageant displays a prompt to decrypt an already-loaded key, it cannot give keyboard focus to the prompt dialog box. As far as I know this is a deliberate defensive measure by Windows, against malicious software. So make sure you click in the prompt window before typing your passphrase, or else the passphrase might be sent to somewhere you didn't want to trust with it!

## 9.6 Security considerations

Using Pageant for public-key authentication gives you the convenience of being able to open multiple SSH sessions without having to type a passphrase every time, but also gives you the security benefit of never storing a decrypted private key on disk. Many people feel this is a good compromise between security and convenience.

It *is* a compromise, however. Holding your decrypted private keys in Pageant is better than storing them in easy-to-find disk files, but still less secure than not storing them anywhere at all. This is for two reasons:

* Windows unfortunately provides no way to protect pieces of memory from being written to the system swap file. So if Pageant is holding your private keys for a long period of time, it's possible that decrypted private key data may be written to the system swap file, and an attacker who gained access to your hard disk later on might be able to recover that data. (However, if you stored an unencrypted key in a disk file they would *certainly* be able to recover it.)
* Although, like most modern operating systems, Windows prevents programs from accidentally accessing one another's memory space, it does allow programs to access one another's memory space deliberately, for special purposes such as debugging. This means that if you allow a virus, trojan, or other malicious program on to your Windows system while Pageant is running, it could access the memory of the Pageant process, extract your decrypted authentication keys, and send them back to its master.

Similarly, use of agent *forwarding* is a security improvement on other methods of one-touch authentication, but not perfect. Holding your keys in Pageant on your Windows box has a security advantage over holding them on the remote server machine itself (either in an agent or just unencrypted on disk), because if the server machine ever sees your unencrypted private key then the sysadmin or anyone who cracks the machine can steal the keys and pretend to be you for as long as they want.

However, the sysadmin of the server machine can always pretend to be you *on that machine*. So if you forward your agent to a server machine, then the sysadmin of that machine can access the forwarded agent connection and request signatures from any of your private keys, and can therefore log in to other machines as you. They can only do this to a limited extent - when the agent forwarding disappears they lose the ability - but using Pageant doesn't actually *prevent* the sysadmin (or hackers) on the server from doing this.

Therefore, if you don't trust the sysadmin of a server machine, you should *never* use agent forwarding to that machine. (Of course you also shouldn't store private keys on that machine, type passphrases into it, or log into other machines from it in any way at all; Pageant is hardly unique in this respect.)

Subject: CVE-2024-31497: Secret Key Recovery of NIST P-521 Private Keys
 Through Biased ECDSA Nonces in PuTTY Client

### Summary

The PuTTY client and all related components generate heavily biased
ECDSA nonces in the case of NIST P-521. To be more precise, the first 9
bits of each ECDSA nonce are zero. This allows for full secret key
recovery in roughly 60 signatures by using state-of-the-art techniques.
These signatures can either be harvested by a malicious server
(man-in-the-middle attacks are not possible given that clients do not
transmit their signature in the clear) or from any other source, e.g.
signed git commits through forwarded agents. The nonce generation for
other curves is slightly biased as well. However, the bias is negligible
and far from enough to perform lattice-based key recovery attacks (not
considering cryptanalytical advancements).

### Affected Products

- PuTTY 0.68 - 0.80

The following (not necessarily complete) list of products bundle an
affected PuTTY version and are therefore vulnerable as well:

- FileZilla 3.24.1 - 3.66.5
- WinSCP 5.9.5 - 6.3.2
- TortoiseGit 2.4.0.2 - 2.15.0
- TortoiseSVN 1.10.0 - 1.14.6

### Impact

The nonce bias allows for full secret key recovery of NIST P-521 keys
after a malicious actor has seen roughly 60 valid ECDSA signatures
generated by any PuTTY component under the same key. Luckily, client
signatures are transmitted within the secure channel of SSH, requiring a
malicious server to acquire such signatures. If the key has been used to
sign arbitrary data (e.g., git commits by forwarding Pageant to a
development host), the publicly available signatures (e.g., on GitHub)
can be used as well.

All NIST P-521 client keys used with PuTTY must be considered
compromised, given that the attack can be carried out even after the
root cause has been fixed in the source code (assuming that ~60
pre-patch signatures are available to an adversary).

### Mitigations

This vulnerability has been fixed in PuTTY 0.81, FileZilla 3.67.0,
WinSCP 6.3.3, and TortoiseGit 2.15.0.1. Users of TortoiseSVN are advised
to configure TortoiseSVN to use Plink from the latest PuTTY 0.81 release
when accessing a SVN repository via SSH until a patch becomes available.

ECDSA NIST-P521 keys used with any vulnerable product / component should
be considered compromised and consequently revoked by removing them from
authorized_keys, GitHub, ...

### CVE

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-31497.

# PuTTY vulnerability affecting v0.68 to v0.8. CVE-2024-31497, compromises private key

[General Discussion](/r/sysadmin/?f=flair_name%3A%22General%20Discussion%22)

<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-p521-bias.html>

CVSSv3: 5.9 <https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-31497>

> Every version of the PuTTY tools from 0.68 to 0.80 inclusive has a critical vulnerability in the code that generates signatures from ECDSA private keys which use the NIST P521 curve. The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to **compromise the private key.** The good news: the only affected key type is **521-bit ECDSA.**

Fixed by upgrading to PuTTY v0.81

Update 4/15/24 9:15PM EST:

> If the other services include Git services, then again it may be possible to conduct supply-chain attacks on software maintained in Git. This also affects, for example, FileZilla before 3.67.0, WinSCP before 6.3.3, TortoiseGit before 2.15.0.1, and TortoiseSVN through 1.14.6.

From <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2024/q2/122>

> The following (not necessarily complete) list of products bundle an affected PuTTY version and are therefore vulnerable as well:

* FileZilla 3.24.1 - 3.66.5
* WinSCP 5.9.5 - 6.3.2
* TortoiseGit 2.4.0.2 - 2.15.0
* TortoiseSVN 1.10.0 - 1.14.6
