Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-29183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `redirect` query parameter in the `/login` page of the openrasp cloud interface. The application directly uses this parameter in a `location.href` assignment without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied input (`redirect` query parameter) and reflects it back in the HTML context without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can gain control of a logged-in user's session.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can steal sensitive information like cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's account and data.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `redirect` query parameter. For example: `http://openrasp_cloud.domain/#/login?redirect=javascript:alert(document.cookie)`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious link. This could be done via phishing or other forms of social engineering.

**Additional Details:**
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was patched in commit [240fde3901c7a36aaade3683ffd5c89140a535fb](https://github.com/baidu/openrasp/commit/240fde3901c7a36aaade3683ffd5c89140a535fb).
- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerable code is in the `doLogin` function within `rasp-vue/src/components/Login.vue` at line 81.
- **Validation:** The commit introduced a `validateRedirect` function to check if the redirect URL is safe before assigning it to location.href, mitigating the vulnerability.
- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was found with the help of CodeQL.
