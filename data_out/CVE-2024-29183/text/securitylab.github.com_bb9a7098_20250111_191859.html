## Summary

A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the openrasp cloud interface that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain the session of users.

## Project

openrasp

## Tested Version

[v1.3.7](https://github.com/baidu/openrasp/releases/tag/v1.3.7)

## Details

### reflected XSS in [/login](https://github.com/baidu/openrasp/blob/v1.3.7/rasp-vue/src/components/Login.vue#L81) (`GHSL-2023-253`)

There exists a reflected XSS in the [`/login`](https://github.com/baidu/openrasp/blob/v1.3.7/rasp-vue/src/components/Login.vue#L81) page due to a reflection of the redirect parameter. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript with the permissions of a user after the user logins with their account.

```
doLogin: function() {
      return request.post('v1/user/login', {
        username: this.username,
        password: this.password
      }).then(res => {
        if (this.$route.query.redirect) {
          location.href = this.$route.query.redirect // assignment of query parameter to DOM
        } else {
          this.$router.replace({
            name: 'dashboard'
          })
        }
      })
    }

```

This vulnerability was found with the help of [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-client-side-unvalidated-url-redirection)

#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Privilege Escalation` and `Information Disclosure`

#### Proof of Concept

The following url will create an alert showing the cookie value of the logged in user. This demonstrates that arbitrary javascript can be executed and that the cookie value can be accessed, allowing an attacker to steal the cookie and login. In order to hide the attack from the user, an attacker can url encode as a form of obsfuscation.

`http://openrasp_cloud.domain/#/login?redirect=javascript:alert(document.cookie)`
