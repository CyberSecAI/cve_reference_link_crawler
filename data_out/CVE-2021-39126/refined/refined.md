The content is related to CVE-2021-39126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure issue in referrer headers, which allows a user's CSRF token to be exposed. This exposed token can then be used to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The referrer header reveals the user's CSRF token.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers can use the disclosed token to perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Remote attackers can modify various resources on affected Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center instances by leveraging the disclosed CSRF token in a CSRF attack.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the referrer header, where the CSRF token is leaked. Attackers can potentially use this information via a malicious website or other means to perform CSRF attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to induce the victim to visit a malicious page or perform an action that causes the vulnerable Jira instance to send a request containing the CSRF token in the referrer header. This means the attacker needs a way to control the referrer header of requests sent to the vulnerable server by the user.
