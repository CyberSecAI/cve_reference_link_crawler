The provided content is related to multiple CVEs, including CVE-2022-25213.

**CVE-2022-25213 Details**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `telnetd_startup` daemon listens on UDP port 21210. It uses an RSA public key to "decrypt" data sent by a client, which is then used in combination with a hardcoded secret to construct a password for a telnet service. A vulnerability exists where crafted ciphertext can cause a null byte to appear at the head of the buffer used for password construction. Due to the usage of `sprintf` with the `%s` format specifier the password becomes predictable as the salt string `+TEMP` (or `+PERM`).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Insecure backdoor implementation: The backdoor uses a predictable mechanism to generate passwords for telnet access by manipulating decrypted data and using `sprintf` incorrectly.
    *   The service is not advertised to the router owner and the private key is not provided either.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain a root shell on the device by sending crafted packets to the `telnetd_startup` service.
*  **Attack vectors:** Attacker sends crafted packets to the vulnerable UDP port.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the local network to reach UDP port 21210, or have the ability to port forward from the WAN.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to craft specific network packets to exploit the vulnerability.
