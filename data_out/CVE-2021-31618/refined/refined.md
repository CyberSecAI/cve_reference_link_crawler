  "CVE-2021-31618": {
    "description": "Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47\nApache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.\n\nThis rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.",
    "root_cause": "The rejection response was not fully initialized in the HTTP/2 protocol handler when a header violating size restrictions was the first one received or appeared in a footer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper initialization"
     ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the child process.",
    "attack_vector": "Specially crafted HTTP/2 request.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker can craft and submit an HTTP/2 request that includes a header violating size limitations, and have it be the first header or in a footer.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47. The issue occurs specifically when the offending header is the very first one received or appears in a footer of an HTTP/2 request. This can be triggered by an easy to craft HTTP/2 request."
