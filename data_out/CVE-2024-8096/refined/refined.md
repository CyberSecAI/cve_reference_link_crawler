Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) stapling responses when using the GnuTLS library in curl.
- Specifically, when curl receives an OCSP response with a status other than "revoked" (e.g., "unauthorized"), it fails to recognize this as a failure and incorrectly treats the certificate as valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Certificate Validation: curl does not correctly validate the OCSP status response, leading to a bypass of the intended security checks.
- Failure to Handle Non-Revoked Errors: The code only checks for "revoked" status, while not recognizing other error status codes as failures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to use a certificate that should be considered invalid, potentially leading to:
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks where a malicious actor can intercept communication using an invalid cert.
  - Data modification as a result of the compromised connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a TLS server presenting an invalid certificate along with an OCSP stapling response that indicates a non-revoked error.
- The client (using vulnerable curl with GnuTLS) will fail to recognize the invalid cert, establishing a connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control or be able to influence a TLS server, specifically to present an invalid certificate.
- The attacker must ensure the server provides OCSP stapling information with an error status other than "revoked."
- The client application must be using curl compiled with GnuTLS for TLS support.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in curl versions 7.41.0 up to and including 8.9.1 when built with GnuTLS.
- The vulnerability was fixed in curl version 8.10.0.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation).
- The severity of this vulnerability is considered Medium.
- NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability as they incorporate the vulnerable versions of cURL.
