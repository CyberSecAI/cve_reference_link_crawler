- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Image SEO plugin (versions <= 1.1.4) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious website, email, blog post, or other medium controlled by the attacker that can send a crafted request to the vulnerable website when a logged-in user visits/interacts with it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into visiting a malicious webpage or link that triggers a request to the vulnerable website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim does.
