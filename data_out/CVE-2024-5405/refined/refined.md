**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) as an authenticated user must click the malicious link.
- The attacker does not require any privileges to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload.
- The attacker must persuade an authenticated user to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

-  The specific vulnerable parameters in `/tools/redis.php` are k, hash, key and p.
-  The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.3, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1:AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.
