- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Newsletter Popup plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting lists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection on list deletion functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete lists within the plugin without their consent or knowledge by tricking them into opening a malicious link.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL, which can be delivered via email, malicious website etc. An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted URL to a logged-in WordPress administrator. The attacker does not require any user account on the target site.
