- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and potentially reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could send a message with embedded media stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, the exploit could be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to observe the transmitted traffic, and be able to send a message with embedded media to the targeted user. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
