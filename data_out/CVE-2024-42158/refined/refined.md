The provided content relates to a fix for a potential vulnerability, not a description of the vulnerability itself. The commit messages describe a fix that replaces `memzero_explicit()` and `kfree()` with `kfree_sensitive()` in the s390/pkey driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The original code used `memzero_explicit()` to clear sensitive key material from memory before freeing it with `kfree()`. This was flagged by Coccinelle as a potential vulnerability where sensitive information might not be cleared from memory properly. 

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Improper handling of sensitive data in memory: The use of `memzero_explicit()` followed by `kfree()` may not guarantee that sensitive key material is completely removed from memory, potentially allowing for memory leakage if the memory is not overwritten with zeros before being reused. 

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Information Disclosure: An attacker might potentially recover sensitive cryptographic keys by analyzing memory that was not properly cleared after use.

**Attack vectors**:
- Memory analysis: An attacker with access to system memory (through a crash dump, a memory access exploit or other means) might be able to recover sensitive keys.
- Memory reuse: If the memory region is immediately reused for another purpose, a race condition may allow an attacker to see remnants of the previous key data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- Access to system memory.
- The ability to analyze the memory contents.
