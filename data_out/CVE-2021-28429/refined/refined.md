- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the calculation of `mm` and `hh` variables within the `av_timecode_make_string` function. The multiplication of `fps` with 60 and 3600 could result in an integer overflow, leading to incorrect timecode calculations. Additionally, a division by zero could occur if fps is zero.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow and division by zero.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Incorrect timecode output or potential crashes due to division by zero.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a crafted input with a high frame rate, an attacker could trigger the integer overflow and a division by zero condition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `av_timecode_make_string` function, particularly the `framenum` and `fps` values. This could be achieved by supplying a specially crafted media file that is processed by FFmpeg.
