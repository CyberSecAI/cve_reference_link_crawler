|  |  | title: Themes and Assets |
|  |  | weight: 6 |
|  |  | --- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Compiling assets |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | we use [tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and custom themes by filament, make sure you are familiar with [tailwindcss configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration), and how to make custom [filament theme](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/admin/appearance#building-themes). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Custom Classes: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You need to add these files to your `tailwind.config.js` file in the `content` section. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* frontend: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```js |
|  |  | content: [ |
|  |  | //... |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/resources/views/themes/\*\*/\*.blade.php', |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/src/Models/Columns.php', |
|  |  | ] |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* filament: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```js |
|  |  | content: [ |
|  |  | //... |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/rain/resources/views/filament/\*\*/\*.blade.php', |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/rain/src/Models/Columns.php', |
|  |  | ] |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Customizing the Frontend Views |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | first, publish the config file: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zeus-config |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | then change the default layout in the file `zeus.php`: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | 'layout' => 'components.layouts.app', |
|  |  | // this is assuming your layout on the folder `resources/views/components/layouts/app` |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  | this will give you full control for the assets files and the header and the footer. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If needed, you can publish the blade views for all zeus packages: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zeus-views |
|  |  | ``` |
