# Unvalidated paragraph widget values can be used for XSS

Critical

[atmonshi](/atmonshi)
published
GHSA-c6cw-g7fc-4gwc
Oct 6, 2024

## Package

composer

lara-zeus/artemis
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0, < 1.0.6

## Patched versions

v1.0.7

composer

lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.1

v3.0.2

## Description

# Summary

If values passed to a paragraph widget are not valid and contain a specific set of characters, applications are vulnerable to XSS attack against a user who opens a page on which a paragraph widget is rendered.

Versions of dynamic dashboard from v3.0.0 through v3.0.2 are affected.

Please upgrade to dynamic dashboard [v3.0.2](https://github.com/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/releases/tag/v3.0.2).

# PoC

> PoC will be published in a few weeks, once developers have had a chance to upgrade their apps.

# Response

This vulnerability (in paragraph widget only) was reported by **Raghav Sharma**, who reported the issue and patched the issue during the morning of 05/10/2024. Thank you **Raghav Sharma**.

The review process concluded the same day at night, which revealed the issue was also present in paragraph widget. This was fixed the same day and dynamic dashboard [v3.0.2](https://github.com/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/releases/tag/v3.0.2) followed.

## Note:

if you're published the view (blade files), you have to republish them or check the changes on release to update the affected file.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-47817

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Compiling assets |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | we use [tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and custom themes by filament, make sure you are familiar with [tailwindcss configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration), and how to make custom [filament theme](https://filamentphp.com/docs/2.x/admin/appearance#building-themes). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Custom Classes: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You need to add these files to your `tailwind.config.js` file in the `content` section. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* frontend: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```js |
|  |  | content: [ |
|  |  | //... |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/resources/views/themes/\*\*/\*.blade.php', |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/dynamic-dashboard/src/Models/Columns.php', |
|  |  | ] |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* filament: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```js |
|  |  | content: [ |
|  |  | //... |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/rain/resources/views/filament/\*\*/\*.blade.php', |
|  |  | './vendor/lara-zeus/rain/src/Models/Columns.php', |
|  |  | ] |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### Customizing the Frontend Views |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | first, publish the config file: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zeus-config |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | then change the default layout in the file `zeus.php`: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | 'layout' => 'components.layouts.app', |
|  |  | // this is assuming your layout on the folder `resources/views/components/layouts/app` |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  | this will give you full control for the assets files and the header and the footer. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If needed, you can publish the blade views for all zeus packages: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```php |
|  |  | php artisan vendor:publish --tag=zeus-views |
|  |  | ``` |
