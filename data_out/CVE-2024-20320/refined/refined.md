- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of arguments included with the SSH client CLI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A vulnerability exists in the SSH client feature of Cisco IOS XR Software due to a lack of proper validation of arguments in the CLI command. This allows for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged attacker to elevate privileges to *root* on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with low-privileged access to an affected device can exploit the vulnerability by issuing a crafted SSH client command to the CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low-privileged access to the affected Cisco IOS XR device.
