    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-24891",
      "description": "The provided content indicates that CVE-2024-24891 is related to a fix in the `drivers/staging/gmjstcm/tcm.c` file within the Linux kernel. It refers to the import of fixes for CVE-2011-1160 and CVE-2011-1162. These earlier CVEs describe vulnerabilities within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) driver, which is similar to the TCM driver. The TCM driver has an information leak vulnerability, the fix addresses the issue by properly zeroing out memory after copying to user space in tcm_read and zeroing out the memory block when allocating memory in tcm_open.",
        "root_cause": "The root cause is improper handling of memory after copying to userspace and improper initialization of allocated memory, leading to information exposure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leakage"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from kernel memory, including the last TCM instruction or other potentially sensitive data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the device driver via the /dev interface",
        "Reading from the TCM device file through the tcm_read function.",
		"Opening the TCM device file through the tcm_open function"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to interact with the TCM device driver.",
        "additional_details": "The fix involves ensuring that the memory used in `tcm_read` is zeroed after the `copy_to_user` operation, preventing the user from reading stale data, also zeroing out the memory block when allocating memory in `tcm_open`. The specific files affected are `drivers/staging/gmjstcm/tcm.c`."
