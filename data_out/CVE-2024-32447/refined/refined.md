- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AWP Classifieds plugin (<= 4.3.1) lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the affected website by leveraging the user's current authentication. This can lead to unintended changes, data manipulation, or other harmful activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into performing an action without their knowledge (e.g., via a malicious link or website).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website, without the user's knowledge or consent. The attacker does not require prior authentication to the targeted website but rather relies on the victim user's authenticated session.
