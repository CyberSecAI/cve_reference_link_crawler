| ``` 	r.NoRoute(func(c *gin.Context) { 		fmt.Printf("%s doesn't exists, redirect on /\n", c.Request.URL.Path) 		c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, "/") 	}) ```  Flaw reason: in the `internal/app/routes/routes go` file of 53 line, using the `FMT. Printf` to print log, the log content contains the user to provide the value of (`c.R equest. URL. The Path`). This means that an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the log by controlling the URL path to inject malicious code or special characters Or cause other security risks. This is known as a log injection attack.  Vulnerability POC: An attacker can attempt to inject malicious code into the log by including a specific string or snippet of code in the URL path. For example, if an application does not properly handle or escape special characters in a URL path, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information. |

| Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have addressed the issue with the `NoRoute` handler in our Gin application. The vulnerability related to log injection has been fixed. We have updated our logging mechanism to properly escape any special characters and user-provided values to prevent arbitrary code execution or sensitive information leakage in the logs. We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain a secure application. |

# Submit #393987: Go-Tribe gotribe-admin 1.0 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | Go-Tribe gotribe-admin 1.0 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs |
| --- | --- |
| Description | r.NoRoute(func(c \*gin.Context) { fmt.Printf("%s doesn't exists, redirect on /\n", c.Request.URL.Path) c.Redirect(http.StatusMovedPermanently, "/") }) Flaw reason: in the internal/app/routes/routes go file of 53 line, using the FMT. Printf to print log, the log content contains the user to provide the value of (c.R equest. URL. The Path). This means that an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the log by controlling the URL path to inject malicious code or special characters Or cause other security risks. This is known as a log injection attack. Vulnerability POC: An attacker can attempt to inject malicious code into the log by including a specific string or snippet of code in the URL path. For example, if an application does not properly handle or escape special characters in a URL path, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive information. |
