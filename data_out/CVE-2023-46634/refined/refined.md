{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, executes unintended actions on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into triggering the crafted request. This often involves social engineering, such as embedding malicious code in a website or email."
