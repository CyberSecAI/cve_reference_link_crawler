For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-bshacepe-bApeHSx7>  This advisory is part of the August 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2024 Semiannual Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75417).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and had either Bash shell enabled or a user who was configured to use the Bash shell at login:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine Whether Bash Shell is Enabled**  To determine whether Bash shell is enabled, use the **show feature | include bash** CLI command, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show feature | include bashbash-shell             1          enabled    ```  **Note:** This feature is disabled by default.  **Determine Whether Users are Configured to Use the Bash Shell at Login**  To determine whether users are configured to use Bash shell at login, use the **show running-config | include shelltype** CLI command, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show running-config | include shelltypeusername testuser shelltype bash   ```  If no result is returned, then Bash shell at login is not configured.  **Note**: Users who are configured for **shelltype bash** will be at the Bash shell when they log in successfully. This does not require Bash shell to be enabled.  Bash shell authorization was restricted to users with a *network-admin* or *dev-ops* role, with a custom role-based access control (RBAC) role, or with **shelltype bash** configured. In addition to the fixes for these vulnerabilities, hardening measures have been added to restrict Bash shell access to only users with the *network-admin* role or a custom RBAC role, explicitly allowing access to run the **bash** command. For more information, see the following bug IDs:    + [CSCwj42387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj42387): Removal of Bash shell access for *dev-ops* role   + [CSCwj51942](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj51942): Restrict Bash shell access to only *network-admin* role   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode   + Secure Firewall 3100 Series   + Secure Firewall 4200 Series   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20411: Cisco NX-OS Software Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell toexecute arbitrary code as *root* on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions when executing commands from the Bash shell. An attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific crafted command on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of *root*.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwh77791](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh77791)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20411Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2024-20413: Cisco NX-OS Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell toelevate privileges to *network-admin* on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions when executing application arguments from the Bash shell. An attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell could exploit this vulnerability by executing crafted commands on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create new users with the privileges of *network-admin*.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwh77783](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh77783)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20413Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 6.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).  To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search-only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or all advisories.   2. Choose the appropriate software.   3. Choose the appropriate platform.   4. Enter a release number-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode.   5. Click **Check**.
