{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The provided crash report indicates a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `Js::ProfilingHelpers::ProfiledNewScArray` function in ChakraCore. This function is likely involved in allocating or initializing a new ScriptContext Array during profiling. The crash occurs due to a read access to an invalid memory location, specifically the zero page (address 0x000000000000).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to invalid memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the ChakraCore runtime to crash. This could potentially lead to denial-of-service (DoS) if an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific JavaScript code sequence that involves asynchronous functions, promises, and debug profiling features of the engine. The attacker needs to execute the specially crafted Javascript code, specifically the `mainTest` function with `notAttachCall` set to `true`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a ChakraCore environment. This might be achieved via a web browser or other application embedding the engine."
