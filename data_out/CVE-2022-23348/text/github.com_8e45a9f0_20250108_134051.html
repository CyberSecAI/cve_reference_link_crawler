# Vulnerability

BigAnt Server Version 5.6.06 suffers from Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort

# Prerequisites

Example 01: None

Example 02: None

Example 03: Local client system access

# Exploit

## Example 01: Service Admin Password

**Combined with improper Access control, the Service Admin Password can be retrieved from the following URL by any non-authenticated user. The format of the password is in an easily crackable MD5 hash format**

`http://<IPaddress>:8000/Runtime/Data/ms_admin.php`

[![](/bzyo/cve-pocs/raw/master/CVE-2022-23348/imgs/service-admin-pass.png)](/bzyo/cve-pocs/blob/master/CVE-2022-23348/imgs/service-admin-pass.png)

## Example 02: SQL Logs - User Passwords

**Combined with improper Access control, all SQL log files are accessible to any non-authenticated user from the following base URL `http://<IPaddress>:8000/Runtime/Logs/`**

**Directories and log file names can be easily discovered and downloaded.  All SQL changes including passwords in MD5 hashes for the Super Admin and all other accounts can be retrieved.**

## Example 03: UltraVNC access

**The UltraVNC client is installed by default so any client can simply run and connect to other clients if the service is running**

**A password is required and is stored and the same on each client. It is encrypted though**

**This can be easily cracked using a downloadable program**
