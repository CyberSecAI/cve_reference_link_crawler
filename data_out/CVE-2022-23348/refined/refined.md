Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-23348:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The primary vulnerability stems from the use of weak password hashing algorithms (MD5) and improper access controls within the BigAnt Server application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** Passwords for the service admin and user accounts are stored as MD5 hashes, which are easily crackable.
*   **Improper Access Control:** Sensitive files, including the service admin password and SQL log files containing user password hashes, are accessible to unauthenticated users via HTTP requests.
*   **Default UltraVNC Client:** The installation includes a default UltraVNC client that can be used to connect to other clients if the service is running. The password for this client is the same for all clients and is encrypted, but can be cracked.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Full system compromise:** Attackers can retrieve the service admin password, gain access to all user accounts, and potentially control the BigAnt server.
*   **Remote access:** Attackers can leverage the pre-installed UltraVNC client to gain remote access to systems.
*   **Data breach:** The compromise of the server can lead to the theft of sensitive data stored within the application or accessible through connected systems.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** Attackers can directly access sensitive files by crafting specific HTTP requests to the BigAnt server without any authentication.
*   **UltraVNC client Exploitation:** Attackers can crack the UltraVNC password and remotely access other clients that have this software running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the target BigAnt server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The primary attack vectors do not require authentication, which means any attacker with network access can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
*   **UltraVNC Client:** To exploit the UltraVNC feature, the attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable client machine.

**Additional details:**
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits including screenshots showing vulnerable endpoints and how to retrieve service admin passwords, user password hashes via SQL logs and exploiting the default UltraVNC client.
*   The timeline shows that the vulnerability was reported to the vendor in Dec 2021 but the vendor did not respond or address the issue.
