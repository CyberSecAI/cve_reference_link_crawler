- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Captcha plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack can be initiated by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page, which then executes unwanted actions on the vulnerable website while the user is authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
