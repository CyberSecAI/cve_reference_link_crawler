- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path to escalate privileges was identified in Puppet Bolt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate their privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly mentioned, but the CVSS indicates the attack vector is adjacent. This likely means the attacker must be on the same network segment as the target.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low privileges (PR:L) and be on the same network segment as the target (AV:A). Exploitation requires a complex condition (AC:H)
