- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before including it in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking on a crafted URL. This can result in arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the user's browser. The malicious script could potentially steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL. The attacker creates a malicious link that includes JavaScript code in a query parameter or other part of the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL, which can then be sent to a victim through social engineering or other means. The attacker does not need any direct access to the vulnerable application server. The attacker only needs to convince a victim to click the malicious link.
