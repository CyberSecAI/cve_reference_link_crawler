- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress DS Site Message Plugin <= 1.14.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will perform an action on the application, impersonating the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a link or visiting a page that triggers the malicious request. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
