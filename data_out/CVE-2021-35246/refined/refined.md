The provided content contains information about CVE-2021-35246.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to prevent users from connecting over unencrypted connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application does not enforce the use of SSL/TLS encryption. Specifically, it lacks HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intercept and modify network traffic, bypassing SSL/TLS encryption. This could allow the attacker to use the application as a platform for attacks against its users, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can modify a legitimate user's network traffic. This could include man-in-the-middle attacks on insecure networks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the user and the application. This often involves being on the same network or having control of a network device in the path of communication.

**Affected Products:**
- ETS 2020.2.6 HF4

**Fixed Software Release:**
- Engineerâ€™s Toolset 2022.4 Desktop
