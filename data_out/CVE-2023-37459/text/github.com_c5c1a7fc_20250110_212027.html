# Out-of-bounds read when processing a received IPv6 packet

Low

[nvt](/nvt)
published
GHSA-6648-m23r-hq8c
Sep 15, 2023

## Package

os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c

## Affected versions

<= 4.9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

When a packet is received, the Contiki-NG network stack attempts to start the periodic TCP timer if it is a TCP packet with the SYN flag set. But the implementation does not first verify that a full TCP header has been received. Specifically, the implementation attempts to access the flags field from the TCP buffer in the following conditional expression in the `check_for_tcp_syn` function.

`(UIP_TCP_BUF->flags & TCP_SYN) == TCP_SYN)`

For this reason, an attacker can inject a truncated TCP packet, which will lead to a memory read outside the packet data.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG.

### Workarounds

One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request [#2510](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2510) to patch the system.
