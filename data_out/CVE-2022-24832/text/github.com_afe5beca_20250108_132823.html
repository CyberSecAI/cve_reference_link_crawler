# GoCD before 22.1.0 bundled ldap-authentication-plugin fails to neutralise LDAP special elements in usernames

High

[chadlwilson](/chadlwilson)
published
GHSA-x5v3-x9qj-mh3h
Apr 9, 2022

## Package

gocd-server

## Affected versions

>= 17.5.0, < 22.1.0

## Patched versions

22.1.0

## Description

### Impact

The bundled [gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries.

While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms.

This only affects users who have a working LDAP [authorization configuration](https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication) enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration.

### Patches

Fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin [v2.2.0-144](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.0-144).

### Workarounds

* removing any [authorization configurations](https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication) for the bundled LDAP Authentication plugin
* if running outside Docker/Helm, users on GoCD `20.9.0`+ can manually upgrade the bundled plugin to [v2.2.0-144](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.0-144)
* users on GoCD `20.9.0`+ not able to upgrade to `22.1.0` can consider migrating their LDAP authorization configuration to the [patched v4.2.0-73+ version](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authorization-plugin/releases/tag/v4.2.0-73) of the [LDAP Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authorization-plugin), which supports both authentication and (optional) authorization to map to GoCD roles. This plugin was also subject to the same vulnerability in versions <=`4.1.0`, however since it is non-bundled, it is more easily user-upgraded.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
