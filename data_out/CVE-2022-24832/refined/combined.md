# GoCD LDAP/AD Authentication Plugin

LDAP plugin which implements the GoCD [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization/) endpoint.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## Requirements

These plugins require GoCD version v17.5 or above.

## Installation

* From GoCD `17.5.0` onwards the plugin comes bundled along with server, hence a separate installation is not required.

## Ldap Client

The plugin uses JNDI and ApacheDs ldap client for the authentication. Defaults to `ApacheDs client`. In order to use JNDI
client use system property `use.jndi.ldap.client=true` while starting the GoCD server.

## Configuration

The plugin requires necessary configurations to connect to LDAP/AD. The configuration can be added by adding a Authorization Configuration by visting the Authorization Configuration page under *Admin > Security*.

Alternatively, the configuration can be added directly to the `config.xml` using the `<authConfig>` configuration.

* Example Configuration

  ```
   <security>
     <authConfigs>
       <authConfig id="profile-id" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.ldap">
         <property>
           <key>Url</key>
           <value>ldap://ldap-server-url</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>ManagerDN</key>
           <value>cn=go,ou=Teams,dc=corporate,dc=example,dc=com</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>Password</key>
           <value>secret</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>SearchBases</key>
           <value>ou=Teams,dc=corporate,dc=example,dc=com</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>UserLoginFilter</key>
           <value>(sAMAccountName={0})</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>UserSearchFilter</key>
           <value>(|(sAMAccountName=*{0}*)(uid=*{0}*)(cn=*{0}*)(mail=*{0}*)(otherMailbox=*{0}*))</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>DisplayNameAttribute</key>
           <value>displayName</value>
         </property>
         <property>
           <key>EmailAttribute</key>
           <value>mail</value>
         </property>
       </authConfig>
     </authConfigs>
   </security>
  ```
* **Url (Mandatory) :** Specify your ldap server URL. The plugin does not [support](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/issues/24) configuring certificates for connecting to LDAP server over SSL, a workaround for this issue involves importing the certificates directly into java's cacerts.

  ```
  <property>
     <key>Url</key>
     <value>ldap://ldap-server-url:1234</value>
  </property>
  ```

if you are trying to configure ldaps then use the url as:

```
```xml
<property>
   <key>Url</key>
   <value>ldaps://ldap-server-url:1234</value>
</property>
```

```

* **ManagerDN (Optional):** The LDAP/AD manager user's DN, used to connect to the LDAP/AD server.

  ```
  <property>
     <key>ManagerDN</key>
     <value>uid=admin,ou=system,dc=example,dc=com</value>
  </property>
  ```
* **Password (Mandatory if `ManagerDN` provided):** The LDAP/AD manager password, used to connect to the LDAP/AD server. Required only if a ManagerDN is specified.
* **SearchBases (Mandatory):** This field defines the location in the directory from which the LDAP search begins.
  You can provide multiple search bases. If multiple search bases are configured the plugin would look for the user in each search base sequentially until the user is found.

  > Single search base:

  ```
  <property>
     <key>SearchBases</key>
     <value>ou=users,ou=system</value>
  </property>
  ```
  > Multiple search base

  ```
  <property>
     <key>SearchBases</key>
     <value>
      ou=users,ou=system
      ou=employee,ou=system
      </value>
  </property>
  ```
* **UserLoginFilter (Mandatory):** It is an LDAP search filter used during authentication to lookup for a user entry matching the given expression.

  In the following example the filter would search for a username matching the `sAMAccountName` attribute.

  ```
  <property>
     <key>UserLoginFilter</key>
     <value>(sAMAccountName={0})</value>
  </property>
  ```
* **UserSearchFilter (Optional):** It is an LDAP search filter used to lookup for users matching a given search term.
  This is an optional configuration, the default filter used is `(|(sAMAccountName=*{0}*)(uid=*{0}*)(cn=*{0}*)(mail=*{0}*)(otherMailbox=*{0}*))`.

  ```
  <property>
     <key>UserSearchFilter</key>
     <value>(|(sAMAccountName=*{0}*)(uid=*{0}*))</value>
  </property>
  ```
* **DisplayNameAttribute (Optional):** Value of this attribute is mapped to GoCD User displayname, default attribute used is `cn`.

  ```
  <property>
     <key>DisplayNameAttribute</key>
     <value>displayName</value>
  </property>
  ```
* **EmailAttribute (Optional):** Value of this attribute is mapped to GoCD User mail, default value used is `mail`.

  ```
   <property>
       <key>EmailAttribute</key>
       <value>mail</value>
   </property>
  ```

*Note: The plugin allows having multiple configurations to connect to different LDAP/AD servers*

```
<authConfig id="second-profile-id" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.ldap">
...
</authConfig>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Verify Connection

For a given Authorization Configuration verify if the plugin can connect to the LDAP/AD server. The Authorization Configuration page under *Admin > Security* gives an option to verify connection.

### Enable Debug Logs

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.6 and above:

Edit the file `wrapper-properties.conf` on your GoCD server and add the following options. The location of the `wrapper-properties.conf` can be found in the [installation documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/installing_go_server.html) of the GoCD server.

```
# We recommend that you begin with the index `100` and increment the index for each system property
wrapper.java.additional.105=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.ldap.log.level=debug
```

For this to work it's extremely important that there are no other entries with the same index number for `wrapper.java.additional`. E.g. with the docker version in the docker-entrypoint.sh is a line that adds an item for `wrapper.java.additional.100` but *only* after boot time.

If you're running with GoCD server 19.6 and above on docker using one of the supported GoCD server images, set the environment variable `GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTIONS`:

```
docker run -e "GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTIONS=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.ldap.log.level=debug" ...
```

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.5 and lower:

* On Linux:

  Enabling debug level logging can help you troubleshoot an issue with this plugin. To enable debug level logs, edit the file `/etc/default/go-server` (for Linux) to add:

  ```
  export GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="$GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES -Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.ldap.log.level=debug"
  ```

  If you're running the server via `./server.sh` script:

  ```
  $ GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.ldap.log.level=debug" ./server.sh
  ```
* On windows:

  Edit the file `config/wrapper-properties.conf` inside the GoCD Server installation directory (typically `C:\Program Files\Go Server`):

  ```
  # config/wrapper-properties.conf
  # since the last "wrapper.java.additional" index is 15, we use the next available index.
  wrapper.java.additional.16=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.ldap.log.level=debug

  ```

### Known issues while upgrading to Plugin version 2.0.1-90

* A must change would be to now specify a fully qualified ManagerDN instead of just username.
* The user search base specified should return unique result for the given username.

### 24.5.0 (latest)

This release is a security, maintenance and bug-fix release.

#### Security Fixes

This release has important security fixes relating to admin functionality. We recommend all users upgrade to this version to safeguard your GoCD server.
There are no major compatibility changes in this release, nor since the change to require Java 17 included in 24.1.0, so upgrading should be
straightforward for most users.

If you cannot upgrade immediately, we recommend you mitigate the most critical of these issues by blocking access to
URLs prefixed with `/go/rails`. Doing so has no impact on GoCD functionality.

These security vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed via high quality research performed by [Joe Zhou (byc\_404)](https://github.com/baiyecha404) and
the team extend our thanks for their efforts. We want to give users some time to mitigate or upgrade, before providing
more details about the vulnerabilities. These will be disclosed via GitHub Security Advisories and formal CVEs.

### 24.2.0

This release is a maintenance and bug-fix release.

#### Java 21 support

GoCD is now built with, tested against and distributed with Java 21 LTS. Java 17 remains the minimum supported version
for bring-your-own-JRE setups. There were no specific changes needed to support Java 21, so the prior release 24.1.0
can be considered the first version that supports Java 21.

#### Windows installers no longer signed

Windows installers were previously code-signed with a "proper" Thoughtworks-issued OV code-signing certificate from
DigiCert that avoided Windows SmartScreen prompts. Due to both certificate cost and changes in requirements for OV
code-signing certificates (to have hardware-managed keys), in the short term this is no longer sustainable for GoCD.
Therefore installers are not be signed from 24.2.0 onwards.

GoCD can still be installed on Windows subsequent to this change, however users will need to review and accept
warnings from Windows during installation. Note that runtime binaries *are still signed* as before, such as the Java
runtime and service wrapper binaries; so this change only affects installation - not runtime.

If you have a suggestion of approach to reinstate Windows code signing for a open-source project with limited funding,
or know other projects which have done so, [please reach out](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues)!

#### Enhancements

* [#12762](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12762) - Build, test and package GoCD with Java 21 LTS by default
* [#12792](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12792) - Make JRE dependencies from RPM and Debian packages optional/recommended
* [#12761](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12761), [#12828](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12828) - Add AlmaLinux 9 based GoCD agent image to replace CentOS Stream
* Starting this release, [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-almalinux-9).

#### Bug fixes

* [#12765](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12765) - Tasks on gocd-agent-docker-dind:v24.1.0 image cannot interact with Docket socket by default

#### Security fixes

While we don't regularly release new GoCD versions to address container image dependencies, this release patches git
binaries within container images due to [CVE-2024-32002](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8h77-4q3w-gfgv)
and several other issues of particular concern to a build/deploy automation tool such as GoCD. You can read more about
the issues on [the GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2024-05-14-securing-git-addressing-5-new-vulnerabilities/). Note that
at time of release, Debian images have [not had the most critical patch backported](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-32002)
to Debian 11 or 12, so the gocd-agent-debian variants for 24.2.0 are still vulnerable. Ubuntu variants are [all patched](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-32002)
as are Alpine and Wolfi variants.

We regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.

### 24.1.0

This release is a maintenance and bug-fix release, although there are several *potentially breaking* changes to be aware of:

* Links are no longer force-opened in new tabs
* Java 17 is now the minimum supported version
* Server container image is now based on Wolfi OS

#### Links are no longer force-opened in new tabs

A long-standing frustration with GoCD's UI is that it used to open new tabs for links, partly to avoid losing your
place on the main dashboard when investigating an individual stage/job. However, browsers are now much better at remembering
the *"back"* state; and the previous behaviour was confusing & frustrating.

From now on control will be returned to users - for a new tab to be opened (foreground or background) in most cases
users will need to use the browser/OS specific key combination or *middle-click equivalent* to do so.

If you are interested in making this a configurable option to add back the old behaviour,
[discussion](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/discussions/9613) or [pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pulls).

#### Java 17 is now the minimum supported version

Java 17 was released in September 2021, and has had complete support within GoCD since version 22.1.0, over 2 years ago.
Since then it has been packaged with both GoCD container images & installers by default.

This has proven to be be very stable, so to reduce maintenance overhead we are now making Java 17 the minimum supported
version.

If you are *aiming for minimal agent/server downtime* in an upgrade to GoCD 24.1.0+, you can do so by following:

1. Ensure your existing agents are running with Java 17+.
   * If your agents are using GoCD 22.1.0+ from *official GoCD containers or packages* (RPM, deb)s there is *nothing extra to do*. These already package and run Java 17+.
   * If your agents are using GoCD 22.1.0+ from *other install approaches*, they are already Java 17-compatible, *if your server is 21.4.0+*. Ensure they are running with Java 17+.
2. Ensure your existing server is running with Java 17+.
   * If your server is using GoCD 22.1.0+ from *official GoCD containers or packages* (RPM, deb)s there is *nothing extra to do*. These already package and run Java 17+.
   * If your server is using GoCD 21.4.0+ from *other install approaches*, is is already Java 17-compatible, *if your server is 21.4.0+*. Ensure they are running with Java 17+.
3. Upgrade your server to GoCD 24.1.0 without worry about Java issues.
   * Older agents running Java 17+ will re-start automatically against a GoCD 24.1.0 server.
   * You can now validate your installation and agents are working fine.
4. (Optionally) You can now upgrade your agents to GoCD 24.1.0 whenever you choose.
   * Technically GoCD agent installs are only a "bootstrapper" which downloads the matching agent code from the server for
     each release. It is wise to avoid too much discrepancy in versions to make upgrades (like this one!) easier, but it is
     not critical.

If you have issues, *downgrades* back to 22.1.0+ should be fine - there have been no breaking database or configuration
changes within these versions. If you have any further queries/issues, please ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/discussions) or the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/go-cd).

#### Server container image is now based on Wolfi OS

The GoCD server container has always been based on a minimal Linux distribution, previously [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/),
but from 24.1.0 has been switched to [Wolfi OS](https://github.com/wolfi-dev). Wolfi OS is a similarly minimal,
security-oriented (un)distro from the folks at [Chainguard](https://www.chainguard.dev/) which is
[optimized for supply-chain security](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro-designed-for-securing-the-software-supply-chain) -
and unlike the *musl*-based Alpine uses *glibc*, similar to most other distributions.

Unfortunately, the use of Alpine has always posed difficulties due to its musl libc base. Most of the time this is an
irrelevant detail to users, however it has posed issues for GoCD packaging of Java runtime environments & providing aarch64
availability for a variety of reasons stemming from GoCD's dependencies. While GoCD has applied relatively stable
workarounds to support Alpine, these are not recommended and have prevented providing a default GoCD server container
image for *aarch64*/*arm64* architectures off-the-shelf.

Wolfi uses the same *apk* package manager as Alpine, with conventional package names, and although packages cannot be
used across the two OSes, the transition should be easy for most folks. The image is now multi-architecture (*amd64*/*x64* and *aarch64*/*arm64*)
making it usable out-of-the-box within arm64 cloud instances and Apple Silicon Macs.

If you build a child container from the [gocd-server container](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server), from 24.1.0
you will need to review your *Dockerfile* to check that:

* any additional packages you need to install are [available for Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os).
* any pre-compiled binaries specifically compiled for musl should be switched to glibc variants

There has previously been a non-officially documented multi-arch [server image based on CentOS Stream](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server-centos-9),
which was the only option on *aarch64*. This will be *removed*, as it is unnecessary now we have a glibc-based image.
If you were using this, please switch back to *gocd/gocd-server* rather than *gocd/gocd-server-centos-\**.

#### Agent container image changes

1. A [*Wolfi-based agent image*](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-wolfi/tags) is now available, matching the
   server image. This will become the default recommended agent image for container-based elastic agents.
2. The *Alpine agent images* will now become a *rolling* distribution within the [gocd-agent-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine)
   repository. This means that the repository will not change for each Alpine release (3.18, 3.19 etc) any longer. Alpine releases new
   versions each 6 months while maintaining very good compatibility, and maintaining different repositories added unnecessary
   maintenance overhead. Each GoCD release will be based on the latest compatible Alpine release, mirroring how [gocd-agent-docker-dind](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-docker-dind)
   has always been released. GoCD 23.5.0 will be the last version released under version specific repos ([3.16](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.16), [3.17](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.17), [3.18](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.18), [3.19](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.19)).
3. [*CentOS Stream 8*](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-8) [*and 9*](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-9)
   based container images will be discontinued after 24.1.0. While these images are stable and well-maintained, they are
   not as widely used other images, and as a distribution upstream of RHEL, Rocky, Alma etc, CentOS Stream has not
   proved to get an appropriate level of security/maintenance patches for dependencies, nor the official security
   bulletins needed for containers tools to accurate scan the images. If you are using these images, and would prefer a
   Red Hat/RHEL-like image, [please open an issue!](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues). We are open to bring back an
   Alma or Rocky-based image to meet the needs of those who want to keep their agent containers within the RHEL ecosystem.

#### Windows installers no longer signed after 24.1.0

Windows installers were previously code-signed with a "proper" Thoughtworks-issued OV code-signing certificate from
DigiCert that avoided Windows SmartScreen prompts. Due to both certificate cost and changes in requirements for OV
code-signing certificates (to have hardware-managed keys), in the short term this is no longer sustainable for GoCD.
Therefore installers will likely not be signed from 24.2.0 onwards when the existing certificate expires.

GoCD can still be installed on Windows subsequent to this change, however users will need to review and accept
warnings from Windows during installation. Note that runtime binaries *are still signed* as before, such as the Java
runtime and service wrapper binaries; so this change only affects installation - not runtime.

If you have a suggestion of approach to reinstate Windows code signing for a open-source project with limited funding,
or know other projects which have done so, [please reach out](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues)!

### 23.4.0

This release is mainly a maintenance and bug-fix release.

#### Jetty web server upgrade

GoCD relies internally upon the [Eclipse Jetty web server](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/), which was
upgraded from v9 to v10 in this release.

If you customise the configuration of the web server via *config/jetty.xml* or by overriding the Java system property
*jetty.xml.file.name*, note that any custom configuration will be overridden to ensure compatibility with the new version.
After upgrading, shut down your GoCD server and merge back your custom changes from a backup of your config directory
/ Jetty configuration. You can [review the changes to jetty.xml here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/5d7f3ccb107224fa376938690a8f7721357cddff#diff-7bbdaff7e1127a406cdce7bffae1167d66ecfb219bccc4689cb3cf38e8b2014c).

* [#11969](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/11969) - GoCD Agent on Java 20+ cant talk to server on Java 17
* [#12107](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/12107) - Improve error logging during agent token acquisition failures

#### Security fixes

There are no security fixes included in this release (for issues known to affect GoCD).

However, we regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.

If you use GoCD container images, note that this release rebuilds GoCD images to include
fixes to *curl* [CVE-2023-38545](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html) across all supported platforms.

### 23.3.0

This release is a maintenance release to address a couple of unintended regressions in the 23.2.0 release.

#### Bug fixes

* [#11790](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/11790) - Stage History pagination links are broken on 23.2.0
* [#11783](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/11783) - Build detail timestamp icon is missing on 23.2.0
* [#11797](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/11797) - Some plugin config/report views have missing icons on 23.2.0

#### Security fixes

There are no security fixes included in this release (for issues known to affect GoCD).

However, we regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.

#### APIs

Improvements, deprecations and breaking changes in the API and plugin API have been moved to their respective changelogs
- [API changelog for 23.3.0](https://api.gocd.org/23.3.0/#changes-in-23-3-0) and
[Plugin API changelog for 23.3.0](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/23.3.0/#changes-in-gocd-23-3-0).

### 23.2.0

**NOTE:** An issue was discovered with 23.2.0 which prevents UI navigation via Stage History to older stage runs in
the history when you're already viewing the detail of an individual stage (Stage Details view).
Please upgrade to [23.3.0](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Release+23.3.0%22+is%3Aclosed) instead, which resolves this issue.

---

This release is mainly a maintenance and bug-fix release.

#### Minor changes that may affect plugins

There have been some changes made to GoCD's UI dependencies to improve loading times which may unintentionally affect
certain [plugins](../plugins/)' views. If you notice a visual problem with a plugin view after
updating to 23.2.0, please update to the latest released version of the plugin, and if the issue persists please open an
issue on the plugin's GitHub repository.

A small number of third-party ***community-authored authorization plugins*** may no longer be compatible if they have not
been updated to declare compatibility with the [2.0 extension API](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization)
and still use the outdated extension version 1.0 [deprecated in 2019](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/#changes-in-gocd-19-3-0).
All known popular plugins maintained by the community have been updated, so please update your plugins and open an issue
with the plugin author if you notice a plugin version compatibility error preventing the plugin from loading.

#### GoCD Agent DIND container image start-up is now more conservative

The [GoCD agent "docker-in-docker" image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-docker-dind)
semantics were changed to ensure that the Docker daemon has ***started correctly before starting the
GoCD agent***.

This aligns behavior with the [upstream official docker:dind image](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/tags?page=1&name=dind)
and resolves a race condition in [#11378](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/11378) that can cause docker-related tasks on GoCD agents to fail
due to improvements in GoCD agent work pick-up speed in recent releases.

Prior to GoCD 23.2.0, if the daemon failed to start the agent would continue to work without it. Docker commands within
tasks would fail, however the agent would continue. If you were accidentally relying on this behaviour (e.g due to running
the agent without the ***privileged*** flag, without the appropriate Kubernetes ***securityContext***, or without
mounting the host's ***docker.sock*** into the container correctly), you will need to update your agent start
scripts or elastic agent profile to ensure the daemon has the correct container privileges, OR switch to a non-DIND
agent image such as a [plain Alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.18).

Keep in mind that you only need to use a DIND agent image if you are relying on docker-in-docker or docker-out-of-docker
approaches to build or run nested or sibling containers within your agent host. If you want a drop-in replacement, we
recommend that you use an off-the-shelf GoCD Agent Alpine image, or if you need the Docker CLI (without daemon)
build your own custom child image, augmenting with ***apk add docker-cli*** or similar tooling.

### 23.1.0

#### Dashboard personalization enhancements

Personalized views allowing filters for failed or building stages now also allow inclusion of ***Cancelled*** or ***Paused*** pipelines.

![Personalize Dashboard to show only cancelled or paused pipelines](../assets/images/releases/23.1.0/personalization_config-5bb66d39.png)

#### Yum Repo Poller Plugin no longer bundled by default

Due to both its uncommon use and improvement of agent bootstrap speeds the [Yum/RPM/DNF Repository Poller Plugin](https://docs.gocd.org/current/extension_points/yum_repository_poller.html)
is no longer bundled with GoCD from 23.1.0 onwards.

All [plugins](../plugins/) impose a marginal startup cost for the server and certain plugins also
to all agents. Since it is also currently difficult to override bundled plugins in some GoCD setups, the team have
decided to stop bundling this particular plugin.

If you rely upon this plugin, follow these upgrade steps:

1. download the [latest version of the plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-yum-repository-poller-plugin/releases/latest) from GitHub
2. install the plugin as an *external* plugin (see [plugin user guide](https://docs.gocd.org/current/extension_points/plugin_user_guide.html))
3. upgrade your server to 23.1.0

You needn't worry about:

* *Starting your old server version with the external plugin added*. GoCD will ignore it, and prefer the bundled plugin until you upgrade.
* *Loss of configuration while starting your server on 23.1.0 before adding the plugin back*. Your config will be retained,
  however your server will not function correctly, and certain pipelines will not be editable until you restore the plugin
  and restart your server, which you should do as soon as possible.

As always, we recommend that you [take a backup](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/one_click_backup.html) before upgrading.

#### Security fixes

There are no security fixes included in this release (for issues known to affect GoCD).

This release does upgrade a number of important internal components, some of which were EOL. We do not have evidence that
the previously vulnerable dependencies pose any specific risk in GoCD's usage, however we endeavour to minimise
[dependency drift](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/dependency-drift-fitness-function).

Since we regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.

### 22.1.0

#### Security fixes

This release has **important security fixes** and upgrades to a number of internal components.

This is an especially important upgrade due to two remote code execution vulnerabilities that could allow existing *authenticated
users* with malicious intent to trigger remote code execution on the GoCD Server, within

* the [LDAP Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin)
* use of Mercurial source control materials or configuration repositories

If you are **unable to upgrade immediately**, you can mitigate the high severity issues by

1. removing any [authorization configurations](https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication) for the bundled LDAP Authentication plugin
   * if LDAP login is required, consider migrating your configuration to a patched (`v4.2.0-73`+) version of the [LDAP Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authorization-plugin), which supports both authentication and (optional) authorization
2. uninstalling the `hg`/Mercurial binary from the underlying GoCD Server operating system or Docker image

Security fixes in this release were due to vulnerabilities responsibly disclosed by Alessio Della Libera (of the Snyk Security Team),
Alexey Solovyev (solev9ev) and SuperXX (Xiao Xiong). Many thanks to them for the disclosures, discussions and ideas around mitigation.

#### Java 17 support

This release includes compatibility changes within the GoCD Server to support Java 17.

Java 16+ includes a number of restrictions on access to Java Runtime internals that required either GoCD changes or
specific "opt-outs" to be included in GoCD server's start-up arguments. Currently, there are no opt-outs known
to be required on GoCD agents.

If you use the regular GoCD start-up scripts, and/or the packaged Java Runtime Environments with our installers and/or
Docker images, there is *nothing extra you should need to do to run with Java 16+*.

##### Plugin compatibility with Java 17

GoCD has many plugins and while we have sanity checked many, it is not practical for us to test every plugin.
Plugins are also constrained by these Java Runtime restrictions, and if they either rely on access to Java Runtime
internals or use libraries that do so, they may experience issues.

If you experience issues with a plugin, or GoCD Server or a GoCD Agent

* try working around the issue by following [this guide](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/10265)
* please report the issue, *including a full stack trace* from the logs
  + for plugin issues, on the relevant plugin's GitHub repository (these are linked from the *Author* of each plugin in *Admin -> Plugins*)
  + for GoCD Server/Agent issues, on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues)
* if you are not sure if a plugin or GoCD is at fault, feel free to start a discussion in our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/discussions/new)
  or via [the GoCD Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/go-cd)

### 21.4.0

#### Preparation for Java 17

This release focuses on internal changes, dependency upgrades and build/test automation changes required for GoCD to support Java 17. Since Java 17 is a long-term-support (LTS) release and Java 16 is now end-of-life, we intend to skip specific validation against Java 16.

While we are not quite ready, most required changes are part of the 21.4.0 release, so we expect experimental builds to be made available soon in preparation for a subsequent release.

#### Security Fixes

This release improves GoCD's security posture further by

* correcting a reflected XSS issue on API error responses. Thank you to dmxjon (aka DiMaX) for responsibly disclosing this issue.
* upgrading a number of internal components, some of which have known vulnerabilities.

We do not have evidence that the upgraded dependencies pose any specific risk in GoCD's usage, however we endeavour to minimise [dependency drift](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/dependency-drift-fitness-function).

#### Changes

* [#9828](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9828) - Build the default GoCD Server image on Alpine 3.14
* [#9966](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9966) - Migrate CentOS 8 Agent and Server images to CentOS Stream
* [#9922](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9922) - Base Debian agent images on "slim" variants
* Starting this release, Alpine 3.15 based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.15).
* Starting this release, Debian 11 based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-11).

#### Bug Fixes

* [#9914](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9914) - GoCD Server on MacOS not running with packaged JRE by default
* [#9992](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9992) - Remove broken "more…" link from Job Detail pages

### 21.3.0

#### Security Fixes

This release has **important security fixes** and upgrades to lots of internal components. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version to safeguard your GoCD server.

The [Business Continuity](https://docs.gocd.org/21.2.0/advanced_usage/business_continuity.html) feature has been disabled as a part of these changes. If you are not able to upgrade immediately, please make sure to disable the route `/add-on/business-continuity/*` while you make plans to upgrade.

Security fixes in this release were due to vulnerabilities responsibly disclosed by Simon Scannell, Thomas Chauchefoin, and Paul Gerste of SonarSource. Many thanks to them for the disclosures, discussions and ideas around mitigation.

#### Changes

* All materials URLs for Git, Mercurial, Subversion and TFS materials will now need to start with an alphanumeric character or a `/`. Please open a GitHub issue if this is a problem for you. There is a temporary flag available for this change.
* [#9662](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9662) - Remove "Failures" tab in Job Details page.
* [#9797](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9797) - Build the default GoCD Server image on Alpine 3.13.
* Starting this release, Alpine 3.14 based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.14).
* Starting this release, Ubuntu 20.04 based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-20.04).

#### Upcoming changes

GoCD doesn't yet work with Java 16+. The upgrade to Java 16 requires quite a few changes, which will be attempted in the near future. Given changes in the Java ecosystem (such as Adoptium not providing a JRE any more), we might need to re-think sticking with the latest JVM and maybe consider LTS releases.

### 20.8.0

#### Materials Page

We have introduced a new Materials Page which lists all the configured materials. The page provides an ability to trigger a material update. For each material you can view the modifications with a corresponding link to VSM.

![Materials SPA](../assets/images/releases/20.8.0/materials_spa-3c79018e.gif)
#### Support for Branch and Pull Requests

The GoCD Groovy DSL Configuration Plugin adds support for PR and branches in the [latest version](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-groovy-dsl-config-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0-233) of the plugin. The plugin provides an ability to templatize a pipeline or an entire workflow to run your builds against each branch and PR. Once a template is defined, the plugin scans the configured repository at a regular interval and for each available branch/PR it builds the corresponding pipelines.

Refer to the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-groovy-dsl-config-plugin#support-for-branches-and-prs) for comprehensive examples to use this feature.

#### Stage Overview on Pipeline Activity Page

Staring this release, the users can utilize the stage overview on Pipeline Activity page. Earlier, it was only available on the Dashboard.

### 20.7.0

#### Dashboard Improvements

In this release, there have been significant improvements to the GoCD dashboard UX:

* The GoCD dashboard now provides an ability to trigger manual stages.

![Quick stage overview on dashboard](../assets/images/releases/20.7.0/stage_overview-0e769ece.gif)
#### Other Improvements

* Starting this release, Alpine 3.12 based docker images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.12).

### 20.6.0

#### New Pipeline as code wizard

The Pipeline as code wizard makes it easier for users to define and generate pipeline definitions using the config repo plugin of their choice.

![Pipeline as code wizard](../assets/images/releases/20.6.0/pipeline_as_code_wizard-f66fe5df.png)
#### SSL support - Breaking Changes

In GoCD 20.2.0 we had [announced](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7872) the removal of support for TLS on port 8154 using a self-signed certificate. To minimize disruptions, GoCD temporarily provided an option to enable the TLS port.

With this release, GOCD no longer supports configuring TLS within GoCD and will stop bringing up TLS on port 8154. If you have temporarily enabled TLS, and if the agents are configured to use the TLS port 8154 they will have to reconfigured to use port 8153, else the agent will stop connecting to the server.

#### Business Continuity

GoCD had a failover mechanism to decrease the impact of server failure. This feature was available as part of the paid offering through the Business Continuity Addon.
As part of open sourcing all the commercial components, the Business continuity feature has been incorporated into GoCD core. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/20.6.0/advanced_usage/business_continuity/introduction.html) to know more about the Business Continuity feature.

#### Data Sharing

The Data Sharing feature has been removed from GoCD.

### 20.5.0

#### Support for multiple databases

GoCD 20.5.0, while continuing to use H2 as the default database, introduces support for PostgreSQL without a need for the (previously used) commercial addon. As part of these changes GoCD moved away from using the unmaintained dbdeploy to liquibase for automated database migrations. These changes require a one-time manual migration of the GoCD database running on versions <= 20.4.0 to one compliant with GoCD 20.5.0 and beyond, even if you decide not to migrate to PostgreSQL.

Please refer to [the GoCD Database migration document](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/upgrading_go/upgrade_to_gocd_20.5.0.html) for steps to migrate your database.

#### UI/UX refresh

As part of the ongoing UI/UX refresh for improving the user experience, the Templates Authorization page has been rewritten to keep it in sync with other pages, while retaining existing functionality.

### 19.11.0

**Issue with Environment Variables of Environment**: There is a known issue with GoCD release v19.11.0: [Github issue #7481](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7481) causing the secure environment variables defined in an environment not to be persisted on the server. There is a GoCD release v19.12.0, which fixes this issue. It is recommended to use 19.12.0 (or above) installers.

Users on GoCD release v19.11.0 are recommended to use the alternatives mentioned as part of the [Github Comment](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7481#issuecomment-567906013) to avoid this issue.

Updated: Monday 23 DEC at 11:00:00 UTC 2019
#### Role Based Access Control

Traditionally, a Role in GoCD is a group of users. With this release, we are enhancing the purpose of Roles. Roles can now be used to control the access of different entities in GoCD, which earlier were accessible only by System Administrators.

System Adminstrators can configure permissions for a given role using policies at a granular level. This release adds support to configure access to environments, support for more entities will be added in subsequent releases.

Read the GoCD Policy [documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/19.11.0/configuration/policy_in_gocd.html) for more details.

#### UI/UX refresh

### 19.10.0

#### Database cleanup

Please make sure that a GoCD server backup is taken before upgrading to 19.10.0.

There are some unnecessary data in the GoCD database which will be removed upon the first server start after upgrading to 19.10.0.
This cleanup will be done only for completed jobs and will remove historical data related to environment variables, artifact plans, resources and job-related metadata.
This will not affect any information in GoCD's configuration file.

Depending on the size of your database, you may experience some delay during startup while the data is being removed from the database. Please do not kill the GoCD server until the database upgrade completes.
If you do end up killing it, you might need to restore the database from the backup taken before this upgrade.

* `[7d5d01f](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7d5d01f55320d7d70ec80d4af646120635842f61)` - Delete cruft from the DB for jobs that are completed.

#### Improved Agents page

Agents page has been improved in this release. Now it will have 2 tabs - Static and Elastic - for easy viewing and searching of static and elastic agents.

![New Agents page - Static agents](../assets/images/releases/19.10.0/new-agents-page-static-agents-36c50ab2.png)

![New Agents page - Elastic agents](../assets/images/releases/19.10.0/new-agents-page-elastic-agents-4ff88a93.png)
#### Optional upstream dependencies

Introduced `ignore_for_scheduling` flag at the pipeline dependency level to improve GoCD's ability to model pipelines, as described in [this issue](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4931).
This flag allows run of an upstream pipeline to be ignored by the downstream pipeline.
This is useful in cases where a downstream pipeline has multiple materials and wants to have fine-grained control over which materials cause it to run. Previously, this was available only for SCM materials (like git, mercurial, etc). This flag is available on the material edit page, Pipeline Config API and the bundled JSON/YAML config repo plugins.

#### Other Improvements

* Starting this release, CentOS 8 based images for GoCD Agent are [available](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-8)

### 19.9.0

#### Support for Java 8 and 10 removed

Support for Java 8 and 10 has been dropped from this release. This is in line with our [official stance on Java](https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/21/official-stance-on-java/) we announced earlier this year post the Java Licensing Changes.

Starting 19.9.0, GoCD Server and Agent would only support Java 11 or 12. Support for Java 13 will be introduced soon. GoCD installers from 19.6.0 come with Java Runtime pre-bundled, so users no longer need to install it separately.

Users might need to upgrade the GoCD Agent Bootstrapper. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/7007)

#### Other Improvements

* [#911](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/911) - Moved agent configuration out of the main xml configuration.
* [#6919](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6919) - Improve performance of artifact download and digesting.

#### Bug fixes

* `[4c54c9b](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/4c54c9b5fcc0fe0f47f014b062d7644eac6b1b32)` - Fix git failure on CentOS 7 based GoCD agent docker images.
* [#6918](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6918) - Error on opening on job details in the absence of cluster profile

### 19.8.0

#### New Pipeline Creation Wizard

We have introduced a new simplified pipeline creation wizard as part of our ongoing UI/UX refresh for improving the user experience.

Feedback/ideas are welcome, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues) to add your comments.

![New Pipeline Creation Wizard](../assets/images/releases/19.8.0/new-pipeline-wizard-b98bde85.gif)
#### Introduce support for latest API version

GoCD’s APIs are versioned. Accessing an API endpoint requires providing a version number as part of the `Accept` header. GoCD now allows accessing the latest version of an API by omitting the version number in the header. For instance, you can use `Accept: application/vnd.go.cd+json` instead of `Accept: application/vnd.go.cd.v3+json`. More information can be found on [GitHub issue #6620](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6620).

#### Ability to trigger a stage only if the previous stage has succeeded

Introduced the attribute `allowOnlyOnSuccess` for `approval` at stage level. If the attribute is set to `true`, the stage can be manually triggered only if the previous stage (if there is one) has resulted in success. More information can be found on [GitHub issue #6294](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6294).

#### Java 8 and 10 deprecation

Support for Java 8 and 10 will be removed in the next release of GoCD. GoCD installers come with Java Runtime pre-bundled, so users no longer need to install it separately.
The removal of Java versions is in line with the Java Licensing Changes we had announced earlier this year in this [blog post](https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/21/official-stance-on-java/).

Updated: Friday 06 SEP at 07:25:00 UTC 2019
#### Secrets Management

We have enhanced support for managing secrets in GoCD. GoCD now provides an ability to refer to secrets defined in an external Secret Manager. With this, apart from referring to secrets, users can manage permissions for these secrets and rotate them without any changes to GoCD configuration.

Support for Secrets Management is provided using plugins. We have introduced a new secrets extension using which plugin authors can write a plugin to support a Secret Manager of their choice. We have built a File based Secret Management plugin which is bundled along with GoCD.

Please refer to the [Secret Management Documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/19.6.0/configuration/secrets_management.html) for more information.

![Secret Management SPA](../assets/images/releases/19.6.0/secret-config-spa-cda210eb.gif)
#### GoCD Installer Changes

There is some variation in how GoCD server and agents across multiple different operating systems and installer types need to be managed by system admins. To reduce the maintenance overhead and cognitive load, all the installers have undergone varying degrees of changes.

If you are an existing GoCD user upgrading from an older version of GoCD, please read [about the changes](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6627) before performing an upgrade. Users installing GoCD for the first time should not be affected.
#### Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root

Starting from this release, GoCD containers run as non-root user, by default. The Dockerized GoCD application will run as `go:root` (`uid:1000`, `gid:0`) user instead of running as `root:root` (`uid:0`, `gid:0`). For more information, checkout [Running Dockerized GoCD Containers as Non Root](https://www.gocd.org/2019/06/25/GoCD-non-root-containers/) blog post.

#### Simpler HTTP authentication for agent-server communication

Historically, GoCD agent server communication required SSL/TLS mutual authentication using X509 certificates. GoCD version 19.6 disables mutual TLS by default. This will allow GoCD administrators to terminate agent-server communication at load balancers or reverse proxies.

To turn on the old behavior and enable mutual TLS, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` to `false`.

#### Versions of Java this release of GoCD works with

* Java 8 (Deprecated)

### 19.5.0

#### Replacing X.509 with simpler HTTPs token-based authentication for Agent-Server Communication - Beta feature

This is a beta feature: agent-server commnication can be toggled to use token-based authentication instead of self-signed X.509 certificates from the GoCD server.
To enable token-based auth, set the environment variable `GO_USE_TOKEN_AUTH` on the GoCD agent to `true`.

With token-based authentication enabled, agents can use load balancers or reverse proxy DNS names and not GoCD server DNS/IP. It is also not required to expose port 8154 on the GoCD server. TLS termination can happen at the reverse proxy instead.

#### Other Improvements

* [#6299](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/6299) - A new request has been added to the plugin API endpoint to allow elastic agent plugins to [log messages to the job console](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/elastic-agents/#log-messages-to-job-console).

#### Bug fixes

* [#6278](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6278) - All rails APIs return strong Etag.
* [#6337](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6337) - Start Docker deamon process for dind image.
* [#6325](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/6325) - Supress warnings thrown in server logs when a user visits job console of jobs either not assigned or not started writing to console.

### 19.4.0

#### Improved Git and Mercurial material configurations

Introduced `username` and `password` (or `encryptedPassword`) attributes on Git and Mercurial materials. Users can now use these fields to setup credentials in a secure manner, instead of putting credentials in the URL. The YAML, JSON and Groovy config repo [plugins](../plugins/) have been updated to allow these additional fields on material definitions.

Users can also utilize the newly introduced `branch` attribute on Mercurial materials to specify the branch instead of specifying in the URL.

Users are advised to move their credentials from the URLs into these attributes. This allows passwords to be encrypted and stored in the configuration.

Changing the material configuration will be treated as a new material for the corresponding pipeline, which in turn will trigger the pipeline.
#### Introduced support for Java 12

Starting this release, GoCD has now added support for Java 12. All the docker images and installers for Windows and OSX are bundled with a supported version of Java (not necessarily 12).

Please refer to this [blog post](https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/21/official-stance-on-java/) for our official stance on supported Java versions going forward.

### 19.3.0

#### Multi-cluster support for Elastic Agent

Now elastic agent can be created in different cluster based on the cluster profile. Elastic Profiles SPA is updated to reflect cluster profiles and elastic agent profiles.

![Cluster Support](../assets/images/releases/19.3.0/elastic_profile-51501be1.png)

To know more about about Cluster Profiles click [here](https://docs.gocd.org/19.3.0/configuration/elastic_agents.html#concepts).

Introduced elastic agent extension v5 to support cluster profiles. For more info refer Elastic Agent Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/19.3.0/elastic-agents/#elastic-agents).

Upgrade instructions: In order to perform a graceful upgrade, it's advised to use the [maintenance mode](https://docs.gocd.org/19.3.0/advanced_usage/maintenance_mode.html) to make sure that all running elastic agent jobs have finished, before upgrading to 19.3.0 or a later release of GoCD. If not, you might need to cancel any previously started elastic agent jobs after the upgrade.
#### Improved Backup SPA

SPA is updated to show real-time progress of your GoCD server backup.

![Backup SPA](../assets/images/releases/19.3.0/backup-2504b1e5.png)

### 19.2.0

#### Access Tokens

We have introduced support for personal access tokens. GoCD users can now generate tokens through the application or the Access Token API and use them to access the GoCD APIs rather than passing their username & password. The tokens inherit the privileges of the user who created them.

Personal Access Token:

### 19.1.0

#### GoCD Maintenance mode

GoCD maintenance mode can be utilized by the GoCD system administrator to safely restart or upgrade the GoCD server without having any running jobs reschedule when the server is back up. Initiating maintenance mode will cause various sub-systems of GoCD to stop working making sure server is not performing any operation.

![Maintenance Mode Feature](../assets/images/releases/19.1.0/server-maintenance-mode-9b7eb7ce.gif)

To know more about about GoCD Maintenance Mode click [here](https://docs.gocd.org/19.1.0/advanced_usage/maintenance_mode.html).

#### Improved Pipeline as Code experience.

Continuing on the road towards improving GoCD's pipelines as code / config repositories experience, this release introduces the ability to export a GoCD pipeline to a format which can be used by the config repository plugins (for instance, YAML or JSON plugins). You can then check in these pipeline definitions to a repository and remove them from GoCD's config.

![Pipeline Export Feature](../assets/images/releases/19.1.0/pipeline-export-111479b7.gif)

* In this release, users with ~100 or above agents will see a significant performance improvement on the agents page and when invoking the agents API. In 18.10, due to upgrading some libraries to support Java 9 (and beyond) there were some performance regressions with the agents page (and the agents API).
* `[451cef0](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/451cef0fb5c018f8d0f76565cf473e5cd7819ea9)` - Improve performance of some pipeline lookups in the database by removing a cast operation.
* `[dcf69b0](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/dcf69b053bbc3ba7729fc3a29c515ff76a4ac960)` - Do not lookup pipelines by both label and counter, prefer a counter. ([#5256](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/5256))
* `[f0d1a6e](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/f0d1a6e6b46f9c342a698b9e9c0fdd8e8d21e47e)` - Use byte arrays (instead of strings) to represent the config XML. This improves performance of some of the admin pages and also quickly renders large configuration XML.

#### New APIs

Introduced APIs to

* [Run/rerun a stage](https://api.gocd.org/18.11.0/#run-stage).
* [Run failed jobs](https://api.gocd.org/18.11.0/#run-failed-jobs) in a stage
* [Run selected jobs](https://api.gocd.org/18.11.0/#run-selected-jobs) in a stage

#### Bug fixes

* `[ad87a7c](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/ad87a7c4dce5027a143eff554c102d64e8f3ce38)` - Ensure that the GoCD server health check API returns an HTTP 200 OK status code when backup is in progress. ([#5416](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/5416))

* `[13be966](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/13be966d353818be2c56ad00be16661e5257263d)` - Re-enable pipeline operation buttons on dashboard if pipeline trigger fails. ([#5153](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/5153))

#### Docker Images

We have added support for the GoCD agents for [Fedora-28](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-fedora-28) and [Fedora-29](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-fedora-29).

#### Deprecations

* With the introduction of AES for encryption/decryption in release 18.7.0, we are deprecating support for DES. Support for DES is retained to support DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos and will be available till the last release of GoCD for the year 2018. The [Encryption API](https://api.gocd.org/18.8.0/#encryption) is updated to return an AES cipher-text and users are encouraged to update their DES cipher-texts in config-repos using this API.
* The elastic agent plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for job completion request. The docker, docker swarm, kubernetes and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.
* The notification plugin extension version 3 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 4 of the notification plugin api.
* The analytics plugin extension version 1 has been deprecated. This version will be removed in a release scheduled for Mar 2019. Plugin developers should use version 2 of the analytics plugin api.

#### Breaking Changes

* The alpine 3.5 based docker image for [GoCD agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5/) has been removed since alpine 3.5 has reached end of life.
* The Template Config API v3 has been removed. [Version 4](https://api.gocd.org/18.8.0/#template-config) of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* The Pipeline Config API v5 has been removed. [Version 6](https://api.gocd.org/18.8.0/#pipeline-config) of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* The [Feeds API for getting a Stage](https://api.gocd.org/18.11.0/#get-stage) no longer supports the `pipeline_label` URL parameter. Users should use the `pipeline_counter` parameter instead.

### 18.10.0

#### Support for Java 10 and 11

While we continue to support Java 8, GoCD has now added support for Java 10 and 11. With Oracle moving towards a 6 month cadence for newer releases we are evaluating the process to keep in sync with the new cadence. Watch this space for more information in the coming releases.

#### Environments Page

Originally the `Environments` page grouped the pipelines by environment with an option for admins to edit the environment. With the introduction of the new pipeline dashboard users have an option to group the pipelines by `Pipeline Group` or `Environment`.

With this release we have moved the environments page under the Admin tab. This page lists all the configured environments with an option to edit them.

![Environments page moved under Admin tab](../assets/images/releases/18.10.0/environments-under-admin-e89c15f6.gif)
#### Elastic Agent Extension V4

### 18.9.0

#### Backups on a schedule

This release allows performing a backup on schedule. GoCD now allows executing a script once the backup completes. This feature removes the need for GoCD administrators to execute and monitor custom "cron-like" jobs to ensure that backups are completed.

For example: Users can now add the following snippet to the config XML to perform a backup once a night at 10pm on weekdays and call the `/usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3 script` after the backup is done:

```
<server>
  ...
  <backup schedule="0 0 22 ? * MON-FRI"
          postBackupScript="/usr/local/bin/upload-to-s3"
          emailOnSuccess="false"
          emailOnFailure="true"/>
</server>

```
#### Analytics Extension V2

Upgraded the Analytics Extension to [Version 2](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.9.0/analytics). This version adds support for showing analytics on the Agents and Value Stream Map(VSM) page.

#### Notification Extension V4

[Version 4](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.9.0/notifications) of the Notification Extension enchances the existing Stage Status notification message to include the material fingerprint. It also provides details of previous stage(if any) responsible for triggering the current stage.

#### Bug fixes

* `[8e0966d](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8e0966da1ca321d609fb7379c7d256425951a1a7)` - Fixed scroll behaviour of filter tabs on the dashboard when navigating using the tabs dropdown. ([#5097](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/5097))

### 18.8.0

#### Flexible & Personalized Dashboard

We have made several improvements to the pipeline view on the new dashboard to make it more personal and relevant to our users.

**Group pipelines either by pipeline groups or environments**

![grouping by environment or pipeline group name](../assets/images/releases/18.8.0/dashboard-grouping-18748d18.gif)

**Create personalizations based on your preference**

![create new personalization view](../assets/images/releases/18.8.0/create-new-view-cf4e737f.gif)

**Make views more relevant by showing only those pipelines that are building or failed**

![show only building and failed pipelines](../assets/images/releases/18.8.0/by-pipeline-status-898e5dee.gif)

**Re-order views to your liking**

![reorder views](../assets/images/releases/18.8.0/reorder-views-c7beeb90.gif)

#### Accessibility Improvements

We have made some [accessibility improvements](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4165) which makes it easier for people
using screenreaders to use the new dashboard.

#### Data Sharing Update

As of this release (18.8), GoCD collects information regarding jobs run by elastic agents and pipelines added through config repo. These metrics help us gauge the effectiveness of the pipeline as code feature and elastic agent plugins.

![Data Sharing](../assets/images/releases/18.8.0/data-sharing-721f77da.png)

#### New APIs

* [#4936](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4936) - Introduced an API to configure [GoCD system admin users](https://api.gocd.org/current/#system-admins).

#### Performance Improvements

* [#4965](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4965) - Improve performance of config saves when config repositories are configured.

#### Breaking changes

* GoCD is no longer an OAuth provider. This integration was primarily used for integration with Mingle and the commercial business-continuity addon. Users who have been using GoCD's OAuth provider for the commercial business-continuity addon should read the business-continuity release notes before upgrading their GoCD servers.

#### Bug fixes

* `[d5fd967](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/d5fd967f7ccfcc664f2b8d6f2825304637e24c4e)` - Fetch artifact task should support `./` as source directory for backward compatability. ([#4810](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4810))

### 18.7.0

#### External Artifacts

Introduced support for publishing and fetching artifacts from an external artifacts store.

* We have introduced a new [Artifacts Plugin Extension](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.7.0/artifacts/) for plugin authors to write plugins which support artifact stores of their choice.
* Introduced Artifact Plugin for [Docker Registry](https://github.com/gocd/docker-registry-artifact-plugin) to store and fetch docker images from the docker registry.

#### Better encryption

We have moved towards using AES for encryption/decryption over DES. All DES cipher-text in cruise-config.xml will be migrated to AES cipher-text. Support for DES is retained to handle DES cipher-texts configured in config-repos. DES encryption is deprecated, check the deprecation notes for more details.

#### Data Sharing

GoCD now shares some (non-personally identifiable) information about the instance, to help improve the experience and performance. All GoCD system administrators will see a notification message about it and will have a chance to review the information sent and make a decision about it.

![GoCD Data Sharing](../assets/images/releases/18.7.0/data-sharing-ae8581cb.png)
#### New Loading... screen

The GoCD server now starts up into a "Loading …" screen early on in the process. So, if you have scripts waiting on the port to be open, instead use the [server health API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#server-health), which will succeed with an HTTP status of 200 once the server is up. Till then, it'll fail with an HTTP status of 503.

![Loading Screen](../assets/images/releases/18.7.0/loading-screen-d4d02113.png)
#### API Improvements

* `[26cc0ec](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/26cc0ec092a555574f6d9e653f46fc3981416125)` - Introduced [Pipeline Config API V6](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pipeline-config) to support external artifact config. ([#4760](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4760)).

### 18.4.0

Previously, there was a warning about not upgrading to 18.4. In 18.5, an issue around pipelines created using the pipeline config API showing twice on the dashboard was fixed. We haven't been able to replicate issue [#4723](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4723) around pipelines created using JSON and YAML plugins, we suspect it might be an issue with the individual's setup. [Updated: 2018 May 11, 11:45 UTC]

#### Performance fix

This release primarily addresses performance issue caused by a config save, which slows down several requests because of a long-running database query executed in order to update the dashboard.

We have performed some optimizations in order to significantly reduce the number of SQL calls executed. Read more about it at [#4706](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4706) and [#4705](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4705).

#### Improvements

* [#4664](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4664) - Improved logging on GoCD server when agent registration fails.
* [#4610](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4610) - Add an origin attribute on fetch task. The origin attribute indicates where to fetch the artifact from. For all artifacts fetched from the gocd server, the value is 'gocd'
* [#4630](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4630) - Upgrade jetty to version 9.4.9.

#### Bug fixes

* [#4675](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4675) - Server side timestamps are rendered properly when daylight saving is in effect.
* [#4691](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4691) - Allow logged in users to access [PluginInfos API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info).
* [#4673](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4673) - Allow `null` environment variable value in config repo plugins.
* [#3908](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3908) - Allow admin to change selected user in the User summary page.
* [#4690](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4690) - Fixed some issues with case-insensitive renames of pipeline names.
* [#4698](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4698) - Do not truncate long pipeline name.
* [#4682](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4682) - Do not send a HTTP basic authentication challenge for API requests sent by the browser over AJAX.

#### Bundled plugins

* Upgraded the bundled LDAP authentication plugin to version 1.0.2. See the [plugin CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.
* Upgraded the bundled file based authentication plugin to version 1.0.2. See the [plugin CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 18.2.0 the following (unversioned) APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018:
  + The pipeline [pause api](https://api.gocd.org/18.1.0/#pause-a-pipeline).
  + The pipeline [unpause api](https://api.gocd.org/18.1.0/#unpause-a-pipeline).
  + The pipeline [unlock api](https://api.gocd.org/18.1.0/#releasing-a-pipeline-lock).
  + The pipeline [schedule api](https://api.gocd.org/18.1.0/#scheduling-pipelines).

  These APIs have been replaced with a versioned API and users are encouraged to use these instead.
* The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been deprecated as part of 18.2.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Version 5 of the pipeline config API has been introduced to add the new pipeline unlock behavior attribute ([#3943](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3943)).
* The elastic agent plugin extension version 1 and (a development verion 2) has been deprecated. These versions will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report.

* The [Plugin Info API](https://api.gocd.org/18.2.0/#plugin-info) v3 has been deprecated as part of 18.3.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for July 2018. Version 4 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

#### Breaking changes

* The [Agent Docker Image for Debian 7](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-7) will not be built with newer version of GoCD. Users wanting to build a gocd agent image for debian 7 can fork [the repository](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-7) to build an image.

#### Known Issues

* There are a few known minor issues when triggering pipelines on the new dashboard:
  + [#4647](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4647) - Trigger buttons do not get disabled if the pipeline was force triggered and material update is in progress
  + [#4452](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4452) - Horizontal scroll appears in Trigger With Options Materials popup
  + [#4481](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4481) - CCTray corner cases: NullPointerException because of a pipeline not being in the config when the dashboard looks to update itself.

### 18.3.0

#### New Dashboard Page out of Beta

After we released the improved GoCD Dashboard (beta) in 18.2.0, we made several bug fixes and performance improvements based on feedback from our users. The GoCD dashboard improves performance for large GoCD instances with thousands of pipelines. In 18.3.0, we have replaced the older version of the dashboard with this improved dashboard which will be available as the default option to all GoCD users.

![new dashboard page](../assets/images/releases/18.3.0/new-dashboard-dd0bd431.png)
#### Enhancements to GoCD's Plugin Architecture

We have been working on a few improvements to our plugin architecture.

**Support for adding plugin alerts to GoCD's Errors and Warnings section:**
GoCD provides an [ability for plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications/#add-server-health-messages) to add Error and Warning messages. These messages will show up along with the GoCD's own Errors and Warnings. Plugins now have an ability to notify users with any plugin error or warning messages which shows up in GoCD.

![Errors and Warnings from Plugins](../assets/images/releases/18.3.0/plugin-error-warning-messages-0bbd0095.png)

**Multiple Extension Support for Plugins:**
Plugins can now implement [multiple extensions](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-multi-extension-plugin-example). This will allow plugin developers to create a single plugin to support multiple extensions which complement each other. E.g This would allow one to write a new GitHub PR workflow plugin with both SCM and Notification extensions.

The plugin info API v4 has been introduced to represent plugins which implement multiple extensions. The two changes are:

* "type" is no longer at plugin level. It's at an extension level.
* "extension\_info" was an attribute. It's now a list called "extensions".

**Notification Extension V3:**
Introduced [Version 3](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications) of Notification Extension. This version adds a new message to [notify agent state](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/18.3.0/notifications/#agent-status-changed) changes.

**Analytics Extension Point:**
There is a new analytics extension point which allows analytics to be embedded into GoCD. We are continuing to work on it and you'll hear more about it soon.

#### Docker Images

A new Docker image GoCD Agent is available for [Debian 9](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-9).

#### Improvements

* [#4644](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4644) - Environments page no longer lists the pipeline instances, this page is only for listing the available environments and editing them.
* [#4617](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4617) - Ability to turn-off logging of JVM-args and Environment variables to STDERR on GoCD Agent and Server startup.
* [#4607](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4607) - Remove flash filter from agent remoting endpoint
* [#4278](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4278) - Change in Build and Test Artifact XML representation
* [#4559](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4559) - Upgraded Objenesis library to fix performance issues around object cloning.
* [#4557](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4557) - Plugin settings api improvements
* [#4435](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4435) - Add the blacklist textarea to other scm materials in the pipeline creation wizard
* [#4432](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4432) - Setting up one listener per notification plugin to avoid one plugin interfering with others
* [#4521](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4521) - Update config-repo yaml plugin to 0.6.2

#### Bug fixes

* [#4656](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4656) - Serialise lastBuildTime for CCTray in UTC with timezone
* [#4466](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4466) - Make JSON output invalid on error
* [#4569](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4569) - Update mail sender with mailhost config every time while performing backup.
* [#4474](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4474) - Fixed issue with SPAs popping up a login dialog after session timeout
* [#4542](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4542) - Fix plugin logging concurrency issue
* [#4496](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4496) - Show only pipelines that the user has admin permissions to extract a template.
* [#4501](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4501) - Ensure cancelled stage has lastTransitionedTime.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 18.2.0 the following (unversioned) APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018:
  + The pipeline [pause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pause-a-pipeline)
  + The pipeline [unpause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#unpause-a-pipeline)
  + The pipeline [unlock api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#releasing-a-pipeline-lock)
  + The pipeline [schedule api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#scheduling-pipelines)

  These APIs have been replaced with a versioned API and users are encouraged to use these instead.
* The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been deprecated as part of 18.2.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Version 5 of the pipeline config API has been introduced to add the new pipeline unlock behavior attribute ([#3943](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3943)).
* The elastic agent plugin extension version 1 and (a development verion 2) has been deprecated. These versions will be removed in a release scheduled for June 2018. Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report. The docker, docker swarm, and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.
* The [Plugin Info API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) v3 has been deprecated as part of 18.3.0. This version of the API will be removed in a release scheduled for July 2018. Version 4 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* The [Agent Docker Image for Debian 7](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-7) is deprecated as part of 18.3.0 and will be removed in a release scheduled for May 2018. Users should upgrade to a [newer version](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent-debian-9) of the Debian image.

#### Breaking changes

* The [old plugins page](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4226) which was deprecated in 18.2.0 has been removed

#### Known Issues

* There are a few known minor issues when triggering pipelines on the new dashboard:
  + [#4647](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4647) - Trigger buttons do not get disabled if the pipeline was force triggered and material update is in progress
  + [#4452](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4452) - Horizontal scroll appears in Trigger With Options Materials popup
  + [#4481](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4481) - CCTray corner cases: NullPointerException because of a pipeline not being in the config when the dashboard looks to update itself.
* There is a known issue with API authentication:

  API requests that wait for a authentication challenge before sending the credentials in the `Authorization` header fail with `401`.
  This is due to a bug introduced in the pull request [#4585](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/4585) - 'SPAs - redirect to login page if unauthorized'.
  The bug essentially responded with a `401` http response before the `WWW-Authenticate` header could be added. More details can be found in the github issue [#4682](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4682).

### 18.2.0

#### New Dashboard Page (Beta)

![new dashboard page](../assets/images/releases/18.2.0/new-dashboard-4720d938.png)
New Dashboard Page

This release of GoCD ships with a 'preview' version of the new dashboard page (can be accessed using **'/go/dashboard'**). This improves performance for large GoCD instances with thousands of pipelines. It does so by:

* keeping track of the state of the dashboard in memory (instead of being pulled from the DB).
* rendering the response as a JSON (instead of HTML). This improves the rendering time by several hundred times on the server.
* a javascript based frontend that is several thousand times faster on large instances, reducing the CPU usage of your browser. Your laptop battery will thank you. :)
* reduces the polling rate when the dashboard is shown in a browser tab that is hidden.

> Please report any issues that you observe on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues). This new dashboard will replace the existing dashboard in one of the upcoming releases of GoCD.

This feature can be turned off by executing:

```
curl https://your-go-server/go/api/admin/feature_toggles/quicker_dashboard_key \
  -d toggle_value=off \
  -H 'Confirm:true' \
  -u username:password

```
#### Elastic Agent Status Report

To make it easier to see information about your elastic agent and check logs in case of issues, elastic agent plugins can now provide an elastic agent status report. This report is available from the agents page, and from the job detail page. Docker, Docker Swarm, and Amazon ECS plugins implement this status report feature.

#### Elastic Agent Plugin Status Report

Elastic Agent Plugin Status Report

To make it easier to see information about elastic agent cluster, elastic agent plugins can provide a report about all running agents and the state of the cluster. This report is available from the plugins page. Docker, Docker Swarm, and Amazon ECS plugins implement this status report feature.

#### API Improvements

* `[612c66a](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/612c66ac50c24c53fc2db7400386d14faafbd87b)` - Introduction of pipeline [pause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pause-a-pipeline) and [unpause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#unpause-a-pipeline). ([#4076](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4076)).

  The old pause/unpause APIs have been deprecated and users should upgrade to the new API.
* `[b52aff7](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/b52aff7071e0c91d3048b16bcadb63f703ae2495)` - Introduction of pipeline unlock [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#releasing-a-pipeline-lock). ([#4237](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4237)).

  The old pipeline unlock API has been deprecated and users should upgrade to the new API.
* `[666b206](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/666b20667e0e3df1834e7e8a339bd1d527db545b)` - Introduction of pipeline schedule [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#scheduling-pipelines). ([#4319](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4319)).

  The old pipeline schedule API has been deprecated and users should upgrade to the new API.
* `[6dfa18f](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6dfa18fe9bc7cd315ec2db964980a0a0b00d9dd2)` - Introduction of server health messages [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#server-health-messages). ([#4256](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4256)).

  This endpoint will render the warnings and errors that were earlier visible only when clicking on the "errors and warnings" modal on the GoCD server
* `[0353bb6](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/0353bb6881e314bf08597967d6185bb66f7ddbab)` - Introduction of Template Authorization [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#update-template-authorization). ([#3081](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3081)).
* `[9c4829e](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/9c4829e87ec47fd835579d0dc2779233c7b00330)` - Support `gitlab@` urls for gitlab webhooks. ([#4211](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4211))

  Many GitLab installations use `gitlab@` as a git user. This was once a default user for GitLab installs. Due to this the urls for ssh connections from gitlab can include this user.

#### Improvements

* Introduce environment variables `GO_MATERIAL_HAS_CHANGED` and `GO_MATERIAL_${material name or dest}_HAS_CHANGED` to indicate if materials have changed from the previous pipeline run, and if materials have changed, which materials have changed. Read more about these variables in the [help documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/current/faq/dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html#standard-gocd-environment-variables).

#### Docker images

We have introduced the GoCD Agent Docker in Docker image. This can be used to run the docker related tasks such as building a docker image, pushing to a registry etc. Advanced use-cases include containerizing the application and running tests using DInD.

Read more about changes with docker images for the [server docker image](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [agent docker image](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

#### Bug fixes

* With the introduction of the server health messages API, we can now show server health messages on some of the pages introduced in the last several releases, viz. roles, authorization configuration, agents, elastic profiles, plugin settings.
* [#3899](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3899) - Fixed an infinite redirect issue when logging in using web based authentication plugins
* [#3926](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3926) - Handle console logs better with utf-8 encoding
* `[157f12d](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/157f12d46b0eedc35b7d4be147caf77590aeac41)` - Enforce `http(s)` URL scheme for tracking tools. ([#4356](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4356))

  This will add an `http://` prefix to tracking tool links that do not start with `http://` or `https://`.
* The plugin settings request is supported for the SCM and Package repository extensions on the plugins SPA. The plugin settings that can be configured for scm and package repo plugins are made use of *only* on the server side.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 18.2 the following (unversioned) APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in 18.5 (scheduled to be released in May 2018):
  + The pipeline [pause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pause-a-pipeline)
  + The pipeline [unpause api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#unpause-a-pipeline)
  + The pipeline [unlock api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#releasing-a-pipeline-lock)
  + The pipeline [schedule api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#scheduling-pipelines)

  These APIs have been replaced with a versioned API and users are encouraged to use these instead.
* The pipeline config API version 3 and version 4 have been deprecated and will be removed in 18.5 (scheduled to be released in May 2018). Version 5 of the pipeline config API has been introduced to add the new pipeline unlock behavior attribute ([#3943](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3943)).
* The elastic agent api version 1 and (a development verion 2) has been deprecated. These versions will be removed in 18.5 (scheduled to be released in May 2018). Plugin developers should use version 3 of the elastic agent plugin api to allow adding support for agent status report and plugin status report. The docker, docker swarm, and ecs plugins have been migrated to the new versions, and users should upgrade their plugins to the latest version to see these new features.
* Plugins upload form has been removed from the new plugins page. It is still available in the old plugins page, which will be removed in release 18.3.0 (scheduled to be released in March 2018).

#### Breaking changes

* Version 1 of the [users api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#users) has been removed. Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

#### Known issues

* There are a few known issues when triggering pipelines using the trigger with options feature on the new dashboard:
  + [#4488](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4488) - If for a material no revision selected on trigger with options, schedules with latest revision
  + [#4489](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4489) - If invalid revision specified do not trigger pipeline
  + [#4448](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4448) - Pipeline with lock behavior specified continues to be locked after run completion under certain conditions

  As a part of an ongoing UI/UX refresh, we have introduced the new plugins page:

![Plugins SPA](../assets/images/releases/17.12.0/Plugins-SPA-73593efd.png)
#### Other Improvements

* `[0ee52b3](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/0ee52b367080b758847613c21701c11895e8ba4a)` - Disallow an authenticated user from re-authentication. ([#3940](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3940))

  With this change, an authenticated user is re-directed to home page on trying to access the login page.
* `[6fda2f5](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6fda2f5cb5104b9394f2cfd5e41ca1e517078bd6)` - Add new unlock behavior. ([#3943](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3943)) [#106](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/106)

  As a part of this change, two types of locking behavior are introduced:

  + Run single instance of pipeline at a time ("Lock behavior: Unlock when finished")
  + Run single instance of pipeline and lock on failure ("Lock behavior: Lock on failure")

  More information can be found in the [docs](https://docs.gocd.org/17.12.0/configuration/admin_lock_pipelines.html).

#### Bug Fixes

* `[ab1ccf8](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/ab1ccf83aa90dfa3fc916ca892592e6db81717fc)` - Fix config file validation to not use file system to validate paths. This caused issues in certain cases where the server working directories were using symlinks. ([#4026](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4026)) [#3984](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3984)
* `[6660a1b](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6660a1b093d1c265f697c6e0ee16d3c146772a24)` - Show 'console log not available' error in build details page's console tab when console.log file is not available. ([#3998](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3998)) [#3773](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3773) [#3650](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3650)
* `[e48d958](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/e48d9588988969c42c2f63b617cd9d08f8ca015d)` - Fixes console.log file not being available at server if websocket connection is closed while waiting for logs.

* `[ee992e6](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/ee992e6175497a3ae927c9e956e22d822e5715bd)` - Fixes issue in agent zip installers in which agents fail to register if their log directories' path have spaces in them. ([#3976](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3976)) [#3966](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3966)
* `[e6c9b3a](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/e6c9b3ad5def1b6ea682c6723106f8c77df94f92)` - Fixes issue with stale cache being used in CCtray which caused users associated with plugin-roles to not see pipelines which they were authorized to see otherwise. ([#3955](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3955)) [#3954](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3954)
* `[449cbc3](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/449cbc38c4839ddf0f81165f6b96b10cdd0e721e)` - Allows overriding default Go server ports when using windows service. ([#4038](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4038)) [#3982](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3982)

#### Security Fixes

* `[488712d](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/488712d7262dc6dd082aad3f2cf2d3ed05a3caa3)` - Token based approach for agent registration. ([#4014](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4014))

  + Adds a new endpoint to get token from server in exchange of agent uuid. The token for a given agent is issued for unknown agents only - already registered or pending agents cannot request for a token.
  + Agent requests for a token before registration if required. This token is stored on agent's disk and reused for registration calls.

  Note: As a result of this fix, [Go-lang agents](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-golang-agent) need to be updated to work with GoCD server versions 17.12 or higher, else the agent's registration would fail.
  Golang agent users can follow up with the author on [this](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-golang-agent/issues/50) issue.

#### API Changes

* Introduction of version 1 for [Config Repo API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#config-repo).
* Introduction of version 5 for [Pipeline config API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pipeline-config) ([#106](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/106))

  This version accommodates changes made to [pipeline locking behavior](https://docs.gocd.org/17.12.0/configuration/admin_lock_pipelines.html). In addition to this, the representation of the origin attribute has also changed.

#### Docker Images

* Addition of ability to run custom scripts while starting up the gocd-server or gocd-agent using the official GoCD docker images. [#46](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-server/issues/46)

#### Breaking Changes

* `[cdf6722](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/cdf6722bf17664799a81c42b5c2cc13ae48736fc)` - Remove code related to starting vncserver. ([#4028](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4028)) [#4005](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4005)

  Alternatives to using the VNC flag are mentioned in [this](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/4005#issuecomment-348138015) comment.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 17.11, version 1 of the users [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#users) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 18.1.0 release (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.5, authentication plugin endpoints have been deprecated. Support for these plugins will be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the [Authorization Plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) that were introduced. The following plugins are affected by this deprecation:
  + [Google OAuth Login](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-oauth-login)
    (Alternative: [Google OAuth Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/google-oauth-authorization-plugin))

    (Alternative: [GitHub OAuth Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/github-oauth-authorization-plugin))
  + [GitLab(CE) OAuth Login](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-oauth-login)
    (Alternative: [GitLab OAuth Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gitlab-oauth-authorization-plugin))
  + [TLS Client Certificates Login](https://github.com/cnorthwood/gocd-tls-auth)
    (Use [latest version](https://github.com/cnorthwood/gocd-tls-auth/releases) of TLS Client Certificates Login instead.)
  + [Strong Auth Plugin](https://github.com/danielsomerfield/go-strong-auth-plugin#go-strong-auth-plugin)
    (Use the bundled [gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin) instead.)
  + [Guest Login](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd_auth_plugin_guest_user)
* Plugins upload form has been removed from the new plugins page. It is still available in the old plugins page, which will be removed in release 18.2 (scheduled to be released in February 2018).
* As of release 17.9, version 2 of the plugin info [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 18.1.0 release (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

* `[6320d55](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/6320d55722cde007995579d4fe6ec786b6287ea6)` - Added support for gitlab webhook. ([#3862](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3862))
* `[2cb4c00](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/2cb4c003353e0b4b421af50680d6001cfa864a1a)` - GoCD Server session timeout has been made configurable. ([#3856](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3856)) ([docs](https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/dev_authentication.html))
* `[e51f3b6](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/e51f3b6427d2b44588d6a4c6a1d0a832b2b8ad82)` - GoCD Agent supports configuring proxies. ([#995](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/995))

#### Breaking Changes

* `[f501efc](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/f501efc5a00519461fdf7d93081f83fcca7df2b9)` - Move over to logback from log4j for logging. ([#3831](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3831))

  + Switching to logback solves a number of logging related issues such as [#3588](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3588), [#3557](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3557) and [#3403](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3403)
  + The users should now configure logging using corresponding `logback.xml` instead of `log4j.properties` for both server and agents ([docs](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/logging.html)).
  + This has been marked as a breaking change since GoCD would no longer honour `log4j.properties` file. Users managing `log4j.properties` file externally would have to update their scripts to use the `logback.xml` instead.
* Support for phusion based docker server and agent images have been removed this release. We provide support for the docker images for GoCD agents across the following operating systems - Alpine [3.5](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5/), CentOS [6](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-6/) & [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-7/) , Debian [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-7/) & [8](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-8/), Ubuntu [12.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/), [14.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-14.04/) & [16.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-16.04/)

#### Docker Images

* We have made a few changes to the GoCD Server ([Changelog](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#docker-gocd-server-17110)) and the GoCD Agent ([Changelog](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#docker-gocd-agent-17110)) Docker images.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 17.9, version 2 of the plugin info [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.12.0 release (scheduled to be released in November 2017). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.11, version 1 of the users [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#users) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 18.1.0 release (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.5, authentication plugin endpoints have been deprecated. Support for these plugins will be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the [Authorization Plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) that were introduced. The following plugins are affected by this deprecation:

### 17.9.0

Sep 11 13:00 UTC 2017: We are investigating an issue ([#3834](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3834)) with upgrades affecting a small number of users. Please hold off on upgrading to 17.9.0 until further notice.
#### Improvements

* `[928c585](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/928c5856c2bc73aa92c1a8eb1a86d8094a9fe806)` - Grouping elastic profile by plugin ID. ([#3772](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3772))

  We have created an organized view of the elastic agent profiles. Now, you can view them by the type of elastic agent plugin (Docker Swarm, OpenStack, ECS etc.), making it easier to find a particular profile.

  ![Group elastic profile by plugin id](../assets/images/releases/17.9.0/elastic-agent-grouping-by-plugin-id-3f70396b.png)

([#3401](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3401))

#### API Changes

* `[0587f21](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/0587f21042701d9ee1e64ae698341c495df6c8d8)` - Introduction of version 3 of Plugin Info [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) to include extension related information. ([#3719](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3719))

#### Bug Fixes

* `[4c9e3c9](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/4c9e3c9353f4d0e93fd3365dbc9fe4e891ac4a4e)` - Removed memory leaks from agent bootstrapper.

  GoCD agents are designed to automatically upgrade themselves when the GoCD server is upgraded. This requires the currently running agent to release all resources before exiting and handing over control to a newer version of the agent process. There were some file system resource and memory leaks that have been identified which affect versions of go-agent bootstrapper between 17.4 and 17.8. We recommend that users either upgrade their gocd server and agent versions to the latest version, or restart the agent process to release any memory and filesystem resources that may be locked by the agent process.
* `[e538ba0](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/e538ba0032fcdd6cc8c95d202267deeb6c46a979)` - Check if agent is disabled before job assignment.
* `[d47180f](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/d47180f2193239ddd318157c43d3f60b6168d9e0)` - Addition of a few more fields to materials form which is used in creation of pipelines.
* `[8f6cc6c](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8f6cc6c8c52fabecae024600d454e9a094d9fc2a)` - Send request headers from server to plugins.
* `[0eab696](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/0eab696075a5bbdf7cd117a1392101559705bab1)` - Stage and job related warnings should not be logged for a rerun stage/job. ([#3753](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3753))
* `[8f66499](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8f66499e169fdb3b8ff74b40da1f816bab7716dc)` - Fixes select all bug on admin edit in environment page. ([#3737](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3737))
* `[793d198](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/793d19809f2693028ab40ef83403810ef47a3b1f)` - Redirect authenticated user to home page on re-authentication.

#### Docker Images

* GoCD images make logs available to docker by writing them to STDOUT. Users can access the logs anytime by executing   `docker logs`   in both server and agent containers.
* We've launched an updated GoCD Agent docker image for the latest version of Alpine ([3.6](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.6/))

#### Breaking Changes

If you are using the commercial Amazon ECS Elastic Agent Plugin, upgrading to GoCD 17.9.0 would require a plugin upgrade to V2.0.0.

#### Deprecations

* As of release 17.9, version 2 of the plugin info [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.12.0 release (scheduled to be released in December 2017). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.5, authentication plugin endpoints have been deprecated. Support for this plugin will be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be released in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the [Authorization Plugins](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) that were introduced.

Existing configuration will be automatically migrated to use the new in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication plugins. No other actions necessary.
* As of 17.8, the phusion based docker server and agent images are deprecated in favour of the new docker [server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) and agent images. Support for the phusion images will be removed in 17.11.0 (scheduled to be released in November 2017). We provide support for the docker images for GoCD agents across the following operating systems - Alpine [3.5](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-alpine-3.5/), CentOS [6](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-6/) & [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-7/) , Debian [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-7/) & [8](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-8/), Ubuntu [12.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/), [14.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-14.04/) & [16.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-16.04/)

### 17.8.0

#### Pipeline as Code

With this release, GoCD supports [Pipeline as code](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html), out of the box. We've bundled the [JSON config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-json-config-plugin) and the [YAML config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin) with the GoCD server.
A shout out to our core contributor [Tomasz Sętkowski](https://github.com/tomzo) for maintaining these plugins.

#### Amazon ECS Elastic Agent Plugin

Thoughtworks now offers a new commercial plugin which allows you to run elastic agents on Amazon ECS. The plugin takes care of spinning up and shutting down EC2 instances based on the need of your deployment pipeline. For more information about this, [click here](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ecs-elastic-agent).

### 17.7.0

#### Security Fixes

**Important:** This release comes on the back of 17.6.0 as we have identified a critical security vulnerability with 17.5.0 and 17.6.0. If you are on 17.5.0 or 17.6.0, please upgrade immediately to this version to keep your GoCD server secure. We want to give sometime for users to upgrade before disclosing the details of the vulnerability.

### 17.6.0

#### Important

There has been a critical security vulnerability identified with this release, fixes for the same have been provided in 17.7.0. If you are on 17.6.0, please upgrade immediately to 17.7.0 to keep your GoCD sever and agent secure.

#### Security Fixes

This release has critical security fixes to prevent CSRF, XSS and Session hijacking exploits. We highly recommend users to upgrade to keep your GoCD server and agent secure.
Thanks [4cad](https://hackerone.com/4cad) for reporting these issues.

#### Improvements

* `[42c681d](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/42c681d1585db99747877830c2b1fdc2ca3e80b1)` - Added option to skip agent startup on windows. ([#3577](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3577))

  This adds a `/START_AGENT=NO` to prevent the agent service from starting up when performing a headless installation on windows. See the [documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/install/agent/windows.html) for more details.
* `[2c95a10](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/2c95a107fe31e1df6c7cd648be2fb0f6476c973f)` - Improve timestamp rendering on some pages. ([#3574](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3574))

  This improves the timestamp rendering on the job details, stage details and pipeline compare pages. You will now see timestamps in your local timezone.

  ![Improve timestamp rendering](../assets/images/releases/17.6.0/improve-timestamp-rendering-2-41be5dda.png)
* `[9450dba](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/9450dba3b22b82f9fc9154d0be875b222a3a722a)` - Add a "Rerun Failed" button to rerun failed jobs. ([#3570](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3570))

  ![Rerun failed jobs](../assets/images/releases/17.6.0/rerun-failed-jobs-182f21d2.png)
* The in-built password file authentication plugin now supports `bcrypt`, which is a stronger password hashing function. GoCD server administrators should migrate `SHA1` passwords to use `bcrypt` instead.

#### API Enhancements

* Introduced a [GitHub webhook API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#github-webhook) to accept push events on a GitHub repository or repositories in a GitHub organization.

#### Bug Fixes

* `[88f1678](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/88f1678f95a69d1e57ed2e8d6a6190da0de798af)` - Disable trigger with options button for view user in the environments page. ([#3602](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3602))
* `[dba8212](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/dba8212c29e188e85be76c2a731e02a28c0ab330)` - Javascript error when saving user preferences. ([#3576](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3576))
* `[30615dc](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/30615dcc7c5d40a4a4b7f4599d39fcfd8c99cb75)` - Reduce the amount of plugins that an agent downloads and initializes. ([#3584](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3584))

  This should reduce the amount of data an agent downloads when a plugin is installed, or the server is upgraded. This will also help reduce the amount of memory used by the GoCD agent process.

#### Breaking Changes

* `[8dfb1a9](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8dfb1a9a16d11ed814d16c47d55b8dc283d6044d)` - Removed Environments Config API v1. ([#3606](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3606))

  Version 1 of the [Environment Config API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#environment-config) was deprecated in 17.3. Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

#### Deprecations

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated. Please note the timeframe of when they will be removed.

* As of 17.5, support for in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication have been deprecated. Support for these authentication mechanisms would be removed in 17.9 release (scheduled to be released in September 2017). Existing configuration will be automatically migrated to use the new in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication plugins. No other action necessary.
* The [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) endpoints were introduced as an extension to the existing Authentication Plugin endpoints, with this Authentication Plugin endpoint were deprecated as of 17.5.0. Support for this plugin would be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be release in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the new Authorization Plugins.

### 17.5.0

#### Important

There has been a critical security vulnerability identified with this release, fixes for the same have been provided in 17.7.0. If you are on 17.5.0, please upgrade immediately to 17.7.0 to keep your GoCD sever and agent secure.

#### Authorization Plugin

[Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) extension was released as beta in GoCD 17.2.0, over the last couple of releases there has been more work done around fine tuning the endpoint. With this release we are taking the Authorization Plugin endpoint out of beta.

**Action required:** Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading GoCD. Refer to the Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization) for the latest changes.

The built-in LDAP and password file based authentication mechanisms have been deprecated and disabled in favor of separate plugins which implement the new Authorization Plugin extensions. The new plugins provide more functionality, with the benefit of allowing users to customize the behavior of these plugins. These plugins are bundled with the GoCD server, so no action will be required from users. Existing passwordFile and ldap configuration would be migrated to make use of these plugins.

* LDAP/AD authentication plugin

  The bundled [LDAP/AD authentication plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) will now allow users to connect to and authenticate with multiple LDAP/AD servers in their organizations. Early adopters of this plugin using the experimental build will have to make changes to their config. Refer to the plugin [changelog](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3601af8---bundled-with-gocd-v1750) to see the changes between experimental release to latest stable release.
* Password File Authentication Plugin

  The bundled [Password File Authentication Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin) currently supports only SHA1 hashed passwords, but support for other hashing functions is [on its way](https://github.com/gocd/filebased-authentication-plugin/issues/13).

There are 2 new sets of pages that allows configuring the authorization plugins and mapping of GoCD roles to users.

#### API Enhancements

* Introduced a [current user API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#current-user) that allows the logged in user to manage their profile.
* Introduced a [notification filters API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#notification-filters) that allows the logged in user to manage their email notification subscriptions.
* Introduced a [authorization configuration API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#authorization-configuration) that allows admins to configure Authorization plugins.
* Introduced a [roles API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#roles) that allows admins to manage user roles.

#### Bug Fixes

* `[9cec83f](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/9cec83fd6dda71ea085525354ca201ab7e4d3dec)` - Stop very large file systems (EFS) from being identified as having no space. ([#3426](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3426))

  Large filesystems like EFS, have an amount of storage that exceeds what can be addressed with a java `long` type (`263-1`). Any storage space greater than `263-1`, will be shown to be `263-1`.
* `[2b06534](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/2b06534c76eb40ee63dc0842af6d0bab22da5424)` - Pipeline not getting unlocked upon a successful run. ([#3497](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3497))

There has been more work done around fine tuning the Authorization Plugin endpoints, as part of this some of the plugin API calls have changed. Action required: Early adopters of this extension will have to update their plugins to handle the updated API calls before upgrading Go. Refer Authorization Plugin Endpoint [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization) for the latest changes.

#### Other Improvements

* `[262c107](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/262c107a8e8358214a6cf57c9395c315aa12fc12)` - Pipeline Quick Edit, disable edit until save completes. ([#3266](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3266))

#### Bug Fixes

* `[8224568](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8224568b0df3500525f16f4ff2bd81541f67d663)` - This fixes 17.2.0 upgrade failures in cases where cruise\_config xml had encrypted values with spaces. ([#3244](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3244))
* `[4db0550](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/4db05504d05ab5f88e7891a3cd7b4eac2f3ebcd5)` - Agents page retain sort order across page refresh. ([#3226](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3226))

#### Breaking Changes

* On GoCD servers installed on windows or if using the zip installers, logs will now be written to logs directory instead of the working directory. This would be a breaking change only if there are custom scripts relying on the logs location.
* The [gocd/gocd-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image now uses alpine as the base image.
* The [gocd/gocd-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image no longer recognizes the `latest` tag. Please use `docker pull gocd/gocd-server:v17.3.0` instead.
* The `gocd/gocd-agent` docker image no longer exists. We have a variety of agent images for different distributions.

#### Deprecations

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated, along with the timeframe when they will be removed.

* As of release 17.1, version 2 of the [Templates API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#template-config) was deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.4 release (scheduled to be released in April 2017). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.3, version 1 of the [Environment Config API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#environment-config) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.6 release (scheduled to be released in June 2017). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.

#### Docker Images and AMIs

* The [GoCD server](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-server/) docker image is now alpine based with support for volume mounts, with this going forward there will be no more support for phusion based images.
* You can download the docker images for GoCD agents across the following operating systems - CentOS [6](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-6/) & [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-centos-7/) , Debian [7](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-7/) & [8](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-debian-8/), Ubuntu [12.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-12.04/), [14.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-14.04/) & [16.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/gocd/gocd-agent-ubuntu-16.04/)
* We have also introduced an Amazon Linux based AMI for the GoCD Server making it very simple to launch GoCD server on your AWS EC2 instance.

Feedback is appreciated. Please log your feedback or issues on github for the following -

* GoCD Server - <https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-server>
* GoCD Agent - <https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent>
* GoCD AMI - <https://github.com/gocd/gocd-cloud>

### 17.2.0

#### Authorization Plugin Endpoint (beta)

GoCD currently supports password-file, LDAP and plugin based authentication.

In addition to authentication, GoCD offers authorization by restricting certain operations to specific users and groups of users ("roles").

Without the use of authorization plugins, roles can only be managed through GoCD and it does not provide an ability to use roles defined in systems used for authentication (for example in LDAP groups). With this limitation, administrators need to configure roles in multiples places.

The introduction of the authorization plugin endpoint (Beta) allows GoCD to delegate both authentication and authorization of users to plugins. The plugins will have the flexibility to use any identity service providers like LDAP, Google, GitHub etc.

Authorization Plugin Endpoint (beta) [documentation](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization) is available. We have built [LDAP Authentication plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) using the Authorization Plugin Endpoint, this plugin supports only authentication. We would recommend developers to write plugins which support both authentication and authorization and provide us feedback to enhance this endpoint.

#### Feature Enhancements

* `[c088435](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/c08843512b494ef1c483ebb699c615170dd13cf0)` - Template Authorization UI and API enhancements.

  + All pipeline group admins by default provided view permission to templates. Super admin can restrict this access.
  + Super admin can provide template view access to users/roles.
  + Allow template admins to delete templates via UI and API

### 17.1.0

#### Performance Improvement

* `[2ae7fdb](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/2ae7fdb72e31b2868cee8a3d757402e2e0e40456)` - Full config save optimization. ([#2912](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2912))

#### Breaking changes

* `[920b7ee](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/920b7ee2bd7fb5a614f9e7540e59bf38c60ee92b)` - Removed support for Java 7.

  Starting with the 17.1 release of GoCD, Server and Agents will only run with Java 8. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release of GoCD with Java 8.

  Windows installations of GoCD need not install Java 8 separately since the Windows installer comes bundled with a JRE. However this *may* require users to upgrade the agent installer on Windows.

  If you have trouble while upgrading to Go version 17.1, please take a look at the
  [troubleshooting page](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/troubleshoot_installer.html) in the
  documentation.
* `[7a48c1a](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7a48c1af2d0d2300654ea45d2dec7cf1299738ba)` - Removed GoCD OpenSocial Gadget (Card activity tab) and Pipeline Dashboard Widget in Mingle. ([#1908](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/1908))

  As of release 16.12, the [OpenSocial gadgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSocial) was deprecated. This feature is now removed because of a couple of reasons —
  (a) there's not enough evidence of many users using this feature in a way that'll impact their usage of GoCD
  (b) the underlying implementation framework ([Apache Shindig](https://shindig.apache.org/)) hasn't been maintained for quite some time and contained several security vulnerabilities.
* `[7274d23](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7274d233c1895d3364ce73575dc32cb7f60bbf55)` - Removed Version 2 and 3 of the Agents API. ([#2984](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2984))

  As of release 16.12, version 2 and version 3 of the [Agents API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#agents) was deprecated. Version 2 of Agents API was introduced in 15.3.0 and version 3 of the API was introduced in 16.8. These versions of the API have been removed in favor of version 4 of this API. This API is backward compatible, and users are encouraged to use it.
* `[1e48c42](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/1e48c421c8e416941a57815689e8555ad7ba5def)` - Removed Templates API Version 1.

  As of release 16.11, version 1 of the [Templates API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#template-config) was deprecated. Users are encouraged to use Version 3 of the API which is backward compatible with Version 1.
* `[f2ac6b1](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/f2ac6b182c03413e8c6cdbae26c47fe944a11897)` - Removed support for text based API support log. ([#2975](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2975))
* `[da61c2b](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/da61c2bd7ee7e95dcf35d67867d5336efee76c83)` - Removed old Agents page. ([#3015](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/3015))

#### Deprecations

The following features have been deprecated, along with the timeframe when they will be removed.

* As of release 16.12, git versions older than 1.9 are deprecated. Support for git versions older than 1.9 will be stopped in 17.2 (scheduled to be released in February 2017). Users are recommended to upgrade git on the GoCD server and agents (if git is used as a material). We are aware that the linux distributions have an older version of git installed by default. Please refer to [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/571549/git-1-7-9-5-upgrade-to-current-release-of-git-2-x-on-ubuntu-12-04/571633#571633) to upgrade git.
* As of release 16.12, version 1 of the [Plugin Info API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#get-all-plugin-info) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.2 release (scheduled to be released in Feb 2017). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 17.1, version 2 of the [Templates API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#template-config) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.4 release (scheduled to be released in April 2017). Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.12, version 2 of the [Pipeline Config API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pipeline-config) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.2 release (scheduled to be released in Feb 2017). Version 3 of this API is backward compatible, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.7, Java API based Go Plugins have been deprecated. Support for running these plugins will be removed in 17.2 (scheduled to be released in February 2017). Plugin developers are encouraged to upgrade their plugins to use [JSON message based plugin API.](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/tasks) to build plugins.

  Below is the list of plugins that will stop working in 17.2.

  **Note:** The GoCD team has built a [shim](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-package-material-plugin-shim) that allows migration of all plugins with minimal change. We are actively working with plugin authors to ensure that these plugins are migrated over in time for 17.2.

### 16.12.0

#### UI Refresh

The entire application has been refreshed to sport a flat look.

If you have feedback or issues with the new look please log them at [GitHub](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues).

![New Theme](../assets/images/releases/16.12/new-theme-912e9418.png)
#### Agents Page

A brand new snappy and light-weight replacement for viewing and managing agents!

The old page is still available as a toggle.
If you have feedback or issues with the new agents page please log them at [GitHub](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues).

![Agents Page](../assets/images/releases/16.12/agents-page-b520368d.png)
#### Elastic Agents

Elastic agents is now a fully supported feature in GoCD.

To be able to use elastic agents, you should install an existing [elastic-agent plugin](https://www.gocd.org/plugins), or [write your own](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/elastic-agents). Once the plugin is installed you must configure an "elastic agent profile" that you can associate with the jobs that require elastic agents.

![Create Elastic Profile](../assets/images/releases/16.12/elastic-profiles-add-new-eb4f88a3.png)
#### TFS Upgrade

We have upgraded to [TEE](https://github.com/Microsoft/team-explorer-everywhere) SDK 14.0.3. Users will now be able to use GoCD with TFS 2012, 2013, 2015 and [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/). Please file an issue if you're having issues connecting to TFS repositories. Earlier versions of TFS are no longer supported and may not work.

#### Pipeline Edit Link

Users can now directly navigate to the pipeline settings page from the stage and job detail page.

#### API Enhancements

* `[8952af2](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/8952af2168feca77c1e2115d0300ae1e521fa5ff)` - [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#packages) to manage packages.
* `[e599a23](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/e599a230697f26ad51596d50c7d38ec851aa00c6)` - [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#package-repositories) to manage package repositories.
* `[9aabf48](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/9aabf482c593a3b54ceac05aac8b6a3ba1d4889c)` - Introduced version 2 of Plugin Info [API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#plugin-info) to provide complete metadata for plugin type `package-repository` and icons for plugins that provide it.

#### Other Improvements

* `[fddc9fe](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/fddc9fe2187a87720c0bb2a222af95d7029312c2)` - Improve performance of downloading of agent jars on a server upgrade. ([#2813](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2813))
* `[5387e21](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/5387e2171ff4bd9aff68d3649f1e3ad5b13b44d5)` - Handling cleanup of agent and launcher jars from previous version of agent during an upgrade. ([#2789](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2789))
* `[b97b635](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/b97b6359ea4cbbab6a6a396c5d6a62a8fe3cc5b4)` - Generate additional windows installers to be able to package 32 bit and 64 bit JRE.

  There are two flavors of Server and Agent installers for Windows, one packaged with 64 bit JRE and the other with 32 bit JRE. 32-bit JREs only allow up-to 2GB of memory. Because large GoCD servers usually need more than 2GB of heap size, we recommend using a Server with 64 bit JRE. Agents should continue to use 32 bit JRE unless required.
* `[b763d31](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/b763d3144b8e3139facc1dbad1226c258e2a32f7)` - Generate SHA-256 webserver certs instead of SHA-1. ([#2842](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2842))

  The self-signed web-server certificate that GoCD generates is now a SHA-256 certificate instead of a SHA-1 certificate. SHA1 certificates have been [deprecated](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2014/09/09/sha1-deprecation-what-you-need-to-know) by most browser vendors and users will start to see a warning in their browsers.

  Any new installations of GoCD will generate a SHA-256 certificate. For existing installations, users should remove the file `config/keystore` to allow GoCD to regenerate a new server certificate. Depending on your [end-to-end transport security](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/ssl_tls/end_to_end_transport_security.html) settings you may need to configure the `-rootCertFile` argument to the GoCD agent.

#### Bug Fixes

* `[b34da2d](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/b34da2d28d6d0ba4e5d36a0a2d314e67b25d41a7)` - Bug fixes to ensure that `git gc` on the config repository works as expected.
* `[a34c6dc](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/a34c6dcc4dd3c5869b72e976af70779536511b07)` - Allow dots in the repository and package id. ([#2844](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2844))
* Miscellaneous fixes to the new quick edit and agents pages.

#### Library upgrades

* `[4aa1c56](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/4aa1c562e6c055bf18a32df87e4d54be3f267c21)` - Bump JRuby to 1.7.26 from 1.7.11.
* `[f4bce94](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/f4bce94a14e088caf7baf6dd9979cf69e0681146)` - Upgrading JGit to 4.5.0.201609210915-r.

#### Breaking changes

* `[5052154](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/5052154a4fed53d884d40b0114b9efc06b20434f)` - Removed Pipeline Config API V1. This API was deprecated since 16.7 and has been replaced with version 3. Version 3 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions older than 11 are no longer supported. Please use IE 11 or higher. [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download) is recommended.

#### Deprecations

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated, along with the timeframe when they will be removed.

* We shall be stopping support for git versions older than 1.9 in three months time (Feb 2017). Users are recommended to upgrade git on the GoCD server and agents (if git is used as a material). We are aware that the linux distributions have an older version of git installed by default. Please refer to [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/571549/git-1-7-9-5-upgrade-to-current-release-of-git-2-x-on-ubuntu-12-04/571633#571633) to upgrade git.
* The GoCD api support page `http://your-server:8153/go/api/support` supports JSON and plain-text outputs. JSON has been the default since release 16.6. We will be removing the plain-text output in release 17.1 (scheduled to be released in Jan 2017). It is much simpler to consume the JSON output than the plain-text output.
* As of release 16.12, the [OpenSocial gadgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSocial) have been deprecated. This feature will be removed in 17.1 (scheduled to be released in Jan 2017). This has been done for a few of reasons —
  (a) there's not enough evidence of many users using this feature in a way that'll impact their usage of GoCD
  (b) the underlying implementation framework ([Apache Shindig](https://shindig.apache.org/)) hasn't been maintained for quite some time and contain several security vulnerabilities.
* As of release 16.12, version 1 of the [Plugin Info API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#get-all-plugin-info) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.2 release (scheduled to be released in Feb 2017). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.11, version 1 of the [Templates API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#template-config) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.1 release (scheduled to be released in Jan 2017). Version 2 of the API is available, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.12, version 2 and version 3 of the [Agents API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#agents) is deprecated. Version 2 of Agents API was introduced in 15.3.0 and version 3 of the API was introduced in 16.8. These versions of the API will be removed in 17.1 release (scheduled to be released in Jan 2017). Version 4 of this API is backward compatible, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.5, Java 7 support was deprecated. Java 7 support will be removed in 17.1 release (scheduled to be released in January 2017). GoCD works great with Java 8, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.12, version 2 of the [Pipeline Config API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#pipeline-config) is deprecated. This version of the API will be removed in 17.2 release (scheduled to be released in Feb 2017). Version 3 of this API is backward compatible, and users are encouraged to use it.
* As of release 16.7, Java API based Go Plugins have been deprecated. Support for running these plugins will be removed in 17.1 (scheduled to be released in January 2017). Plugin developers are encouraged to upgrade their plugins to use [JSON message based plugin API.](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/tasks) to build plugins.

  Below is the list of plugins that will stop working in 17.1.

  **Note:** The GoCD team has built a [shim](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/gocd-package-material-plugin-shim) that allows migration of all plugins with minimal change. We are actively working with plugin authors to ensure that these plugins are migrated over in time for 17.1.

### 16.9.0

#### Quick Edit (Beta)

Currently, editing a pipeline means navigating through multiple pages (and page refreshes), for modifying stages, jobs with tabs for options and environment variables, etc. Quick edit to make it smoother.

With this feature, you can change a pipeline's materials/stages/jobs/tasks simultaneously and update it as single operation. This feature also uses the new pipeline config API to make your configuration changes quicker.

**How do I use this?**

Click on "Quick Edit" button on the pipeline edit page.

![Quick edit](../assets/images/releases/16.9/quickeditbutton-78e54c92.png "Quick edit")

Click on "Normal Edit" button to get back to old edit page.

![Quick edit](../assets/images/releases/16.9/quickeditpage-126e6d7a.png "Quick edit")

**Why is this beta?**

We are working on adding few missing features like:

* Package materials (like yum, maven, artifactory plugins)
* Pipeline template editing, pipelines that use templates can only update Pipeline Settings
  and Materials

**Known issues?**

Missing API validation for a few attributes, they are tracked below:

* Pipeline Config API: Stage operate permission user not validated ([#2629](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2629))
* Pipeline Config API: Validation missing for parameter name used in the custom task argument ([#2628](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2628))
* Missing validation errors on pipeline\_config API ([#2553](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/2553))

**What's next?**

### 16.8.0

#### Beta Feature - Elastic agents

The new extension point allows the gocd server (with the help of plugins) to spin up and shut down agents on demand.
This extension point allows plugin developers to write plugins that allow GoCD to hook into and leverage various technologies
like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/),
[GCE](https://cloud.google.com/compute/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Developers can start building their own elastic agent plugins by forking the
[skeleton plugin](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/elastic-agent-skeleton-plugin)
and looking at a sample [docker plugin](https://github.com/gocd-contrib/docker-elastic-agents)
as an example reference implementation. The plugin API documentation can be found [here](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/elastic-agents).

  **These APIs will be removed in the September release of GoCD.**
* In light of downward trend in Solaris installers, we are now considering a timeline to stop providing Solaris installers for GoCD. Users can continue to use the generic zip files to run GoCD on Solaris. However the support for Solaris will be on a best-effort basis.

  **We will stop providing Solaris installers from the July release of GoCD.**

Greene, Ashwanth Kumar, Jakub Narloch, Alex Voitau, Joakim Wånggren, Paul Clarkin, X O and markuswehrle for making Go better.

### 15.2.0

#### Improvements to the console log

GoCD now supports rendering of ANSI color codes to show you much more beautiful console logs. Additionally, Go will automatically follow the logs as your build produces it, very much like your favorite terminal program.

![Console log coloring](../assets/images/releases/15.2/console-log-color-9cb3f569.png "Console log coloring")
##### Authentication end-point

With the newly exposed authentication end-point, Go users can now add custom authentication schemes through plugins. Read the [blog
post](https://www.gocd.org/2015/06/18/authentication-end-point.html) for details.

![GoCD Login Page with Git Hub icon](../assets/images/blog/authentication-plugins/login-page-b00e9881.png "GoCD Login Page with GitHub icon")
##### Setup hostname when auto-registering agents

You can now specify a property `agent.auto.register.hostname` to setup the hostname when
[auto-registering](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/agent_auto_register.html) an agent.

#### API Improvements

Go's APIs are fairly old, have inconsistent and unpredictable content types (csv, xml, json, plain text).

We have now migrated the
[Agents API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#agents),
[Users API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#users),
[Backups API](https://api.gocd.org/current/#backups) to use JSON hypermedia API (using JSON+HAL).

Going forward, we would like to announce an ongoing effort to improve and migrate existing APIs to use something that is more modern, easy to discover, learn and build API clients for.

Learn more about the new API on our new [api documentation](https://api.gocd.org/current) site.

#### Thanks!

[@ctorpe](https://github.com/ctorpe), [@thenathanjones](https://github.com/thenathanjones),
[@nfisher](https://github.com/nfisher), @paulclarkin, [@skarlso](https://github.com/Skarlso) for making Go better.

### 15.1.0

#### New plugin endpoint for "Materials"

This new plugin endpoint introduced in 15.1 allows Go's already long list of source code materials to be extended without making changes to the core!

Support for this endpoint brought along support for GitHub pull requests, contributed by an external contributor [@ashwanthkumar](https://github.com/ashwanthkumar) (so exciting!), with support from a Go core contributor, [@srinivasupadhya](https://github.com/srinivasupadhya/).
You'll never need to wish that Go supported your favorite kind of material repository, you can implement support for it yourself!

You can see all the SCM material plugins on the [Go Community plugins](https://www.gocd.org/plugins/). See how to write one, [here](https://docs.gocd.org/current/extension_points/scm_extension.html).

Here's how the GitHub pull requests plugin looks in action (below). Read more about it in this [blog post](https://www.gocd.org/2015/04/27/Feature-Branch-Support.html). Watch out for more improvements in the UI around this area.

![GitHub Pull Request with GitHub poller and notification plugins](../assets/images/releases/15.1/15_1_github_pr-4d2a6ba4.png "GitHub Pull Request with GitHub poller and notification plugins")
#### New plugin endpoint for "Notifications"

Continuing on the path of opening up different parts of Go for extension, Go 15.1 introduces a new plugin endpoint for notifications. At this point, Go notifies the plugin of changes in the status of every stage, as it happens! This allows
for quite a lot of use cases, and we are excited to see plugins written against this endpoint even before release (yay, open source!).

[@matt-richardson](https://github.com/matt-richardson) has written a really nice generic notification plugin, which sends build notifications to any websocket listener! [@ashwanthkumar](https://github.com/ashwanthkumar) has written a great plugin to notify Slack about build status changes. [@srinivasupadhya](https://github.com/srinivasupadhya/) has written a couple of nice notification plugins to update pull request statuses in GitHub and Atlassian
Stash.

You can see all of those plugins on the Go Community plugins page/plugins/index.html. See how to write one yourself, [here](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/notifications/).

#### Pipeline label shortening

This contribution by [@alexschwartz](https://github.com/alexschwartz) helps declutter the Go Dashboard, by allowing the pipeline label to be trimmed, per material. This feature is really useful when dealing with unwieldy 40 character
SHAs in pipelines with git/mercurial materials in them. This feature allows this:

![Old long pipeline labels](../assets/images/releases/15.1/15_1_old_pipeline_label-9b431eaf.png "Old pipeline labels - Long")

to be changed into this:

![New short pipeline labels](../assets/images/releases/15.1/15_1_new_pipeline_label-e4efa9b7.png "New pipeline labels - Short")

Read more about this feature [in the documentation.](https://docs.gocd.org/current/configuration/pipeline_labeling.html#using-truncated-material-revisions)

#### Timestamps in console logs

Starting from Go 15.1, Go's console logs will have timestamps for every line. This is very useful for finding out long-running parts of tasks. Here's how it looks:

![Console log timestamps](../assets/images/releases/15.1/15_1_console_log_timestamp-d475e063.png "Console log timestamps")
##### More ...

* [#104](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/104) - Agents do not restart because of a server restart, any more (plugin sync issue fixed).
* [#725](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/725) - Pipeline instance information through APIs.
* [#941](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/941) - Small improvement around config save -Look for a lot more around this area soon!

# GoCD before 22.1.0 bundled ldap-authentication-plugin fails to neutralise LDAP special elements in usernames

High

[chadlwilson](/chadlwilson)
published
GHSA-x5v3-x9qj-mh3h
Apr 9, 2022

## Package

gocd-server

## Affected versions

>= 17.5.0, < 22.1.0

## Patched versions

22.1.0

## Description

### Impact

The bundled [gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin) included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries.

While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms.

This only affects users who have a working LDAP [authorization configuration](https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication) enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration.

### Patches

Fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin [v2.2.0-144](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.0-144).

### Workarounds

* removing any [authorization configurations](https://docs.gocd.org/22.1.0/configuration/dev_authentication.html#ldapad-authentication) for the bundled LDAP Authentication plugin
* if running outside Docker/Helm, users on GoCD `20.9.0`+ can manually upgrade the bundled plugin to [v2.2.0-144](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin/releases/tag/v2.2.0-144)
* users on GoCD `20.9.0`+ not able to upgrade to `22.1.0` can consider migrating their LDAP authorization configuration to the [patched v4.2.0-73+ version](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authorization-plugin/releases/tag/v4.2.0-73) of the [LDAP Authorization Plugin](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authorization-plugin), which supports both authentication and (optional) authorization to map to GoCD roles. This plugin was also subject to the same vulnerability in versions <=`4.1.0`, however since it is non-bundled, it is more easily user-upgraded.

**Authentication**

#

# Authentication

A newly installed GoCD server does not require users to authenticate. This is great for a trial. However, it is one of the first things you should change, as soon as you decide to use GoCD more widely.

GoCD has two methods of authentication built into it: Password-file based authentication and LDAP/Active Directory authentication. You can also choose from a collection of [community-maintained plugins](https://www.gocd.org/plugins/#authorization) for other methods of authentication, such as using Google or GitHub OAuth.

You can even write your own plugins for authentication (as in username/password combination) or authorization (as in deciding which GoCD roles a user should be allowed into) by using the [authorization plugin endpoint](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/).

“Authorization configuration” is the term used in GoCD for the configuration which allows a GoCD administrator to configure the kind of authentication and authorization used by it. GoCD can be setup to use multiple authorization configurations at the same time.

Note: The order of the configurations matters. They will be tried from the first one to the last one and each authorization configuration will be given a chance to authenticate a user, when a user tries to log in. If the user is successfully allowed by one of the configurations, then the following configurations will not be used.

Consider the example image below:

![Shows two authorization configurations](../images/user_authentication_multiple_configurations.png)

In this example, the password file authentication method will be tried first. If that succeeds, the user will be allowed to log in. If not, the LDAP authentication method will be tried next. If that succeeds, the user will be allowed to log in. If not, the user will be disallowed from logging in.

## Built-in methods of authentication

### Password-file authentication

1. Create an authorization configuration, by going to the “Admin” menu and then into “Security” and then “Authorization Configuration”.
2. Click on “Add” and provide any identifier (ID) for the configuration and then choose “Password File Authentication Plugin for GoCD”.
3. Provide the path to a password file on the GoCD server. Either absolute paths or paths relative to GoCD’s installation directory are accepted.
4. Specify allow only known users to login field. [Learn more](dev_authentication.html#controlling-user-access)

The [password file plugin’s documentation](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin#readme) has information about the values that can go into a password file.

![User authentication using password file](../images/user_authentication_password_file.png)

### LDAP/AD authentication

1. Create an authorization configuration, by going to the “Admin” menu and then into “Security” and then “Authorization Configuration”.
2. Click on “Add” and provide any identifier (ID) for the configuration and then choose “LDAP Authentication Plugin for GoCD”.
3. Provide the appropriate values for your LDAP server. You might need to talk to the LDAP/AD server administrator at your organization to get the right values.
4. Specify allow only known users to login field. [Learn more](dev_authentication.html#controlling-user-access)

The [LDAP authentication plugin’s documentation](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin#readme) has more information about the configuration.

![User authentication using LDAP](../images/user_authentication_ldap.png)

It you’ve installed any other plugins, they will also be available at the “Authorization Configuration” page, ready to be setup.

## Configurable properties

You can use one or more of the below to tweak settings such as the session configuration:

| System property name | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `go.server.session.timeout.seconds` | `1209600` (14 days) | Idle session timeout (in seconds). Do not set this to `-1` else the session will never timeout. |
| `go.sessioncookie.maxage.seconds` | `1209600` (14 days) | Expiry of a session cookie. Set to `-1` to expire the cookie on browser close. Do not set to `0` as this will cause the cookie to expire immediately. |
| `go.sessioncookie.secure` | `N` | Set this to `Y` to allow a session cookie to be set only if the request was made over HTTPS. Do not set this property if the users access GoCD via HTTP url |
| `go.security.reauthentication.interval` | `1800000` (30 mins in milliseconds) | GoCD forces a perodic re-authentication of users, this is to ensure any changes like removing of users or roles in the external authorization server are reflected in GoCD. The re-authentication interval (specified in milliseconds) is controlled by this property. |

See [the “Other config options” page](../advanced_usage/other_config_options.html) for instructions around setting these system property values.

## Controlling User Access

GoCD checks if an authenticated user is an existing user or a new user (logging in for the first time). For new users, there are two behaviors GoCD can operate under:

* Automatically register the new user in GoCD and continue with the login process.
* Deny access to the user if not already a registered GoCD user. New users will have to be [explicitly added](./managing_users.html#adding-users) by an admin.

To switch the mode in which the GoCD Server operates:

1. Login to GoCD as an admin
2. Navigate to the “Authorization Configuration” section
3. Set the “Allow only known users to login” for desired authorization configuration.
