Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-28247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied data within the application's web interface. Specifically, the application fails to properly neutralize or encode user-controlled input when rendering it in the HTML context, leading to reflected cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The application does not sanitize user input before embedding it into web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
* **Credentials Stealing:** Attackers can potentially steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
* **Integrity Compromising:** Malicious scripts can alter the appearance or behavior of the web page.
* **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages, tricking them into revealing sensitive information.
* **Other malicious activities:** Attackers could also carry out other malicious activities depending on the level of access the vulnerable application and the browser allows.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests. An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript in specific URL parameters. When a user clicks a manipulated link, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CA eHealth Performance Manager to exploit the vulnerability.
* **User interaction:** The victim user must click on a malicious link crafted by the attacker or visit a webpage where the link was introduced.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content identifies multiple vulnerable endpoints and parameters where this XSS is present.
- The document provides concrete examples of crafted URLs and the injected javascript.
- The issue is rated as medium severity because it requires user interaction.
