# Transferring unvested tokens after delegations

Low

## Package

gomod

github.com/evmos/evmos
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 17.0.1

## Patched versions

>=18

## Description

## Impact

This advisory has been created to address the following vulnerabilities found in the Evmos codebase and affecting vesting accounts.

### Wrong spendable balance computation

The spendable balance is not updated properly when delegating vested tokens. The following example help in describing the issue:

* Given a clawback vesting account with a starting `15M` vesting schedule. The initial spendable balance is `0`.
* Time passes and `5M` are vested. The spendable balance is now `5M`.
* The account delegate `5M`. The spendable balance should be `0`, but returns `5M`
* The account can send `5M` to another account.

The issue allowed a clawback vesting account to anticipate the release of unvested tokens.

### Missing precompile checks

Preliminary checks on actions computed by the clawback vesting accounts are performed in the ante handler. Evmos core, implements two different ante handlers: one for Cosmos transactions and one for Ethereum transactions. Checks performed on the two implementation are different.

The vulnerability discovered allowed a clawback account to bypass Cosmos ante handler checks by sending an Ethereum transaction targeting a precompile used to interact with a Cosmos SDK module.

### Missing create validator check

This vulnerability allowed a user to create a validator using vested tokens to deposit the self-bond.

## Patches

* The spendable balance function has been fixed correcting the `TrackDelegation` function.
* The checks for the staking module, for the delegation and the create validator, has been moved into the `MsgServer` of a wrapper around the Cosmos SDK staking module.

The issues have been patched in versions >=V18.0.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
