The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Draytek VigorConnect 1.6.0-B3, including CVE-2021-20123.

**CVE-2021-20123 Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** A local file inclusion vulnerability in the `DownloadFileServlet` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion. The `show_file_name` parameter in the `DownloadFileServlet` endpoint is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the underlying operating system with root privileges. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to the `DownloadFileServlet` endpoint.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.

**Proof of Concept:**
*   **Linux:** `https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/DownloadFileServlet?show_file_name=../../../../../../etc/passwd&type=uploadfile&path=anything`
*   **Windows:** `https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/DownloadFileServlet?show_file_name=../../../../../../windows/win.ini&type=uploadfile&path=anything`

**Additional Vulnerabilities Detailed in the Content (that are not part of CVE-2021-20123):**

*   **CVE-2021-20124:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion in the `WebServlet` endpoint. Similar to CVE-2021-20123, it allows for arbitrary file download but through a different endpoint and parameter.
    *   **Linux:**  `https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/WebServlet?act=getMapImg_acs2&filename=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    *   **Windows:** `https://<ip-of-VigorConnect>:4433/ACSServer/WebServlet?act=getMapImg_acs2&filename=../../../../../../../windows/win.ini`

*   **CVE-2021-20125:** Unauthenticated File Upload / Directory Traversal in the `DownloadFileServlet` endpoint. This allows an attacker to upload files to any location on the target system, leading to remote code execution.

*   **CVE-2021-20126:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **CVE-2021-20127:** Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion in the `Html5Servlet` endpoint. Allows authenticated users to delete files with root privileges.

*  **CVE-2021-20128:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Profile Name field of the floor plan page. Allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

* **CVE-2021-20129:** Information Disclosure vulnerability allowing unauthenticated access to system logs.

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to VigorConnect 1.6.1, which includes fixes for these vulnerabilities.
