Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate the `authorization_endpoint` URL before inserting it into a `<meta>` tag. This is specifically an issue with Safari browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. By inserting a malicious URL into the `authorization_endpoint`, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript that would execute when the page is loaded in Safari.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Impact:** The impact of the XSS is limited due to the Content Security Policy (CSP) applied to the vulnerable endpoint. This restricts the attacker's ability to perform actions that would otherwise be possible with XSS, such as accessing cookies or making requests to other domains.
*   **Potential for Data Exfiltration and Manipulation:** Although limited by the CSP, the attacker may still be able to perform some actions, potentially including stealing data or manipulating the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker would need to supply a crafted malicious URL for the `authorization_endpoint`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to set the malicious `authorization_endpoint`, implying they are likely an administrator or have similar control over the system.
*  **User Interaction Required**: The user must use the Safari web browser and visit the page containing the injected payload for the exploit to occur

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Safari browsers.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.2.1 of the `user_oidc` package.
*   The vulnerability is considered low severity.
*  The fix was implemented in pull request #496 in the nextcloud/user_oidc repository.
