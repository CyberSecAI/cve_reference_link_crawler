VisiLogic 9.9.00

This version provides new security features to protect networked controllers from
cybersecurity threats.

From this version of VisiLogic on, the Equipment Level cybersecurity measures described in the
Unitronics’ document hosted on our website, ‘Cyber Protection—Defending your Unitronics Samba™
and Vision™ series controllers’ are mandatory.

In addition, the Network Level protection measures described in that document, including using a
VPN to secure communications and protect equipment, are strongly recommended. Implementing
Network Level protection is the responsibility of the user.

This version of VisiLogic requires you to change default passwords and implement complex
passwords, and comprises new features to protect Vision and Samba controllers. These include
mandatory password protection for PCOM communications via Ethernet, a method enabling you to
block remote access actions initiated via PCOM, and to change the Information Mode default
password via Ladder.

PCOM is the Unitronics proprietary communication protocol that is used to communicate from a PC to
a Vision or Samba controller; as for example when downloading an application, or running online
mode via VisiLogic to controller. PCOM is also used by Unitronics’ PC-based or mobile utilities such as
Remote Operator.

Unitronics strongly recommends that users with existing applications comprising networked Vision
and Samba controllers update to the current VisiLogic version, as well as to updated versions of
Unitronics’ compatible utilities.

Please note that the OS version included with this version, VisiLogic 9.9.00, is 4.12.38. Installing
this OS into PLCs running an older OS will initialize retained memory (INIT command) as follows:

•  V1040/V1210

Installing OS 4.12.38 to a PLC with an OS older than 4.08.18 will initialize the PLC retained
memory

•  All other Vision & Samba models

Installing OS 4.12.38 to a PLC with OS older than 4.11.10 will initialize the PLC retained
memory

In addition, OS 4.12.38 does not support GSM and other modems; Unitronics UCR routers are the
secure, recommended devices for such applications.

New Features

The new features are listed below, and are explained in the Help topic PCOM via Ethernet.

Set PCOM
(Ethernet)
Password

To provide security to your controllers, you must use Set PCOM (Ethernet)
Password in your Ladder application to enable a password to prevent
unauthorized PCOM Ethernet access.

SDW 10:
Deny PCOM
Access
Bitmap

Then, when VisiLogic or other utilities attempt to establish PCOM communications
via Ethernet, the controller will request the password.

If the correct password is provided and verified, the controller will then allow
communications to be established.

Turn ON the bits of this bitmap to control access to networked Vision and Samba
Controllers.

Bit 0 – Block Run, Stop, Init, Reset, Download

Bit 1 – Block Change RS232/CANbus parameters

Bit 2 – Block Remote access for keypad

Bit 3 – Block Write to Data Tables and Download (Images and strings)

Bit 4 – Block writing to operands (MB, MI, etc.)

Bit 5 – Block SD operations

Set
Information
Mode
Password

You can use this Ladder element to set a password for Information Mode.

Once set, the controller will ask the user to enter the password and will verify it
before entering Information Mode

VisiLogic 9.8.94

This version supports Unitronics 4G UCR Routers, enabling:

•  Unitronics controllers to run SMS messaging via 4G networks.

Ladder:
2X the Space

VisiLogic Ladder nets are now wide, and reach completely across your PC screen
- no empty areas.

This gives you twice the editing space.

Switching I/O
Configurations

Once you have added I/O Expansion Modules to your project, you can create
variations called 'IO Module Configurations'.

Configurations are hardware profiles that enable a controller to run the
application if it has a physical I/O configuration that is different from the full I/O
Configuration in the project. Each profile that you create has an index number.

You determine which configuration is active by storing a value in SI 205. The
application will run according to the selected Config without error.

To enable your program logic to run correctly when switching configurations,
you must map the digital inputs and outputs to MBs, and use these MBs as
program conditions instead of Input and Output operands. Since analog I/Os are
linked to operands, they do not require any special handling.

Run As Admin

VisiLogic and other software utilities are now set to "Run as Admin".

Project
Navigation Tree

Simple, static HMI elements such as lines and circles now appear on the Project
Navigation Tree under Static.

Remote Access:

Alert
# Exploitation of Unitronics PLCs used in Water and Wastewater Systems

Release DateNovember 28, 2023

 Related topics:
[Cybersecurity Best Practices](/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices)

CISA is responding to [active exploitation](https://www.waterisac.org/portal/tlpclear-water-utility-control-system-cyber-incident-advisory-icsscada-incident-municipal) of Unitronics programmable logic controllers (PLCs) used in the [Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) Sector](https://www.cisa.gov/water). Cyber threat actors are targeting PLCs associated with WWS facilities, including an identified Unitronics PLC, at a U.S. water facility. In response, the affected municipality’s water authority immediately took the system offline and switched to manual operations—there is no known risk to the municipality’s drinking water or water supply.

WWS Sector facilities use PLCs to control and monitor various stages and processes of water and wastewater treatment, including turning on and off pumps at a pump station to fill tanks and reservoirs, flow pacing chemicals to meet regulations, gathering compliance data for monthly regulation reports, and announcing critical alarms to operations.

Attempts to compromise WWS integrity via unauthorized access threaten the ability of WWS facilities to provide clean, potable water to, and effectively manage the wastewater of, their communities.

The cyber threat actors likely accessed the affected device—a Unitronics Vision Series PLC with a Human Machine Interface (HMI)—by exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security and exposure to the internet. To secure WWS facilities against this threat, CISA urges organizations to:

* Change all default passwords on PLCs and HMIs and use a [strong password](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/require-strong-passwords). Ensure the Unitronics PLC default password “1111” is not in use.
* Require multifactor authentication for all remote access to the OT network, including from the IT network and external networks.
* Disconnect the PLC from the open internet. If remote access is necessary, control network access to the PLC.
  + Implement a Firewall/VPN in front of the PLC to control network access to the remote PLC. A VPN or gateway device can enable multifactor authentication for remote access even if the PLC does not support multifactor authentication. Unitronics also has a secure cellular based longhaul transport device that is secure to their cloud services.
  + Use an allowlist of IPs for access.
* Back up the logic and configurations on any Unitronics PLCs to enable fast recovery. Become familiar with the process for factory resetting and deploying configurations to a device in the event of being hit by ransomware.
* If possible, utilize a TCP port that is different than the default port TCP 20256. Cyber actors are actively targeting TCP 20256 after identifying it through network probing as a port associated to Unitronics PLC. Once identified, they leverage scripts specific to PCOM/TCP to query and validate the system, allowing for further probing and connection. If available, use PCOM/TCP filters to parse out the packets.
* **Updated Dec. 19, 2023:**
  + Update PLC/HMI to the [latest version provided by Unitronics](https://www.unitronicsplc.com/cyber_security_vision-samba/ "Unitronics PLC/HMI ").
  + See [Unitronics Cybersecurity Advisory 2023-001](https://downloads.unitronicsplc.com/Sites/plc/Technical_Library/Unitronics-Cybersecurity-Advisory-2023-001-CVE-2023-6448.pdf "Unitronics Cybersecurity Advisory 2023-001") for more information.
  + See joint Cybersecurity Advisory, [IRGC-Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploit PLCs in Multiple Sectors, Including U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems Facilities](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-335a "IRGC-Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploit PLCs in Multiple Sectors, Including U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems Facilities") (published Dec. 1, 2023) for additional technical information and mitigations.
  + See CISA's Secure by Design Alert: [How Manufacturers Can Protect Customers by Eliminating Default Passwords](/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-how-manufacturers-can-protect-customers-eliminating-default-passwords "How Manufacturers Can Protect Customers by Eliminating Default Passwords").

CISA and WWS Sector partners have developed numerous tools and resources that water utilities can use to increase their cybersecurity. Please visit:

## Unitronics Cybersecurity for Vision and Samba PLC Series

In today’s interconnected world, cybersecurity is more important than ever, especially in industrial control systems (ICS). ICS environments are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which can have significant consequences, including production disruptions, safety hazards, and financial losses.

Unitronics has developed a comprehensive approach to protecting its controllers. This page outlines Unitronics’ main tools and recommendations intended to raise the level of cyber protection of automation projects and machines based on Unitronics Vision and Samba Series controllers.

**New! VisiLogic version 9.9.00 has built-in security enhancements.
 To download the latest version [Click Here.](https://www.unitronicsplc.com/software-visilogic-for-programmable-controllers/)**

## 1. Equipment level

**Basics:**

**1. Stay Updated** via http://www.unitronicsplc.com **–** Unitronics develops and improves its products throughout their life cycle. The company website contains the most up-to-date versions of both software and operating systems, which may include advances in Cyber protection.

**2. Access Permissions and Passwords:** Strictly control local and network access permissions to the controller and associated equipment.

**3. Remote access permissions-** Manage and define the remote access permissions according to system’s and user needs in order to minimize unnecessary exposure.
 For example, the PCOM protocol (a built-in communication protocol for development and management) allows protection at various levels:

* Blocked Access: Ensure that controllers do not allow connection to this protocol until there is a need for viewing only.
* Operator: Viewing and updating data.
* Technician: Troubleshooting, changing controller settings, and updating versions.

**4. Communication Design:**

* Design the communication to reduce the usage of “SERVER” mode configured sockets
* Configure unused sockets in “Client” mode

**5.  Multifactor Authentication:** Use SB 314 and SDW 10 to configure multifactor authentication to your Vision / Samba device.
 Follow the software help section for detailed instructions.

An example application can be found at:
 <https://downloads.unitronicsplc.com/Sites/plc/support-tools-and-applications/V570_PCOM_MFA.vlp>

## 2. Network level

**Secure Communication**

**1. Controller as Internet Client:** If the controller must communicate with components or servers on the Internet, ensure that the controller is the client initiating the communication.

**2. Connecting automation equipment to the Internet:**

* Ensure that all equipment is behind a Firewall and that there are no Firewall Rules exposing the LAN network to entry from the WAN network.
   (whether it is a cellular router or a wired network).
* Verify that there are no Port Forwarding settings exposing automation equipment directly to the public network.To quickly and easily implement network-level protection, it is recommended to use UCR products, Unitronics’ industrial router series that includes built-in Firewall and VPN functionality. For quick connection, refer to: [Defining VPN in UCR products in 4 steps.](https://bit.ly/3tnPgn0)

**3. Modbus Protection:** Limit the Modbus master accessible address space by enabling SB 305 and setting SI 165-168 values according to the required address space. Follow the VisiLogic help section for more details.

## 3. Complete Solution

**Secure Connection – UniCloud-based**

Unitronics’ [UniCloud](https://unitronics.cloud/) IIoT platform allows secure connection **without the need for fixed or public Internet IP addresses**—no prior knowledge in cyber or IT is needed for implementation.
 The platform contains multiple layers of advanced encryption and protection, that together provide a complete, secure solution that allows access to be restricted by permission level and tracking actual connections.
