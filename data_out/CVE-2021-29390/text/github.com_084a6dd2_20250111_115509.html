* #### [Reorganize source to make things easier to find](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/e69dd40c07e089b1d04aa96685b1ede8bef5809d "Reorganize source to make things easier to find - Move all libjpeg documentation, except for README.ijg, into the doc/ subdirectory. - Move the TurboJPEG C API documentation from doc/html/ into doc/turbojpeg/. - Move all C source code and headers into a src/ subdirectory. - Move turbojpeg-jni.c into the java/ subdirectory. Referring to #226, there is no ideal solution to this problem. A semantically ideal solution would have involved placing all source code, including the SIMD and Java source code, under src/ (or perhaps placing C library source code under lib/ and C test program source code under test/), all header files under include/, and all documentation under doc/. However: - To me it makes more sense to have separate top-level directories for each language, since the SIMD extensions and the Java API are technically optional features. src/ now contains only the code that is relevant to the core C API libraries and associated programs. - I didn't want to bury the java/ and simd/ directories or add a level of depth to them, since both directories already contain source code that is 3-4 levels deep. - I would prefer not to separate the header files from the C source code, because: 1. It would be disruptive. libjpeg and libjpeg-turbo have historically placed C source code and headers in the same directory, and people who are familiar with both projects (self included) are used to looking for the headers in the same directory as the C source code. 2. In terms of how the headers are used internally in libjpeg-turbo, the distinction between public and private headers is a bit fuzzy. - It didn't make sense to separate the test source code from the library source code, since there is not a clear distinction in some cases. (For instance, the IJG image I/O functions are used by cjpeg and djpeg as well as by the TurboJPEG API.) This solution is minimally disruptive, since it keeps all C source code and headers together and keeps java/ and simd/ as top-level directories. It is a bit awkward, because java/ and simd/ technically contain source code, even though they are not under src/. However, other solutions would have been more awkward for different reasons. Closes #226")

* #### [Fix block smoothing w/vert.-subsampled prog. JPEGs](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/9b704f96b2dccc54363ad7a2fe8e378fc1a2893b "Fix block smoothing w/vert.-subsampled prog. JPEGs The 5x5 interblock smoothing implementation, introduced in libjpeg-turbo 2.1, improperly extended the logic from the traditional 3x3 smoothing implementation. Both implementations point prev_block_row and next_block_row to the current block row when processing, respectively, the first and the last block row in the image: if (block_row > 0 || cinfo->output_iMCU_row > 0) prev_block_row = buffer[block_row - 1] + cinfo->master->first_MCU_col[ci]; else prev_block_row = buffer_ptr; if (block_row < block_rows - 1 || cinfo->output_iMCU_row < last_iMCU_row) next_block_row = buffer[block_row + 1] + cinfo->master->first_MCU_col[ci]; else next_block_row = buffer_ptr; 6d91e950c871103a11bac2f10c63bf998796c719 naively extended that logic to accommodate a 5x5 smoothing window: if (block_row > 1 || cinfo->output_iMCU_row > 1) prev_prev_block_row = buffer[block_row - 2] + cinfo->master->first_MCU_col[ci]; else prev_prev_block_row = prev_block_row; if (block_row < block_rows - 2 || cinfo->output_iMCU_row + 1 < last_iMCU_row) next_next_block_row = buffer[block_row + 2] + cinfo->master->first_MCU_col[ci]; else next_next_block_row = next_block_row; However, this new logic was only correct if block_rows == 1, so the values of prev_prev_block_row and next_next_block_row were incorrect when processing, respectively, the second and second to last iMCU rows in a vertically-subsampled progressive JPEG image. The intent was to: - point prev_block_row to the current block row when processing the first block row in the image, - point prev_prev_block_row to prev_block_row when processing the first two block rows in the image, - point next_block_row to the current block row when processing the last block row in the image, and - point next_next_block_row to next_block_row when processing the last two block rows in the image. This commit modifies decompress_smooth_data() so that it computes the current block row's position relative to the whole image and sets the block row pointers based on that value. This commit also restores a line of code that was accidentally deleted by 6d91e950c871103a11bac2f10c63bf998796c719: access_rows += compptr->v_samp_factor; /* prior iMCU row too */ access_rows is merely a sanity check that tells the access_virt_barray() method to generate an error if accessing the specified number of rows would cause a buffer overrun. Essentially, it is a belt-and-suspenders measure to ensure that j*init_d_coef_controller() allocated enough rows for the full-image virtual array. Thus, excluding that line of code did not cause an observable issue. This commit also documents dbae59281fdc6b3a6304a40134e8576d50d662c0 in the change log. Fixes #721")

* #### [Fix interblock smoothing with narrow prog. JPEGs](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/dbae59281fdc6b3a6304a40134e8576d50d662c0 "Fix interblock smoothing with narrow prog. JPEGs Due to an oversight, the assignment of DC05, DC10, DC15, DC20, and DC25 (the right edge coefficients in the 5x5 interblock smoothing window) in decompress_smooth_data() was incorrect for images exactly two MCU blocks wide. For such images, DC04, DC09, DC14, DC19, and DC24 were assigned values based on the last MCU column, but DC05, DC10, DC15, DC20, and DC25 were assigned values based on the first MCU column (because block_num + 1 was never less than last_block_column.) This commit modifies jdcoefct.c so that, for images at least two MCU blocks wide, DC05, DC10, DC15, DC20, and DC25 are assigned the same values as DC04, DC09, DC14, DC19, and DC24 (respectively.) DC05, DC10, DC15, DC20, and DC25 are then immediately overwritten for images more than two MCU blocks wide. Since this issue was minor and not likely obvious to an end user, the fix is undocumented. Fixes #700")

* #### [Clean up the lossless JPEG feature](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/217d1a75f549c407d5372997eee13d37123845a9 "Clean up the lossless JPEG feature - Rename jpeg_simple_lossless() to jpeg_enable_lossless() and modify the function so that it stores the lossless parameters directly in the Ss and Al fields of jpeg_compress_struct rather than using a scan script. - Move the cjpeg -lossless switch into \"Switches for advanced users\". - Document the libjpeg API and run-time features that are unavailable in lossless mode, and ensure that all parameters, functions, and switches related to unavailable features are ignored or generate errors in lossless mode. - Defer any action that depends on whether lossless mode is enabled until jpeg_start_compress()/jpeg_start_decompress() is called. - Document the purpose of the point transform value. - \"Codec\" stands for coder/decoder, so it is a bit awkward to say \"lossless compression codec\" and \"lossless decompression codec\". Use \"lossless compressor\" and \"lossless decompressor\" instead. - Restore backward API/ABI compatibility with libjpeg v6b: * Move the new 'lossless' field from the exposed jpeg_compress_struct and jpeg_decompress_struct structures into the opaque jpeg_comp_master and jpeg_decomp_master structures, and allocate the master structures in the body of jpeg_create_compress() and jpeg_create_decompress(). * Remove the new 'process' field from jpeg_compress_struct and jpeg_decompress_struct and replace it with the old 'progressive_mode' field and the new 'lossless' field. * Remove the new 'data_unit' field from jpeg_compress_struct and jpeg_decompress_struct and replace it with a locally-computed data unit variable. * Restore the names of macros and fields that refer to DCT blocks, and document that they have a different meaning in lossless mode. (Most of them aren't very meaningful in lossless mode anyhow.) * Remove the new alloc_darray() method from jpeg_memory_mgr and replace it with an internal macro that wraps the alloc_sarray() method. * Move the JDIFF* data types from jpeglib.h and jmorecfg.h into jpegint.h. * Remove the new 'codec' field from jpeg_compress_struct and jpeg_decompress_struct and instead reuse the existing internal coefficient control, forward/inverse DCT, and entropy encoding/decoding structures for lossless compression/decompression. * Repurpose existing error codes rather than introducing new ones. (The new JERR_BAD_RESTART and JWRN_MUST_DOWNSCALE codes remain, although JWRN_MUST_DOWNSCALE will probably be removed in libjpeg-turbo, since we have a different way of handling multiple data precisions.) - Automatically enable lossless mode when a scan script with parameters that are only valid for lossless mode is detected, and document the use of scan scripts to generate lossless JPEG images. - Move the sequential and shared Huffman routines back into jchuff.c and jdhuff.c, and document that those routines are shared with jclhuff.c and jdlhuff.c as well as with jcphuff.c and jdphuff.c. - Move MAX_DIFF_BITS from jchuff.h into jclhuff.c, the only place where it is used. - Move the predictor and scaler code into jclossls.c and jdlossls.c. - Streamline register usage in the [un]differencers (inspired by similar optimizations in the color [de]converters.) - Restructure the logic in a few places to reduce duplicated code. - Ensure that all lossless-specific code is guarded by C_LOSSLESS_SUPPORTED or D_LOSSLESS_SUPPORTED and that the library can be built successfully if either or both of those macros is undefined. - Remove all short forms of external names introduced by the lossless JPEG patch. (These will not be needed by libjpeg-turbo, so there is no use cleaning them up.) - Various wordsmithing, formatting, and punctuation tweaks - Eliminate various compiler warnings.")

* #### [Vastly improve 12-bit JPEG integration](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/e8b40f3c2ba187ba95c13c3e8ce21c8534256df7 "Vastly improve 12-bit JPEG integration The Gordian knot that 7fec5074f962b20ed00b4f5da4533e1e8d4ed8ac attempted to unravel was caused by the fact that there are several data-precision-dependent (JSAMPLE-dependent) fields and methods in the exposed libjpeg API structures, and if you change the exposed libjpeg API structures, then you have to change the whole API. If you change the whole API, then you have to provide a whole new library to support the new API, and that makes it difficult to support multiple data precisions in the same application. (It is not impossible, as example.c demonstrated, but using data-precision-dependent libjpeg API structures would have made the cjpeg, djpeg, and jpegtran source code hard to read, so it made more sense to build, install, and package 12-bit-specific versions of those applications.) Unfortunately, the result of that initial integration effort was an unreadable and unmaintainable mess, which is a problem for a library that is an ISO/ITU-T reference implementation. Also, as I dug into the problem of lossless JPEG support, I realized that 16-bit lossless JPEG images are a thing, and supporting yet another version of the libjpeg API just for those images is untenable. In fact, however, the touch points for JSAMPLE in the exposed libjpeg API structures are minimal: - The colormap and sample_range_limit fields in jpeg_decompress_struct - The alloc_sarray() and access_virt_sarray() methods in jpeg_memory_mgr - jpeg_write_scanlines() and jpeg_write_raw_data() - jpeg_read_scanlines() and jpeg_read_raw_data() - jpeg_skip_scanlines() and jpeg_crop_scanline() (This is subtle, but both of those functions use JSAMPLE-dependent opaque structures behind the scenes.) It is much more readable and maintainable to provide 12-bit-specific versions of those six top-level API functions and to document that the aforementioned methods and fields must be type-cast when using 12-bit samples. Since that eliminates the need to provide a 12-bit-specific version of the exposed libjpeg API structures, we can: - Compile only the precision-dependent libjpeg modules (the coefficient buffer controllers, the colorspace converters, the DCT/IDCT managers, the main buffer controllers, the preprocessing and postprocessing controller, the downsampler and upsamplers, the quantizers, the integer DCT methods, and the IDCT methods) for multiple data precisions. - Introduce 12-bit-specific methods into the various internal structures defined in jpegint.h. - Create precision-independent data type, macro, method, field, and function names that are prefixed by an underscore, and use an internal header to convert those into precision-dependent data type, macro, method, field, and function names, based on the value of BITS_IN_JSAMPLE, when compiling the precision-dependent libjpeg modules. - Expose precision-dependent jinit*() functions for each of the precision-dependent libjpeg modules. - Abstract the precision-dependent libjpeg modules by calling the appropriate precision-dependent jinit*() function, based on the value of cinfo->data_precision, from top-level libjpeg API functions.")

The crux of the issue wasn't the size of the whole_image virtual array but rather that, since last_iMCU_row is unsigned, (last_iMCU_row - 1) wrapped around to 0xFFFFFFFF when last_iMCU_row was 0. This caused the interblock smoothing algorithm introduced in 6d91e950c871103a11bac2f10c63bf998796c719 to erroneously try to access the next two iMCU rows, neither of which existed. The first attempt at a fix (4dbc293125b417f97e5b1ca9e7260c82ff199a06) exposed a NULL dereference, detected by OSS-Fuzz, that occurred when attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image to a YUV buffer using tjDecompressToYUV*() with 1/4 IDCT scaling.

Previously that was not always the case unless the progressive JPEG image being decompressed had at least five iMCU rows. Since an iMCU has a height of (8 * the vertical sampling factor), attempting to decompress 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 images <= 32 pixels in height or 4:2:0 images <= 64 pixels in height triggered a JERR_BAD_VIRTUAL_ACCESS error in decompress_smooth_data(), because access_rows exceeded the number of rows in the virtual array.

* #### [Improve code formatting consistency](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/19c791cdac6df84418c66eb9d67cfa9703bc2461 "Improve code formatting consistency With rare exceptions ... - Always separate line continuation characters by one space from preceding code. - Always use two-space indentation. Never use tabs. - Always use K&R-style conditional blocks. - Always surround operators with spaces, except in raw assembly code. - Always put a space after, but not before, a comma. - Never put a space between type casts and variables/function calls. - Never put a space between the function name and the argument list in function declarations and prototypes. - Always surround braces ('{' and '}') with spaces. - Always surround statements (if, for, else, catch, while, do, switch) with spaces. - Always attach pointer symbols ('*' and '**') to the variable or function name. - Always precede pointer symbols ('*' and '**') by a space in type casts. - Use the MIN() macro from jpegint.h within the libjpeg and TurboJPEG API libraries (using min() from tjutil.h is still necessary for TJBench.) - Where it makes sense (particularly in the TurboJPEG code), put a blank line after variable declaration blocks. - Always separate statements in one-liners by two spaces. The purpose of this was to ease maintenance on my part and also to make it easier for contributors to figure out how to format patch submissions. This was admittedly confusing (even to me sometimes) when we had 3 or 4 different style conventions in the same source tree. The new convention is more consistent with the formatting of other OSS code bases. This commit corrects deviations from the chosen formatting style in the libjpeg API code and reformats the TurboJPEG API code such that it conforms to the same standard. NOTES: - Although it is no longer necessary for the function name in function declarations to begin in Column 1 (this was historically necessary because of the ansi2knr utility, which allowed libjpeg to be built with non-ANSI compilers), we retain that formatting for the libjpeg code because it improves readability when using libjpeg's function attribute macros (GLOBAL(), etc.) - This reformatting project was accomplished with the help of AStyle and Uncrustify, although neither was completely up to the task, and thus a great deal of manual tweaking was required. Note to developers of code formatting utilities: the libjpeg-turbo code base is an excellent test bed, because AFAICT, it breaks every single one of the utilities that are currently available. - The legacy (MMX, SSE, 3DNow!) assembly code for i386 has been formatted to match the SSE2 code (refer to ff5685d5344273df321eb63a005eaae19d2496e3.) I hadn't intended to bother with this, but the Loongson MMI implementation demonstrated that there is still academic value to the MMX implementation, as an algorithmic model for other 64-bit vector implementations. Thus, it is desirable to improve its readability in the same manner as that of the SSE2 implementation.")

Some (particularly C++ programmers) prefer to tuck the pointer symbol against the type: type* variable; to emphasize that a pointer to a type is effectively a new type. However, this can also be confusing, since defining multiple variables on the same line would not work properly: type* variable1, variable2; /* Only variable1 is actually a pointer. */ This commit reformats the entirety of the libjpeg-turbo code base so that it uses the same code formatting convention for pointers that the TurboJPEG API code uses: type *variable1, *variable2; This seems to be the most common convention among C programmers, and it is the convention used by other codec libraries, such as libpng and libtiff.")

* #### [Replace INT32 with a new internal datatype (JLONG)](/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/1e32fe3113bd212d48fea93574c2a05282a67708 "Replace INT32 with a new internal datatype (JLONG) These days, INT32 is a commonly-defined datatype in system headers. We cannot eliminate the definition of that datatype from jmorecfg.h, since the INT32 typedef has technically been part of the libjpeg API since version 5 (1994.) However, using INT32 internally is risky, because the inclusion of a particular header (Xmd.h, for instance) could change the definition of INT32 from long to int on 64-bit platforms and thus change the internal behavior of libjpeg-turbo in unexpected ways (for instance, failing to correctly set __INT32_IS_ACTUALLY_LONG to match the INT32 typedef-- perhaps as a result of including the wrong version of jpeglib.h-- could cause libjpeg-turbo to produce incorrect results.) The library has always been built in environments in which INT32 is effectively long (on Windows, long is always 32-bit, so effectively it's the same as int), so it makes sense to turn INT32 into an explicitly long datatype. This ensures that libjpeg-turbo will always behave consistently, regardless of the headers included at compile time. Addresses a concern expressed in #26.")

They were annoying in the libjpeg code primarily because they were not consistently used and because they were used to format as well as indent the code. In the case of TurboJPEG, tabs are used just to indent the code, so even if the editor assumes a different tab width, the code will still be readable.) git-svn-id: svn+ssh://svn.code.sf.net/p/libjpeg-turbo/code/trunk@1278 632fc199-4ca6-4c93-a231-07263d6284db")
