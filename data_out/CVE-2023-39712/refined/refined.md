Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-39712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Free and Open Source inventory management system php source code" available on sourcecodester.com. Specifically, user-supplied input in the supplier section is not being validated before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that malicious script can be injected into a web page when an attacker causes a user to submit malicious input to the application that is then reflected back to them by the web server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can lead to various impacts:
    -   **Session hijacking:** The attacker could steal cookies, which could allow them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the application.
    -   **Malicious redirects:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.
    -   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page, leading to defacement.
    -   **Credential theft:** The attacker could use scripts to steal user credentials
    -   **Data manipulation:** Attackers could alter or steal data from the application.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the "Supplier" section of the inventory management system. 
- An attacker can inject the malicious payload through the "Name", "Address", or "Company" fields when adding a new supplier.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to access the application's "Supplier" section.
-   The attacker needs to be able to input data into the application's input fields.

**Steps to reproduce (from the provided gist):**

1.  Visit `http://localhost/ample/login.php`.
2.  Click on the "Register" button to navigate to the Registration page. (Note: This seems to be incorrect, the XSS vulnerability is in the Supplier page).
3. After clicking on "Register" we redirect to URL: `http://localhost/ample/index.php?page=dashboard`.
4.  Go to Supplier section `http://localhost/ample/index.php?page=suppliar` and add new.
5.  Use payload: `"><script>alert(123)</script>`.
6.  Click on add New Member.
7.  Click on Submit. Use the XSS payload (`"><script>alert(123)</script>`) and put it in the Name, Address, or Company sections.
8.  The value of 123 will be reflected, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
