- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Carousel Slider plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize the "Slides Per View" field allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with high privilege user access (like an administrator), can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin settings. When a page displaying the slider is viewed by other users, this injected script executes, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through the WordPress admin panel by adding or editing a slider and injecting a payload in the `Slides Per View` field. The malicious code is then stored in the database and executed when the slider is displayed on the front end.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least editor or administrator privileges within the WordPress site to access the Carousel Slider plugin settings and create a new slider or edit an existing one. They must be able to create or edit posts/pages to include the shortcode of the slider with malicious payload.
