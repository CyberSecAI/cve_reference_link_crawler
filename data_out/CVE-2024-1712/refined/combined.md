## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Carousel Slider < 2.2.7 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new slider at "Carousel Sliders > Add New"
2. Add photos to the slider
3. Add the payload `(1212"asd='' onmouseover='alert(1)')` to the "Slides Per View" field
4. Add the slider shortcode to a post/page and then view to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
