- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the DSA Service of the Intel Driver & Support Assistant. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to delete a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Symbolic link abuse vulnerability leading to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation by creating a symbolic link to be abused by the DSA Service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
