Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The AIT-Core software uses unencrypted communication channels (ZeroMQ) for exchanging telemetry and telecommand data over a network. This communication relies on the Python Pickle library for object serialization/deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unencrypted Communication:** Data transmitted between AIT-Core components (e.g., telemetry simulator and instrument) is not encrypted. This allows an attacker to intercept the raw TCP frames.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The use of Python's `pickle` library for deserialization of the transmitted data makes the system vulnerable to arbitrary code execution, if manipulated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can conduct a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, capture the network traffic, and inject malicious payloads into the data stream. When the receiving AIT-Core component deserializes this crafted data using `pickle`, it executes the malicious code, allowing for arbitrary code execution on either of the communicating hosts.
- This can lead to:
    - Command Injection
    - Lateral Movements
    - Privilege Escalation
- The attacker can gain complete control of the system where AIT-Core components are running, without requiring prior access to either of the hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between AIT-Core components.
- **Network Communication:** The vulnerability is exposed during data exchange over the network, specifically when transmitting telemetry and telecommand data via ZMQ.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned on the network where AIT-Core components communicate to perform the MitM attack.
- **Packet Capture:** The attacker needs to be able to capture raw TCP frames to understand the communication and be able to reconstruct a valid frame.
- **Payload Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious payload that will be executed when deserialized via the `pickle` library and inject it into the captured communication stream.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists due to the lack of encryption and the unsafe use of pickle library in the data exchange.
- The article mentions a demonstration using a reverse shell as the malicious payload, which resulted in remote command execution on the targeted host.
- The provided LinkedIn article also references other vulnerabilities discovered in the same software, including SQL injection and local code execution vulnerabilities.
-  The article further recommends avoiding the use of Pickle or sanitizing the loaded pickle files, as well as securing ZMQ communication with ZMQ SSH Tunneling.
