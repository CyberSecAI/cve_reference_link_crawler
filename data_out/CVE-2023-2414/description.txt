The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the vcita_save_settings_callback function in versions up to, and including, 4.4.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to modify the plugins settings, upload arbitrary files, and inject malicious JavaScript (before 4.3.2).
