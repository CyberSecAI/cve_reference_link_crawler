- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An incorrect bounds check in the geniezone driver leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local information disclosure. An attacker can read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation, no user interaction needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** System execution privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
