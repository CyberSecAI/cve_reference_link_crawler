    "text": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-32886. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from how the `DecodeRune` function handles incomplete byte sequences in multi-byte character encodings (UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS-2). When encountering an incomplete byte sequence, `DecodeRune` returns `utf8.RuneError` and a width of 0. This lack of progress in consuming input bytes leads to infinite loops in the calling functions, particularly in character conversion routines, causing excessive memory consumption.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Infinite Loop:** The core issue is that `DecodeRune` does not always return the number of bytes consumed, causing loops in functions like `convertSlow` to run indefinitely when handling incomplete multibyte sequences.\n*   **Incorrect Padding:**  The code does not properly pad input when using the `_utf16` introducer. This leads to incorrect results when converting from binary to utf-16.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is insufficient validation when converting to encodings that have a minimum byte length larger than 1. \n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted query like `select _utf16 0xFF`, an attacker can trigger an infinite loop and excessive memory consumption in the `vtgate` process, leading to a crash due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors. This effectively results in a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted query via the network that the Vitess instance processes.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the Vitess instance to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerability impacts `utf16`, `utf32`, and `ucs2` encodings.\n*   The fix requires ensuring `DecodeRune` always returns forward progress, even on invalid strings, and proper padding when using introducers.\n*   The vulnerability is present in Vitess versions before 19.0.4, 18.0.5 and 17.0.7 and was fixed in versions 19.0.4, 18.0.5, and 17.0.7\n*   The CVSS score is 4.9 with a network attack vector, low attack complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and high availability impact (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).",
