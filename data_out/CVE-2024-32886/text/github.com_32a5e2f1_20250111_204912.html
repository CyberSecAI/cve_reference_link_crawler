# Simple query results in infinite memory consumption and vtgate crash

GHSA-649x-hxfx-57j2
May 8, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/vitessio/vitess
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 19.0.4, < 18.0.5, < 17.0.7

## Patched versions

19.0.4, 18.0.5, 17.0.7

## Description

### Summary

When executing the following simple query, the `vtgate` will go into an endless loop that also keeps consuming memory and eventually will OOM.

### Details

When running the following query, the `evalengine` will try evaluate it and runs forever.

```
select _utf16 0xFF

```

The source of the bug lies in the collation logic that we have. The bug applies to all `utf16`, `utf32` and `ucs2` encodings. In general, the bug is there for any encoding where the minimal byte length for a single character is more than 1 byte.

The decoding functions for these collations all implement logic like the following to enforce the minimal character length:

[vitess/go/mysql/collations/charset/unicode/utf16.go](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8/go/mysql/collations/charset/unicode/utf16.go#L69-L71)

Lines 69 to 71
in
[8f6cfaa](/vitessio/vitess/commit/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8)

|  | if len(b) < 2 { |
| --- | --- |
|  | return utf8.RuneError, 0 |
|  | } |

The problem is that all the callers of `DecodeRune` expect progress by returning the number of bytes consumed. This means that if there's only 1 byte left in an input, it will here return still `0` and the caller(s) don't consume the character.

One example of such a caller is the following:

[vitess/go/mysql/collations/charset/convert.go](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8/go/mysql/collations/charset/convert.go#L73-L79)

Lines 73 to 79
in
[8f6cfaa](/vitessio/vitess/commit/8f6cfaaa643a08dc111395a75a2d250ee746cfa8)

|  | for len(src) > 0 { |
| --- | --- |
|  | cp, width := srcCharset.DecodeRune(src) |
|  | if cp == utf8.RuneError && width < 3 { |
|  | failed++ |
|  | cp = '?' |
|  | } |
|  | src = src[width:] |

The logic here moves forward the pointer in the input `[]byte` but if `DecodeRune` returns `0` in case of error, it will keep running forever. The OOM happens since it keeps adding the `?` as the invalid character to the destination buffer infinitely, growing forever until it runs out of memory.

The fix here would be to always return forward progress also on invalid strings.

There's also a separate bug here that even if progress is guaranteed, `select _utf16 0xFF` will return the wrong result currently. MySQL will pad here the input when the `_utf16` introducer is used with leading `0x00` bytes and then decode to UTF-16, resulting in the output of `ÿ` here.

### PoC

```
select _utf16 0xFF

```

Denial of service attack by triggering unbounded memory usage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
