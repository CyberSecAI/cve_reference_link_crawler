Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to create a specific chart type that allows the inclusion of custom JavaScript code. This code is then executed in an unprotected sandbox environment during subsequent requests to that chart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unprotected Sandbox:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sandboxing for the custom JavaScript code, allowing it to execute with potentially malicious intent.
- **Code Injection:** The ability to inject custom JavaScript code through a chart creation process is another core vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could result in a wide range of malicious activities, such as data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has high impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, suggesting that the attacker can be remote.
- **API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered via a request to the chart creation API (`/charts/api/charts/v1/`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges, such as a user who can create or modify charts can exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful once the malicious chart is created.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes CVSS v3 base metrics, confirming the severity is high: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The advisory suggests restricting access to the API for creating or modifying charts as a mitigation before the patched version can be deployed.
- The vulnerable package is `ghcr.io/datalens-tech/datalens-ui` versions < 0.1449.0.
- Patched version is >= 0.1449.0.
