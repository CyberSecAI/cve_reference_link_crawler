- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zephyr Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These injected scripts would be executed when users visit the affected page, potentially leading to the compromise of user accounts, data theft, or further malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user input fields within the plugin's functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the capability to provide input that the plugin does not properly sanitize. A user with a "Subscriber" role is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
