Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:2-M127) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.
