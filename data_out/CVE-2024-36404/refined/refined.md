{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `commons-jxpath` library, which allows the execution of arbitrary code through XPath expressions. Several methods in GeoTools pass user-supplied XPath expressions to this library without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through network requests where user input is used to construct XPath expressions.  Specifically, the following GeoTools methods are vulnerable:\n  - `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.getXPathValues(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`\n  - `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.countXPathNodes(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`\n  - `org.geotools.appschema.util.XmlXpathUtilites.getSingleXPathValue(NamespaceSupport, String, Document)`\n  - `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.FeaturePropertyAccessorFactory.FeaturePropertyAccessor.get(Object, String, Class<T>)`\n  - `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.FeaturePropertyAccessorFactory.FeaturePropertyAccessor.set(Object, String, Object, Class)`\n  - `org.geotools.data.complex.expression.MapPropertyAccessorFactory.new PropertyAccessor() {...}.get(Object, String, Class<T>)`\n  - `org.geotools.xsd.StreamingParser.StreamingParser(Configuration, InputStream, String)`",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They need to be able to send network requests that allow them to control the XPath expressions that are evaluated by the vulnerable GeoTools methods."
