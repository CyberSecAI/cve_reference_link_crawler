- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an incorrect privilege assignment in Dell PowerScale OneFS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect privilege assignment leading to potential privilege escalation and denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) and Elevation of Privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high privileged user with local access to the system.
