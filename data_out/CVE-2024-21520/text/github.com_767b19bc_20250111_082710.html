## Description

The header input is now properly escaped before splitting and joining with `<br>` tags. This prevents potential XSS attacks if the header contains unsanitized user input.

This pull request addresses a potential XSS vulnerability in the `break_long_headers` template filter. By escaping the header input before processing, the risk of XSS attacks is mitigated.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@browniebroke](https://github.com/browniebroke) Let's prioritise getting this sorted, rather than waiting on a test case.  I'd marginally prefer [#9438](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/pull/9438) over this, since the line break isn't actually required however we should just go with whatever gets this resolved as quickly as possible at this point. |

### **[ch4n3-yoon](/ch4n3-yoon)** commented [Jun 14, 2024](#issuecomment-2167704442)

| I've identified a potential XSS vulnerability related to the break\_long\_headers template filter used in the rest\_framework/base.html template file by APIView. This file employs the break\_long\_headers template filter, making the following code vulnerable to XSS attacks due to unsanitized user input:  ``` # views.py from rest_framework.views import APIView from rest_framework.response import Response  class Index(APIView):     def get(self, request):         username = request.GET.get('username', '')          response = Response('OK')         response['Location'] = f'https://x.com/{username}'         return response  # urls.py from django.urls import path urlpatterns = [ path('api/', Index.as_view()), ] ```  I believe it is essential to register this issue as a CVE to ensure that users of earlier versions of DRF are aware and can manage this vulnerability appropriately. Your thoughts on this? |
