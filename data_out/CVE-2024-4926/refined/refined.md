Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in the `manage_student.php` script of the School Intramurals - Student Attendance Management System. The `id` parameter, received through a GET request, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any prior validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which is due to the unsafe handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `manage_student.php` file is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. This may include student records, attendance data, and other confidential information stored in the database.
- **Potential for Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Though not explicitly mentioned, successful SQL injection attacks can also potentially allow the attacker to modify or delete data from the database, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a simple HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL to include SQL injection payloads.
   - Example URL: `/intrams_sams/manage_student.php?id=1*`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads, which requires basic knowledge of SQL.
- **No Authentication required**: The provided information indicates that the injection can be triggered directly via URL, which means that no prior authentication is necessary.

**Additional details:**
- The identified vulnerability is present in the **School Intramurals - Student Attendance Management System - 1.0**.
- The vulnerable file is located at `/intrams_sams/manage_student.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The exploit uses a simple SQL injection payload `1*`.
- The provided `sqlmap` command shows how an automated tool can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vector and attacker requirements to exploit CVE-2024-4926.
