The Booster for WooCommerce plugin is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution in versions up to, and including, 7.1.8. This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. The severity and exploitability depends on what other plugins are installed and what shortcode functionality they provide.
