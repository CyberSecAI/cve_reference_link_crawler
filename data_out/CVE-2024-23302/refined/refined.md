- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The private key used for Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) was inadvertently included in the `goxdcr.log` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Private key leakage
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of the private key could allow an attacker to potentially impersonate or intercept XDCR traffic, potentially compromising data or gaining unauthorized access to other clusters.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need access to the `goxdcr.log` file to extract the private key. This could involve unauthorized access to the server's file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the file system where the `goxdcr.log` file is stored.
