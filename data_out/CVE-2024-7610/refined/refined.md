- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A regular expression used for highlighting search results in code can cause catastrophic backtracking when processing very long lines with matches.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerability due to an inefficient regular expression pattern.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause high CPU usage on the GitLab server by sending a large number of search requests with very long lines containing matches, potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the search functionality of GitLab. An attacker needs to send a search query with `scope=blobs` that returns a result containing very long lines with matches.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to a GitLab instance and be able to send search requests. They do not need any specific privileges beyond this. They need to craft search queries that will return results with very long lines with matches.
