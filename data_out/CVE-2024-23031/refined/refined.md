{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application incorrectly handles URL encoding and decoding, specifically with the '-' character in JWT tokens. The application replaces '-' with '+' but fails to handle the character correctly in subsequent decoding, resulting in an opportunity for XSS injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper URL encoding/decoding",
      "Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input",
       "Vulnerable JWT handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. An administrator who is already logged in is vulnerable to cookie theft by accessing a malicious URL.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include a manipulated JWT in the 'info' parameter. The JWT's header contains parameters (`num`, `input`, `path`, `func`, `is_water`) that are vulnerable to injection. The attacker needs to create a specially crafted JWT, where the header parameters contain XSS payloads, and then URL-encode the JWT.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a JWT token, replace '-' with '+', and then URL encode this value to be placed in the 'info' parameter of the URL. They also need knowledge of the vulnerable parameters within the JWT header. The user must be logged in as an admin to be impacted."
