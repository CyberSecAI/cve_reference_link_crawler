  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application used `ng-bind-html` to display election descriptions before they were sanitized by the backend. This allowed for the execution of XSS payloads embedded within the election description.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input",
      "Use of `ng-bind-html` without proper sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious election description containing XSS payloads."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create or modify election descriptions to inject malicious content."
  },
  "fix_details": {
   "fixes_applied": [
      "Replaced `ng-bind-html` with `ng-bind` to display election descriptions as plain text.",
      "Used `$sanitize` service more pervasively on the election creation screen.",
       "Removed the usage of custom `htmlToText` filter, since it also needed sanitization."
