There was an issue with election description. During election creation, we relied in ng-bind-html to sanitize the visualization of election description before being sanitized by the backend (because it has not yet been sent to the backend), but apparently it doesn't work for some xss. The same issue happened in election list when showing the description of the draft election.

With this change, we always show the election description as plain text so that we don't need to sanitize it. Also see related issue with htmlToText in common-ui: [sequentech/common-ui#221](https://github.com/sequentech/common-ui/pull/221) because sometimes we also called to our own htmlToText angular filter, and sanitization was also needed to happen there.

Another fix is to use $sanitize more pervasively in the election creation screen, so that any reply from the server is also not trusted and properly sanitized.

Sorry, something went wrong.

There was an issue with election description. During election creation,
we relied in ng-bind-html to sanitize the visualization of election
description before being sanitized by the backend (because it has not
yet been sent to the backend), but apparently it doesn't work for some
xss. The same issue happened in election list when showing the
description of the drafti election.

With this change, we always show the election description as plain text
so that we don't need to sanitize it. Also see related issue with
htmlToText in common-ui: [sequentech/common-ui#221](https://github.com/sequentech/common-ui/pull/221)
because sometimes we also called to our own htmlToText angular filter,
and sanitization was also needed to happen there.

Another fix is to use $sanitize more pervasively in the election
creation screen, so that any reply from the server is also not trusted
and properly sanitized.

There was an issue with election description. During election creation,

we relied in ng-bind-html to sanitize the visualization of election

description before being sanitized by the backend (because it has not

xss. The same issue happened in election list when showing the

description of the drafti election.

With this change, we always show the election description as plain text

so that we don't need to sanitize it. Also see related issue with

htmlToText in common-ui: [sequentech/common-ui#221](https://github.com/sequentech/common-ui/pull/221)

because sometimes we also called to our own htmlToText angular filter,

and sanitization was also needed to happen there.

Another fix is to use $sanitize more pervasively in the election

creation screen, so that any reply from the server is also not trusted

and properly sanitized.

Sorry, something went wrong.

There was an issue with election description. During election creation,
we relied in ng-bind-html to sanitize the visualization of election
description before being sanitized by the backend (because it has not
yet been sent to the backend), but apparently it doesn't work for some
xss. The same issue happened in election list when showing the
description of the drafti election.

With this change, we always show the election description as plain text
so that we don't need to sanitize it. Also see related issue with
htmlToText in common-ui: https://github.com/sequentech/common-ui/pull/221
because sometimes we also called to our own htmlToText angular filter,
and sanitization was also needed to happen there.

Another fix is to use $sanitize more pervasively in the election
creation screen, so that any reply from the server is also not trusted
