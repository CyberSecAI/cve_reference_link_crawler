- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The AVEVA SuiteLink Server is vulnerable to an allocation of resources without limits or throttling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly limit the allocation of resources, allowing an attacker to consume excessive system resources. This is identified as CWE-770.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to cause the server to consume excessive system resources, preventing the processing of SuiteLink messages on the targeted host and effectively causing a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SuiteLink server.
