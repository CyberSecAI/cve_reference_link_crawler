[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

| CVE | [CVE-2023-0958](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0958) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS | 4.3 (Medium) |
| Publicly Published | July 27, 2023 |

| Researcher | [Chloe Chamberland - Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/researchers/chloe-chamberland) |

### Description

Several plugins for WordPress by Inisev are vulnerable to unauthorized installation of plugins due to a missing capability check on the handle\_installation function that is called via the inisev\_installation AJAX aciton in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as subscribers, to install select plugins from Inisev on vulnerable sites. CVE-2023-38514 appears to be a duplicate of this vulnerability.
