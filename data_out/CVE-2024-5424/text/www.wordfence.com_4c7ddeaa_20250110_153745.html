### Description

The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox. Image Gallery, (HTML5 video , YouTube, Vimeo) Video Gallery and Lightbox for native gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘galleryID’ and 'className' parameters in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
