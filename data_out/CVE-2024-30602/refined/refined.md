The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the Tenda FH1203 V2.0.1.6 firmware, which aligns with the general description of a CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `setSchedWifi` function. The `src` variable, which receives the `schedStartTime` parameter from a POST request, is copied into a fixed-size buffer (`ptr`) using `strcpy`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `strcpy` function copies the attacker controlled `schedStartTime` parameter into a fixed-size buffer without any bounds check.
- Lack of input validation: The `schedStartTime` parameter is not validated for length before being copied, allowing it to exceed the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could overwrite return addresses on the stack, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution. This is achievable due to the lack of any stack canaries, and other stack protections.
- Denial of Service: Overwriting critical data on the stack may lead to a denial of service situation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/openSchedWifi` with an overly long `schedStartTime` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device (i.e. access to the device's network).
- No authentication appears to be required.
