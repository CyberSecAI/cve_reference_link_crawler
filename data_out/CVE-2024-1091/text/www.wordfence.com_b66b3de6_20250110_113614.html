### Description

The ImageRecycle pdf & image compression plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the reinitialize function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to remove all plugin data.
