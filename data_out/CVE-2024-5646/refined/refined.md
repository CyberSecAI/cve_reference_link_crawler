Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5646:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Advanced Text Block" widget of the Futurio Extra WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `header_size` attribute, which determines the HTML tag used for the text block (e.g., `h1`, `h2`, `div`, `span`, `p`), is not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper sanitization of the `header_size` attribute allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by including it within the value of this attribute. This code is then stored in the WordPress database and executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected website.
*   **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies, potentially hijacking user accounts.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Inserting phishing forms/content

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Attribute Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript into the `header_size` attribute of the "Advanced Text Block" widget.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executed when the page containing the widget is rendered in a user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access to the WordPress dashboard to add or modify content using the vulnerable widget and inject the malicious script.
*   **Access to WordPress Admin Panel:** The attacker needs access to the backend of the WordPress site to manipulate the page content.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability is exploited silently, without requiring any action from the victim (other than simply viewing the compromised page).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Futurio Extra plugin up to and including 2.0.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.6 by implementing proper escaping of the `$block` variable and sanitization using `wp_kses_post`
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `inc/elementor/widgets/advanced-text-block.php` file.
*   The fix involves changing `text_block .= '<' . $block . ' class="text-content-block">';` to `text_block .= '<' . esc_html($block) . ' class="text-content-block">';` and `$text_block .= $content;` to `$text_block .= wp_kses_post($content);`
*   The fix also involves addressing XSS vulnerabilities in other widgets by using `esc_html` and `wp_kses_post` to sanitize the text content.
