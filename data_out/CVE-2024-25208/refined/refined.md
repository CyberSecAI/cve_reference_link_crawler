The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25208.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Barangay Population Monitoring System fails to sanitize user-supplied data, specifically the "Full Name" field when adding a new resident.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they access the application.
- This could lead to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials and performing other attacks such as redirecting the user to a malicious site or defacing the web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Full Name" field of the "Add Resident" form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Add Resident" form within the Barangay Population Monitoring System.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, any user that has access to the mentioned page and functionality can exploit it.

**Technical Details:**

- The proof of concept shows how to inject a simple JavaScript payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` into the full name field. This payload will execute the alert function that will display the document's domain.
- The application is hosted locally at `http://localhost/barangay-population-monitoring-system/masterlist.php`.
- The application version is 1.0
- The exploit was tested on Windows 11 Home + PHP 8.2.12, Apache 2.4.58
