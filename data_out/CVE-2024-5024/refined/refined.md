Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `mepr_screenname` and `mepr_key` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `mepr_screenname` and `mepr_key` parameters before displaying it back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages.
*   **User Compromise:** When a user clicks a crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
*   **Potential Actions:** This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious websites, deface the website, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious JavaScript in the `mepr_screenname` or `mepr_key` parameters.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker has to trick a user into clicking the malicious link. This can be done via email, social media or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:**  The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific user role on the target website.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the MemberPress plugin up to and including version 1.11.29.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.11.30.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researcher stealthcopter.

This vulnerability is considered a **Medium** severity issue.
