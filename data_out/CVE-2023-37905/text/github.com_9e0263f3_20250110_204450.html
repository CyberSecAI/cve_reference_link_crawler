# Cross-Site Scripting in CKEditor4 WordCount Plugin

Moderate

[ohader](/ohader)
published
GHSA-m8fw-p3cr-6jqc
Jul 25, 2023

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-rte-ckeditor
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

9.5.0-9.5.41, 10.0.0-10.4.38, 11.0.0-11.5.29

## Patched versions

9.5.42, 10.4.39, 11.5.30

## Description

> ### CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (4.4)

### Problem

The [WordCount](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/wordcount) plugin ([`npm:ckeditor-wordcount-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor-wordcount-plugin)) for CKEditor4 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting when switching to the source code mode. This plugin is enabled via the `Full.yaml` configuration present, but is not active in the default configuration.

In default scenarios, exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account. However, if custom plugins are used on the website frontend, which accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required.

### Solution

Update to TYPO3 versions 9.5.42 ELTS, 10.4.39 ELTS, 11.5.30 that fix the problem described above.

### Credits

Thanks to Sybille Peters who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
