Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2023-37905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of HTML content within the CKEditor4 WordCount plugin when switching to source code mode, which leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw.
- The `ckeditor-wordcount-plugin`  does not properly sanitize HTML input, specifically when a user switches from the WYSIWYG editor to the source code view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the editor.
- If successful, this code can execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view content containing the malicious script, potentially leading to:
    - Data theft (e.g. session hijacking).
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious actions within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves manipulating content within the CKEditor.
- An attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript code, which then gets executed in the context of a user who views this content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Default Scenario:**  In a standard setup, the attacker requires a valid backend user account to inject the malicious code through the editor.
- **Frontend Scenario:** If a website uses custom plugins that allow users to submit and display rich-text content without proper sanitization on the frontend, an attacker would not require backend access to inject malicious code.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the editor to include malicious code and then save or switch to the source view.
- User interaction is required (a user must view the content containing the malicious script for the XSS to be triggered).

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in the `ckeditor-wordcount-plugin` up to version 1.17.11.
- The vulnerability is fixed in `ckeditor-wordcount-plugin` version 1.17.12 and in TYPO3 versions 9.5.42, 10.4.39, and 11.5.30.
- The vulnerability is present because the `WordCount` plugin is enabled via the `Full.yaml` configuration, although not enabled by default.
- The issue was reported by Sybille Peters, and fixed by Oliver Hader.
- The CVSS score is listed as 4.4 (Moderate) for TYPO3 and 6.1 (Moderate) for the plugin itself.
