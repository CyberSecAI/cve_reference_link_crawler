Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check within a function of the WordPress Custom Query Blocks plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  Specifically, there's a failure to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform a certain action.
*   **Missing Authentication Checks**:  The plugin does not properly check that the user is logged in before allowing them to perform a certain action.
*  **Missing Nonce Token Check:** The absence of nonce verification means that the action being performed is not checked for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to execute privileged actions. While the specific impact is described as "case by case", this could lead to a range of consequences, including modifying website content, gaining unauthorized access to data, or potentially escalating privileges depending on what specific actions can be executed without proper validation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable function in the plugin that lacks proper access control.
*   The specific function is not named, but is described as one where unauthorized users can execute privileged actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any account or be logged into the WordPress website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
*   The vulnerable versions of the plugin are <= 5.2.0.
*   The fix is available in version 5.3.0.
*   A virtual patch is available through Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability until the plugin is updated.
