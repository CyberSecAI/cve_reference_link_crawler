Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-31690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Spring Security handles OAuth2 access token responses, specifically when the Authorization Server responds with an empty scope list. This can lead to a privilege escalation when the client application uses authorization rules based on the scopes returned in the access token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user can manipulate a request to the Authorization Server, causing it to respond with an empty scope list. This allows the malicious user to bypass authorization checks that rely on the presence of specific scopes.
- **Improper Handling of Empty Scopes:** The Spring Security client does not properly handle the case where an Authorization Server returns an access token with an empty scope list.
- **Dependency on Client-Side Scope Mapping:** The vulnerability exists in applications that map authorities based on scopes received from the authorization server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions that should be restricted based on their intended roles/permissions.
- **Data modification/disclosure:**  As described in the NetApp advisory, this could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack occurs over the network between the client application and the authorization server.
- **Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates a request initiated by the client to the Authorization Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or modify the request initiated by the client towards the authorization server.
- The attacker would need to be a malicious user of the client application in order to initiate the OAuth flow.
- The targeted application must be configured as an OAuth2 client that utilizes authorization rules based on scopes and communicates with an authorization server which may respond with empty scopes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects applications using `http.oauth2Login()`.
- It does not affect applications acting as a resource server only (using `http.oauth2ResourceServer()`).
- It does not affect applications using authorization rules with authorities not mapped from authorized scopes (e.g., `anyRequest().hasAuthority("ROLE_USER")`).
- The vulnerability is present in Spring Security versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5, and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9, as well as older unsupported versions.
