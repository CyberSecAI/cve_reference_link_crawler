# CVE-2022-31690: Privilege Escalation in spring-security-oauth2-client

HIGH | OCTOBER 31, 2022 | CVE-2022-31690
# Description

Spring Security, versions **5.7** prior to **5.7.5**, and **5.6** prior to **5.6.9**, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can modify a request initiated by the Client (via the browser) to the Authorization Server which can lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the Authorization Server responds with an OAuth2 Access Token Response containing an empty scope list (per [RFC 6749, Section 5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.1)) on the subsequent request to the token endpoint to obtain the access token.

This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements:

* Act in the role of a Login Client (e.g. `http.oauth2Login()`)
* Use one or more authorization rules with authorities mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority("SCOPE_message.write")`) in the client application
* Register an authorization server that responds with empty scopes list (per RFC 6749, Section 5.1)

This vulnerability **does not** expose applications that:

* Act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. `http.oauth2ResourceServer()`)
* Use authorization rules with authorities not mapped from authorized scopes (e.g. `anyRequest().hasAuthority("ROLE_USER")`) in the client application

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Security
  + 5.7 to 5.7.4
  + 5.6 to 5.6.8
  + Older, unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: Spring Security 5.7 to 5.7.5, Spring Security 5.6 to 5.6.9. Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch. There are no other mitigation steps required. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Security
  + 5.7.5
  + 5.6.9
