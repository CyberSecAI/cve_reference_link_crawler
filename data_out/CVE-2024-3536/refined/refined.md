Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `selector` parameter within the `/admin/delete_log.php` file of the Church Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `selector` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Successful exploitation could lead to the leakage of sensitive user data or system information.
- **System Compromise:** The injected SQL code could potentially be used to compromise the overall security of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `/admin/delete_log.php` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `selector` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `selector` parameter. No specific user level is mentioned but it is within the `/admin/` path.
- The provided payload suggests that the attacker can leverage the SQL injection to execute arbitrary queries including time-based blind SQL injection using `SLEEP()`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is "campcodes Church Management System version â‰¤1.0".
- The provided payload is `selector[]='%2B(select(0)from(select(sleep(2)))v)%2B'`, which uses `sleep(2)` to confirm the injection is working.
