The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41011.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect offset calculation when mapping the MMIO HDP page on systems using large page sizes (greater than 4KB). The GPU has a 4KB unused region in its register BAR, where HDP flush registers are remapped to enable userspace to flush the HDP when updating VRAM. However, with large pages, a larger-than-intended MMIO space gets exposed, leading to potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect MMIO mapping: When using page sizes larger than 4KB, the driver maps a larger region of MMIO space than intended due to an incorrect offset calculation. This exposes more of the register BAR space to userspace.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can allow userspace to potentially access and manipulate MMIO registers that it shouldn't have access to. This could lead to various issues like system instability or unauthorized hardware control.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious userspace application can leverage this vulnerability by using memory mapping to access the expanded MMIO region.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code in userspace.
- The system needs to have a page size larger than 4KB configured.
