- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `importCertificate` function in the SINEC NMS Control web application does not properly sanitize or validate the file paths provided during certificate import.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary certificate files on the drive where SINEC NMS is installed.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the web application interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the SINEC NMS control web application.
