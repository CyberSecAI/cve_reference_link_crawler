{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `get_free_serial_index()` function would return an available minor number, but not assign it immediately, leading to multiple ttys trying to claim the same minor number.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition when allocating minor numbers for tty devices"
    ],
    "impact": "A double unregistration of the same device, leading to a null-pointer dereference and system crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "Multiple tty devices are created, attempting to claim the same minor number.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger creation of multiple tty devices within a short timeframe."
  },
  "affected_component": "HSO driver (drivers/net/usb/hso.c)",
  "fix": "The `get_free_serial_index` function was modified to assign the minor number immediately after one is found to be available and renamed to `obtain_minor()`. The `set_serial_by_index` function was renamed to `release_minor()` and modified to free up the minor number of the given `hso_serial`"
