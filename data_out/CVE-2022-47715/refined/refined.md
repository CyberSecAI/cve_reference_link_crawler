- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `LastYardVersion` cookie is missing the `Secure` flag.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The absence of the `Secure` flag on the `LastYardVersion` cookie allows it to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could intercept the `LastYardVersion` cookie when transmitted over unencrypted channels, potentially leading to unauthorized access or session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on unencrypted HTTP connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic between the user and the server.
