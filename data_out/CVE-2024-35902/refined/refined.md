{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `__rds_rdma_map` function within the net/rds module. The `cp` parameter passed to this function can be NULL in certain call paths. When `ret` is `-ENODEV` and `cp` is NULL, accessing `cp->cp_conn` leads to a null pointer dereference, potentially crashing the system or causing unexpected behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service, as the system may crash due to the null pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by specific operations within the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) subsystem, specifically when allocating memory regions for RDMA operations using `rds_get_mr` or `rds_get_mr_for_dest` with a NULL connection parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger RDMA operations through the RDS subsystem, specifically ones involving `rds_get_mr` or `rds_get_mr_for_dest` and result in a -ENODEV return code. This implies the attacker needs to be able to interact with the RDS subsystem at some level, potentially requiring local access to the system."
  },
  "fix": "The fix adds a check for a NULL `cp` parameter before attempting to access `cp->cp_conn` within the `__rds_rdma_map` function to prevent the null pointer dereference when ret is `-ENODEV`.",
  "cve": "CVE-2024-35902"
