{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress WP GDPR Compliance plugin <= 2.0.23 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful CSRF attack allows a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the actions the user is tricked into performing.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a malicious web page or link, tricking an authenticated user into visiting it. This will then send a forged request to the vulnerable plugin on behalf of the user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the website itself."
