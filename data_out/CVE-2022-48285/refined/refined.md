  "CVE-2022-48285": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a zip slip vulnerability in the `jszip` library that occurs when processing filenames loaded with `loadAsync` function which could allow an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations outside of the intended directory.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `jszip` library did not properly sanitize filenames containing relative path components (e.g., `..`) when loading a zip archive using the `loadAsync` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of relative paths",
        "Zip slip vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious zip archive containing files with relative paths that, when extracted using `jszip`, could write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory leading to potential overwriting of system files or code execution depending on the context of the application.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by loading a malicious zip archive containing filenames with relative path components using the `loadAsync` method.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to create a malicious zip archive and have it processed by a vulnerable application or system using the affected version of the library."
