Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2846

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks when creating events in the "Calendar Event Multi View" WordPress plugin, combined with insufficient sanitization and escaping of event fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:**  Unauthenticated users can create arbitrary events.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to forge requests on behalf of users.
*   **Stored XSS:** The plugin fails to sanitize and properly escape input in event fields, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be stored and executed when the event is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Event Creation:** An attacker can create events on the calendar without needing to be logged in or authorized.
*   **Stored XSS:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a website userâ€™s browser when the crafted event is viewed. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, sensitive information theft, website defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated HTTP POST request:** The attacker can send an HTTP POST request to the server using crafted input parameters to create a malicious event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be a registered user or be logged in.
*   **Knowledge of the URL parameters:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft the malicious HTTP POST request including parameters, to create malicious calendar events.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to construct the malicious POST request.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a "No Authorisation" issue.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP Top 10 (A5: Broken Access Control) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
*   The issue is rated with a CVSS score of 7.1 (High).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.07 of the plugin.
