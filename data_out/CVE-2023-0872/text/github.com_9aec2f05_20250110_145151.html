### Contribution Checklist

* Please [make an issue in the OpenNMS issue tracker](https://opennms.atlassian.net/) if there isn't one already.
  Once there is an issue, please:

  2. update the Jira link at the bottom of this comment to refer to the real issue number
  3. prefix your commit messages with the issue number, if possible

     Don't worry if this sounds like a lot, we can help you get things set up properly.
* **If this code is likely to affect the UI, did you name your branch with `-smoke` in it to trigger smoke tests?**
* If this is a new or updated feature, is there documentation for the new behavior?
* If this is new code, are there unit and/or integration tests?
