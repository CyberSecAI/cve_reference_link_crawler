The provided content is related to CVE-2022-26272.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Encryption Key" parameter on the installation page is not properly filtered. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary strings into the `application/config/config.php` file during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The application fails to sanitize or validate the "Encryption Key" input field during installation, allowing for arbitrary string injection.
- Direct file writing: The application directly writes the user-provided, unsanitized "Encryption Key" into the configuration file `application/config/config.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By injecting malicious PHP code into the configuration file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. The provided example payload demonstrates this by injecting `';system($_GET['cmd']);//` , which allows execution of shell commands via a GET request.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: The vulnerability is exposed through the web-based installation interface of Ionize, specifically during user settings configuration at `/install/?step=user&lang=en`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the web installation page before the installation process is complete.
- The attacker must be able to input text into the "Encryption Key" field on the installation page.
