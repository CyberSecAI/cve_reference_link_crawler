Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Unauthorized Command Execution in `/cmd.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper authorization and input validation in `/var/www/cmd.php`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Allows execution of arbitrary CLI commands.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can modify network configurations and reset login credentials for the web interface and SSH.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/cmd.php` with a crafted `cmd` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable server.

**Vulnerability 2: Command Injection in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi`**

*   **Root Cause:** User-supplied filename from file upload is appended to a command without filtering, then executed using `popen`.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Command injection vulnerability via a crafted filename.
*    **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server. An attacker could write a webshell to the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` with a crafted filename within the `uploadedFile` field.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to authenticate to the device (e.g. using default credentials after exploiting vulnerability 1) and network access to the vulnerable server.

**Vulnerability 3: Command Injection in `/admin/system.html`**

*   **Root Cause:** The filename of an uploaded file is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.
*  **Weaknesses:** Command injection vulnerability through a file upload with a malicious filename.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/admin/system.html` with a crafted filename within the `uploadedFile` field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable server and valid authentication using Digest authentication.

**Summary**

The content details three distinct vulnerabilities in the Alien Technology ALR-F800 RFID reader:

1.  An unauthorized command execution vulnerability allowing password reset.
2.  Two command injection vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary command execution via file uploads with crafted filenames.

These vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve full system compromise. For example, the first vulnerability can be used to gain access to the device, and the command injection vulnerability can then be leveraged to execute arbitrary system commands.
