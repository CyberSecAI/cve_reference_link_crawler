### Description

The Master Addons – Free Widgets, Hover Effects, Toggle, Conditions, Animations for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ma-template' REST API route in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create or modify existing Master Addons templates or make settings modifications related to these templates.
