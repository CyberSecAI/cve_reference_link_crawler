Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2024-36053**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of the service name within the `check_connection()`, `drop_data_received_cb()`, and `Service.remove()` functions in `mintupload`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to the use of `os.system()` with unsanitized input in the mentioned functions.
- Specifically, the service name, which can be modified by users, is directly incorporated into shell commands without proper sanitization, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running `mintupload`.
- This can lead to a full system compromise if the user is an administrator, or to data exfiltration and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to modify the service name within the `~/.linuxmint/mintUpload/services/service` file.
- The vulnerable functions are triggered by:
    - Clicking "Check connection" on a service.
    - Dropping a file (invoking `drop_data_received_cb()`).
    - Removing a service (invoking `Service.remove()`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system to modify the service configuration file.
-  No special privileges are required to perform the attack, it can be performed by a normal user.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched by replacing `os.system()` with `subprocess.run()`, which provides safer command execution by preventing shell injection.
- A temporary revert of the fix was performed as it broke functionality and later corrected again.
