- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formWifiWpsOOB` function in the Tenda AC15V1.0 V15.03.20_multi firmware has a stack overflow vulnerability due to the insecure use of the `sprintf` function. The `index` parameter from a POST request is directly used in `sprintf` to copy data to a local variable on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow. The `sprintf` function copies a user-provided string `nptr` (from POST parameter `index`) to a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow when the input is larger than the buffer size.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By sending a long string as the `index` parameter, the attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to redirect execution to arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/WifiWpsOOB` with a long string as the value of the `index` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. This usually requires network access to the device, which could be on the same local network or via remote access if the device is exposed.
