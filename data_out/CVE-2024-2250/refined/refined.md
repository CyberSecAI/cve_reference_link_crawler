Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2250

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "130+ Widgets | Best Addons For Elementor – FREE" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape URL parameters in various widgets, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through unsanitized user inputs are stored in the database and executed when a user views a page containing the affected widget.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-supplied data, specifically URLs, before storing them.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:**  The plugin does not properly escape user-supplied data when outputting it in HTML, allowing injected scripts to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access a page with a compromised widget.
- **Account Hijacking:** This could potentially lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other harmful actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could inject code to deface or modify the appearance and functionality of the affected pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Widgets:** The vulnerability is present within the various widgets of the plugin
- **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious code through user-controlled attributes within the plugin’s widget settings, specifically through URL fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers must have a WordPress account with at least "Contributor" level permissions or higher.
- **Access to Widget Settings:** Attackers need the ability to edit pages and configure the affected plugin's widgets. This is typically achievable with contributor-level access which allows content creation/editing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.2.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.3 by applying `esc_url()` to the vulnerable URL fields.
- The vulnerable files are in the `xpro-elementor-addons/trunk/widgets/` directory

**Summary:**
The "130+ Widgets | Best Addons For Elementor – FREE" WordPress plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to a lack of input sanitization and output escaping on URL fields within its widgets. Authenticated users with contributor-level permissions can inject malicious scripts into pages, potentially leading to account hijacking, website defacement, or other harmful actions. The vulnerability is resolved in version 1.4.3 with the addition of `esc_url()` to sanitize the URL inputs.
