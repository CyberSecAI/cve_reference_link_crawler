I just upgraded to PHP 8.0 from 7.4 and when I did, this plugin caused the site to go down with a critical error. When I disable the plugin, everything is fine.

### [Pro versions doesn’t work](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pro-versions-doesnt-work/)

Installation instructions require a manual upload into the backend of wordpress and they say “Please download archive and install it on your wordpress website in plugin management section. This plugin enable full set of premium features in plugin.”
Being a reasonably well versed WP developer, I presume this means into the 2j-slideshow plugin directory.
1) You shouldn’t need to ftp a file onto your site to get a license working
2) They should give clear step by step instructions. The FAQ on their website goes to an error page
No reply from my support ticket after 24hrs. My client is getting impatient.
Time to get a refund and find another plugin. This is a WASTE OF MY TIME and why I decided to go for a Pro version in the first place!
!! AVOID !!

So I bought the premium version of this plugin but I never received the product/license. They just took my money and said bye.
I’ve contacted them 24 hours ago but have yet to receive a reply.
I really hope I don’t get scammed. Will update this review when there are any updates.

### Description

The Slideshow, Image Slider by 2J plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘post’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.3.54 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
