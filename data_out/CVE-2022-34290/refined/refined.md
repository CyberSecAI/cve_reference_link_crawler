- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack corruption while parsing PCB files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information leak in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted PCB file with the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious PCB file. This means the attacker needs to be able to deliver such a file to the victim.
