# Detection: Splunk DOS via printf search function

Updated Date: 2024-10-17

Author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Splunk
[Type: Hunting](#default-configuration)
[Product: Splunk Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/enterprise-security.html)
### Description

The following analytic identifies the use of the `printf` SPL function in Splunk searches, which can be exploited for a denial of service (DoS) attack. It detects this activity by querying the `audit_searches` data source for specific patterns involving `makeresults`, `eval`, `fieldformat`, and `printf` functions, excluding searches by the `splunk_system_user`. This activity is significant because it targets a known vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 8.1.14, 8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1, potentially disrupting the availability of the Splunk instance. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to service outages and impact the monitoring and logging capabilities of the organization.

### Search

```
1`audit_searches` "*makeresults * eval * fieldformat *printf*" user!="splunk_system_user" search!="*audit_searches*"
2| stats count by user splunk_server host search
3| convert ctime(*time)
4|`splunk_dos_via_printf_search_function_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [audit\_searches](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/audit_searches.yml) | `index=_audit sourcetype=audittrail action=search` |
| splunk\_dos\_via\_printf\_search\_function\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_dos_via_printf_search_function_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

This search requires the ability to search internal indexes.

### Known False Positives

This search may produces false positives, analyst most focuse in the use of printf conversion function of eval to craft an expression that splunkd cannot interpret correctly causing it to crash.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Possible denial of service attack against $host$ | 100 | 100 | 100 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
