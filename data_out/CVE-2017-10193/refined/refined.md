{
  "CVE-2017-10193": {
    "Root cause": "An incorrect key size constraint check in the Security component of OpenJDK.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Security component of OpenJDK fails to properly validate the key size for certain cryptographic operations."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to bypass security checks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access is required to reach vulnerable Java endpoints/applications."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker requires the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path and manipulate the parameters.",
      "User interaction is required."
    ]
  }
