# A potential risk of external-secrets which can be leveraged to make a privilege escalation

Moderate

## Package

gomod

external-secrets
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

master branch

## Patched versions

v0.10.2

## Description

### Summary

I am Nanzi Yang, a PostDoc of UMN, and I find a potential risk of external-secrets which can be leveraged to make cluster-level privilege escalations.

### Details

The external-secrets has a deployment called default-external-secrets-cert-controller, which is bound with a same-name ClusterRole. This ClusterRole has "get/list" verbs of secrets resources(<https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L49>). It also has path/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations resources(<https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/deploy/charts/external-secrets/templates/cert-controller-rbac.yaml#L27>). As a result, if a malicious user can access the worker node which has this deployment. he/she can:

1. For the "get/list secrets" permission, he/she can abuse the SA token of this deployment to retrieve or get ALL secrets in the whole cluster, including the cluster-admin secret if created. After that, he/she can abuse the cluster-admin secret to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation.
2. For the patch/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations, the malicious user can abuse these permissions to get sensitive data or lanuch DoS attacks:

For the privilege escalation attack, by updating/patching a Webhook to make it listen to Secret update operations, the attacker can capture and log all data from requests attempting to update Secrets. More specifically, when a Secret is updated, this Webhook sends the request data to the logging-service, which can then log the content of the Secret. This way, an attacker could indirectly gain access to the full contents of the Secret.

For the DoS attack, by updating/patching a Webhook, and making it deny all Pod create and update requests, the attacker can prevent any new Pods from being created or existing Pods from being updated, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### PoC

Please see the "Details" section

### Impact

Privilege escalation

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-45041

### Weaknesses

[CWE-269](/advisories?query=cwe%3A269)
