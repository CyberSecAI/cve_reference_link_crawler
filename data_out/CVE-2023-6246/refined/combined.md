    CUT MY LIST IN TWO PIECES
    THAT'S HOW YOU START QUICK SORT
        -- <https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1710447650112438710>

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a memory corruption in the glibc's qsort() function, due
to a missing bounds check. To be vulnerable, a program must call qsort()
with a nontransitive comparison function (a function cmp(int a, int b)
that returns (a - b), for example) and with a large number of attacker-
controlled elements (to cause a malloc() failure inside qsort()). We
have not tried to find such a vulnerable program in the real world.

All glibc versions from at least September 1992 (glibc 1.04) to the
current release (glibc 2.38) are affected, but the glibc's developers
have independently discovered and patched this memory corruption in the
master branch (commit b9390ba, "stdlib: Fix array bounds protection in
insertion sort phase of qsort") during a recent refactoring of qsort().

About our advisory, the glibc security team issues the following
statement:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This memory corruption in the GNU C Library through the qsort function is
invoked by an application passing a non-transitive comparison function, which
is undefined according to POSIX and ISO C standards.  As a result, we are of
the opinion that the resulting CVE, if any, should be assigned to any such
calling applications and subsequently fixed by passing a valid comparison
function to qsort and not to glibc.  We however acknowledge that this is a
quality of implementation issue and we fixed this in a recent refactor of
qsort.  We would like to thank Qualys for sharing their findings and helping
us validate our recent changes to qsort.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
Background
========================================================================

While browsing through Postfix's HISTORY file, we stumbled across a
puzzling entry from February 2002:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Bugfix: make all recipient comparisons transitive, because
        Solaris qsort() causes SIGSEGV errors otherwise. Victor
        Duchovni, Morgan Stanley. File: *qmgr/qmgr_message.c.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segmentation faults in qsort()? Transitive comparison functions?

As explained in the manual page for qsort(), "The comparison function
must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
first argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or
greater than the second." Of course, such a comparison function cmp()
must be transitive:

- if a < b (i.e., if cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) < 0);

- and if b < c (i.e., if cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) < 0);

- then necessarily a < c (i.e., cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c)) < 0).

For example, the following comparison function (which compares integers)
is transitive (and perfectly correct):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
int
cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
{
    const int a = *(const int *)pa;
    const int b = *(const int *)pb;
    if (a > b) return +1;
    if (a < b) return -1;
    return 0;
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A shorter and more efficient version of this comparison function could
simply "return (a > b) - (a < b);" and still be transitive and perfectly
correct:

- if a > b, it returns 1 - 0 = +1;

- if a < b, it returns 0 - 1 = -1;

- if a = b, it returns 0 - 0 = 0.

The question, then, is: how can a comparison function be nontransitive?
A comparison function cmp() is nontransitive if there exist a, b, and c
such that:

- a < b (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) < 0);

- b < c (because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) < 0);

- but a >= c (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c)) >= 0 by
  mistake).

Although the following comparison function seems correct at first, it is
in fact nontransitive, because the subtraction in "return (a - b);" is
prone to integer overflows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
int
cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
{
    const int a = *(const int *)pa;
    const int b = *(const int *)pb;
    return (a - b);
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if a = INT_MIN, b = 0, and c = INT_MAX, then:

- a < b (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) returns INT_MIN - 0,
  which is correctly negative);

- b < c (because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(c)) returns 0 - INT_MAX,
  which is also correctly negative);

- but a > c by mistake (because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(c))
  returns INT_MIN - INT_MAX = +1, which is incorrectly positive because
  this subtraction overflows).

Unfortunately, such nontransitive comparison functions are extremely
common, as discussed in this excellent blog post from Ted Unangst:

  <https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/subtraction-is-not-comparison>

and as hinted at in OpenBSD's manual page for qsort(): "It is almost
always an error to use subtraction to compute the return value of the
comparison function."

Fortunately, when passed to a robust qsort() implementation, these
nontransitive comparison functions should (at the worst) result in an
incorrectly sorted array; certainly not in a memory corruption. However,
the aforementioned entry from Postfix's HISTORY file suggests that not
all qsort() implementations are robust.

========================================================================
Experiments
========================================================================

We therefore decided to assess the robustness of the glibc's qsort()
implementation, by calling it with a nontransitive comparison function:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 #include <limits.h>
  2 #include <stdlib.h>
  3 #include <sys/time.h>
  4
  5 static int
  6 cmp(const void * const pa, const void * const pb)
  7 {
  8     const int a = *(const int *)pa;
  9     const int b = *(const int *)pb;
 10     return (a - b);
 11 }
 12
 13 int
 14 main(const int argc, const char * const argv[])
 15 {
 16     if (argc != 2) return __LINE__;
 17     const size_t nmemb = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 0);
 18     if (nmemb <= 0 || nmemb >= (1<<28)) return __LINE__;
 19
 20     int * const pcanary1 = calloc(1 + nmemb + 1, sizeof(int));
 21     if (!pcanary1) return __LINE__;
 22     int * const array = pcanary1 + 1;
 23     int * const pcanary2 = array + nmemb;
 24
 25     struct timeval tv;
 26     if (gettimeofday(&tv, NULL)) return __LINE__;
 27     srandom((tv.tv_sec << 16) ^ tv.tv_usec);
 28
 29     const int canary1 = *pcanary1 = (random() << 16) ^ random();
 30     const int canary2 = *pcanary2 = (random() << 16) ^ random();
 31     array[random() % nmemb] = INT_MIN;
 32
 33     qsort(array, nmemb, sizeof(int), cmp);
 34     if (*pcanary1 != canary1) abort();
 35     if (*pcanary2 != canary2) abort();
 36     return 0;
 37 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 5-11, cmp() is the nontransitive comparison function
  introduced in the previous "Background" section;

- at lines 16-18, the number of elements to be sorted (simple integers)
  is read from the command line;

- at lines 20-23, the array of elements to be sorted is calloc()ated,
  along with a canary element below this array, and a canary element
  above this array;

- at lines 29-30, these two canary elements are randomized, and copied
  to the stack for later comparison;

- at line 31, one random element of the array is initialized to INT_MIN
  (all other elements are initialized to 0 by calloc());

- at line 33, the elements of this array are sorted by qsort();

- at lines 34-35, the two canary elements (below and above the sorted
  array) are checked against their stack copies, and if they differ (an
  out-of-bounds write in qsort()), abort() is called.

We chose the array elements a = INT_MIN and b = 0 because they directly
exhibit the problematic behavior of this cmp() function:

- a < b, because cmp(pointer_to(a), pointer_to(b)) returns INT_MIN - 0,
  which is correctly negative;

- but b < a by mistake, because cmp(pointer_to(b), pointer_to(a))
  returns 0 - INT_MIN = INT_MIN (the "Leblancian Paradox"), which is
  incorrectly negative (because this subtraction overflows).

We then executed our test program in a loop, on Fedora 39 (which uses
the latest glibc version, 2.38):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ while true; do n=$((RANDOM*64+RANDOM+1)); ./qsort $n; done
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unsurprisingly, nothing happened: our program did not crash or abort().
While this loop was still running (and not crashing), we started to read
the glibc's qsort() implementation; to our great surprise, we discovered
that the glibc's qsort() is not, in fact, a quick sort by default, but a
merge sort (in stdlib/msort.c).

Most likely, merge sort was chosen over quick sort to avoid quick sort's
worst-case performance, which is O(n^2); on the other hand, merge sort's
worst-case performance is O(n*log(n)). But merge sort suffers from one
major drawback: it does not sort in-place -- it malloc()ates a copy of
the array of elements to be sorted. As a result, if this array is very
large (lines 212-217), or if this malloc() fails (lines 219-229), then
the glibc's qsort() falls back to a quick sort (in stdlib/qsort.c),
because quick sort does sort in-place:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
163 void
164 __qsort_r (void *b, size_t n, size_t s, __compar_d_fn_t cmp, void *arg)
165 {
166   size_t size = n * s;
...
170   /* For large object sizes use indirect sorting.  */
171   if (s > 32)
172     size = 2 * n * sizeof (void *) + s;
173
174   if (size < 1024)
175     /* The temporary array is small, so put it on the stack.  */
176     p.t = __alloca (size);
177   else
178     {
...
212       /* If the memory requirements are too high don't allocate memory.  */
213       if (size / pagesize > (size_t) phys_pages)
214         {
215           _quicksort (b, n, s, cmp, arg);
216           return;
217         }
218
219       /* It's somewhat large, so malloc it.  */
220       int save = errno;
221       tmp = malloc (size);
222       __set_errno (save);
223       if (tmp == NULL)
224         {
225           /* Couldn't get space, so use the slower algorithm
226              that doesn't need a temporary array.  */
227           _quicksort (b, n, s, cmp, arg);
228           return;
229         }
230       p.t = tmp;
231     }
...
299 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We therefore decided to assess the robustness of the glibc's quick sort
(instead of its merge sort, which was clearly not crashing), by forcing
qsort() to call _quicksort(). Locally, forcing the malloc() at line 221
to fail is very easy: we simply execute our program with a low RLIMIT_AS
("The maximum size of the process's virtual memory", man setrlimit); and
this works even when executing a SUID-root program. So we executed our
program in the following loop instead:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ while true; do n=$((RANDOM*64+RANDOM+1)); prlimit --as=$((n*4/2*3)) ./qsort $n; done
Aborted (core dumped)
Aborted (core dumped)
Aborted (core dumped)
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incredibly, we almost immediately observed crashes of our test program:
calls to abort(), because one of our canary elements (below or above the
sorted array) was overwritten (i.e., an out-of-bounds write in qsort()).
To understand these crashes, we examined one of them in gdb:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ gdb prlimit
(gdb) run --as=8104854 ./qsort 1350809

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at address 0x7ffff78af010 (pcanary1), the original value of the canary
  (0xc6109e4c) was overwritten with 0x0 -- an out-of-bounds write;

- at address 0x7ffff78af00c (below pcanary1), the most significant word
  of an mchunk_size (heap metadata) was overwritten with 0x80000000
  (INT_MIN) -- another out-of-bounds write;

- at address 0x7ffff78af014 (above pcanary1), the first element of the
  array was overwritten with 0xc6109e4c (the original value of the
  canary), which was therefore read out-of-bounds beforehand (from
  pcanary1).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

To identify the root cause of these out-of-bounds memory accesses, we
must analyze the implementation of the glibc's quick sort:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 87 void
 88 _quicksort (void *const pbase, size_t total_elems, size_t size,
 89             __compar_d_fn_t cmp, void *arg)
 90 {
 91   char *base_ptr = (char *) pbase;
...
108       while (STACK_NOT_EMPTY)
109         {
...
193         }
...
206     char *tmp_ptr = base_ptr;
...
214     for (run_ptr = tmp_ptr + size; run_ptr <= thresh; run_ptr += size)
215       if ((*cmp) ((void *) run_ptr, (void *) tmp_ptr, arg) < 0)
216         tmp_ptr = run_ptr;
217
218     if (tmp_ptr != base_ptr)
219       SWAP (tmp_ptr, base_ptr, size);
...
223     run_ptr = base_ptr + size;
224     while ((run_ptr += size) <= end_ptr)
225       {
226         tmp_ptr = run_ptr - size;
227         while ((*cmp) ((void *) run_ptr, (void *) tmp_ptr, arg) < 0)
228           tmp_ptr -= size;
...
246       }
...
248 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 108-193, when quick sort's partitions become smaller than
  MAX_THRESH (4 elements), _quicksort() switches to a final insertion
  sort (at lines 206-246), which is faster than quick sort for small or
  mostly sorted arrays;

- at lines 206-219, this insertion sort makes sure that the very first
  element of the array (base_ptr) is the smallest element of the array;

- at lines 226-228, this first element acts as a natural barrier that
  prevents tmp_ptr from being decremented below the array (because if
  tmp_ptr reaches base_ptr, then necessarily cmp(run_ptr, tmp_ptr) >= 0
  because tmp_ptr is base_ptr, the smallest element of the array);

- unfortunately this does not hold true if cmp() is nontransitive, in
  which case cmp(run_ptr, tmp_ptr) can be < 0 even if tmp_ptr is
  base_ptr, so tmp_ptr can be decremented below the array, where
  out-of-bounds elements are read and overwritten.

========================================================================
Patch
========================================================================

To patch these out-of-bounds memory accesses in _quicksort(), a simple
check "tmp_ptr > base_ptr &&" can be added in front of the cmp() call at
line 227 (of course this does not magically result in a correctly sorted
array if cmp() is nontransitive, but at least it does not result in a
memory corruption anymore).

In fact, while drafting this advisory, we discovered that such a check
("tmp_ptr != base_ptr &&") has already been added to the glibc's master
branch (which will become glibc 2.39 in February 2024), by the following
commit ("stdlib: Fix array bounds protection in insertion sort phase of
qsort"):

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=b9390ba93676c4b1e87e218af5e7e4bb596312ac>

Indeed, the glibc developers have recently refactored qsort() and
replaced the merge sort (and its fallback to quick sort) with an
introspective sort (a combination of quick sort, heap sort, and
insertion sort):

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introsort>
  <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2023-October/151907.html>

During this refactoring, the glibc developers have proactively
discovered (and patched) the out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
insertion sort (probably because these out-of-bounds memory accesses
became directly exposed to the misbehavior of nontransitive comparison
functions, instead of being safely hidden behind a malloc() failure in
the merge sort).

Last-minute note: in January 2024, the glibc developers have reverted
this refactoring of qsort(), back to the original merge sort, plus a
fallback to heap sort instead of quick sort; for more information:

  <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2024-January/154051.html>

========================================================================
Discussion
========================================================================

We have not tried to find a vulnerable program (i.e., a program that
uses a nontransitive comparison function to qsort() attacker-controlled
elements); however, vulnerable programs are certain to exist in the real
world:

- calls to qsort() are extremely common;

- nontransitive comparison functions are also common;

- all glibc versions from at least September 1992 (glibc 1.04, the first
  version that we could find online) to the current release (glibc 2.38)
  are affected by this memory corruption.

Locally, forcing a malloc() failure in qsort() (which is necessary to
reach the memory corruption) is easy: either execute the target program
(e.g., a SUID-root program) with a low RLIMIT_AS, or allocate a large
amount of memory with another program on the same machine.

Remotely, forcing this malloc() failure is harder: either allocate a
large amount of memory (e.g., a memory leak) in the network service that
is being targeted, or in another network service on the same machine.

Timeline
========================================================================

2023-12-12: We sent a draft of our advisory to the glibc security team.
They immediately acknowledged receipt of our email.

2023-12-19: The glibc security team decided to not treat this memory
corruption in qsort() as a vulnerability in the glibc itself, as
explained in the "Summary" of our advisory.

2024-01-16: We backported commit b9390ba to all current and past stable
versions of the glibc, and sent this patch and a draft of our advisory
to the linux-distros@openwall (to piggyback on the glibc embargo for
CVE-2023-6246). They immediately acknowledged receipt of our email.

2024-01-30: Coordinated Release Date (18:00 UTC).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2024-07597a0fb3
2024-02-01 01:23:37.270537
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 38
Version : 2.37
Release : 18.fc38
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fix for CVE-2023-6246, CVE-2023-6779, and CVE-2023-6780.
CVE-2023-6246: \_\_vsyslog\_internal did not handle a case where printing a
SYSLOG\_HEADER containing a long program name failed to update the required
buffer size, leading to the allocation and overflow of a too-small buffer on the
heap. CVE-2023-6779: \_\_vsyslog\_internal used the return value of
snprintf/vsnprintf to calculate buffer sizes for memory allocation. If these
functions (for any reason) failed and returned -1, the resulting buffer would be
too small to hold output. CVE-2023-6780: \_\_vsyslog\_internal calculated a buffer
size by adding two integers, but did not first check if the addition would
overflow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c1)  Florian Weimer    2023-11-15 12:40:39 UTC  ``` Isn't this a duplicate of [bug 2123394](show_bug.cgi?id=2123394 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-39046 glibc: a crafted input may allow information disclosure")?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c2)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-11-17 18:28:59 UTC  ``` Hi @fweimer, it's not the same issue.

Summary
========================================================================

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's
__vsyslog_internal() function, which is called by both syslog() and
vsyslog(). This vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.37 (in August
2022) by the following commit:

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=52a5be0df411ef3ff45c10c7c308cb92993d15b1>

and was also backported to glibc 2.36 because this commit was a fix for
another, minor vulnerability in __vsyslog_internal() (CVE-2022-39046, an
"uninitialized memory [read] from the heap"):

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29536>

For example, we confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10,
and Fedora 37 to 39 are vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Furthermore,
we successfully exploited an up-to-date, default installation of Fedora
38 (on amd64): a Local Privilege Escalation, from any unprivileged user
to full root. Other distributions are probably also exploitable.

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability cannot be triggered
remotely in any likely scenario (because it requires an argv[0], or an
openlog() ident argument, longer than 1024 bytes to be triggered).

Last-minute note: in December 1997 Solar Designer published information
about a very similar vulnerability in the vsyslog() of the old Linux
libc (<https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.5.4.38.vsyslog.html>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

In the glibc, both syslog() and vsyslog() call the vulnerable function
__vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
122 __vsyslog_internal (int pri, const char *fmt, va_list ap,
123                     unsigned int mode_flags)
124 {
125   /* Try to use a static buffer as an optimization.  */
126   char bufs[1024];
127   char *buf = NULL;
128   size_t bufsize = 0;
...
171 #define SYSLOG_HEADER(__pri, __timestamp, __msgoff, pid) \
172   "<%d>%s%n%s%s%.0d%s: ",                                \
173   __pri, __timestamp, __msgoff,                          \
174   LogTag == NULL ? __progname : LogTag,                  \
175   "[" + (pid == 0), pid, "]" + (pid == 0)
...
182     l = __snprintf (bufs, sizeof bufs,
183                     SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
187   if (0 <= l && l < sizeof bufs)
188     {
...
202     }
203
204   if (buf == NULL)
205     {
206       buf = malloc ((bufsize + 1) * sizeof (char));
...
213             __snprintf (buf, l + 1,
214                         SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
221           __vsnprintf_internal (buf + l, bufsize - l + 1, fmt, apc,
222                                 mode_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 182-183, SYSLOG_HEADER() includes __progname (the basename()
  of argv[0]) if LogTag is NULL (e.g., if openlog() was not called, or
  called with a NULL ident argument);

- because a local attacker fully controls argv[0] and hence __progname
  (even when executing a SUID-root program such as su), at line 187 l
  (the return value of __snprintf()) can be larger than sizeof bufs
  (1024), in which case the code block at lines 188-202 is skipped;

- consequently, at line 203 buf is still NULL and bufsize is still 0,
  and at line 206 a very small 1-byte buf is malloc()ated (because
  bufsize is 0);

- at lines 213-214 this small buf is overflowed with the attacker-
  controlled __progname (because l is larger than 1024), and at lines
  221-222 this small buf is further overflowed (because bufsize - l + 1
  is 0 - l + 1, a very large size_t).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

$ (exec -a "`printf '%0128000x' 1`" /usr/bin/su < /dev/null)
Password: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

We decided to exploit this vulnerability through su (the most common
SUID-root program) on Fedora 38. To authenticate a user, su calls the
PAM library, and if the password provided by the user is incorrect, then
PAM calls the glibc's syslog() function without calling openlog() first,
thus allowing us to trigger the buffer overflow in __vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
782                         pam_syslog(pamh, LOG_NOTICE,
783                                  "authentication failure; "
784                                  "logname=%s uid=%d euid=%d "
785                                  "tty=%s ruser=%s rhost=%s "
786                                  "%s%s",
787                                  new->name, new->uid, new->euid,
788                                  tty ? (const char *)tty : "",
789                                  ruser ? (const char *)ruser : "",
790                                  rhost ? (const char *)rhost : "",
791                                  (new->user && new->user[0] != '\0')
792                                   ? " user=" : "",
793                                  new->user
794                         );
------------------------------------------------------------------------
107 pam_syslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
108             const char *fmt, ...)
109 {
...
113   pam_vsyslog (pamh, priority, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 73 pam_vsyslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
 74              const char *fmt, va_list args)
 75 {
 ..
 81       if (asprintf (&msgbuf1, "%s(%s:%s):", pamh->mod_name,
 82                     pamh->service_name?pamh->service_name:"<unknown>",
 83                     _pam_choice2str (pamh->choice)) < 0)
 ..
 91   if (vasprintf (&msgbuf2, fmt, args) < 0)
 ..
 99   syslog (LOG_AUTHPRIV|priority, "%s %s",
100           (msgbuf1 ? msgbuf1 : _PAM_SYSTEM_LOG_PREFIX), msgbuf2);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what should we overwrite in the heap to successfully exploit this
buffer overflow? Initially, because su calls setlocale(LC_ALL, ""); at
the very beginning of its su_main() function, we tried to reuse the key
idea from our Baron Samedit exploits (CVE-2021-3156 in Sudo): we wrote a
rudimentary fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and random locale
environment variables and automatically inspect the resulting crashes in
gdb. Unfortunately this fuzzer failed to produce interesting results: we
only obtained a handful of unique crashes, and they did not look very
promising.

However, we did not investigate the reasons for this failure, because
while browsing through su's source code we noticed that su_main() calls
env_whitelist_from_string() to parse the argument of the -w command-line
option:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1118                 case 'w':
1119                         env_whitelist_from_string(su, optarg);
1120                         break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 692 static int env_whitelist_from_string(struct su_context *su, const char *str)
 693 {
 694         char **all = strv_split(str, ",");
 ...
 703         STRV_FOREACH(one, all)
 704                 env_whitelist_add(su, *one);
 705         strv_free(all);
 706         return 0;
 707 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 662 static int env_whitelist_add(struct su_context *su, const char *name)
 663 {
 664         const char *env = getenv(name);
 665
 666         if (!env)
 667                 return 1;
 668         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_names, name))
 669                 err_oom();
 670         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_vals, env))
 671                 err_oom();
 672         return 0;
 673 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conveniently, env_whitelist_from_string() allows us (attackers) to
malloc()ate and free() an arbitrary number of arbitrary strings at the
very beginning of su's execution: an almost perfect heap feng shui. We
therefore rewrote our fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and a
random whitelist option (instead of random locale environment variables)
and immediately observed numerous unique crashes; among these, three in
particular caught our attention.

========================================================================
1/ Corruption of PAM structures
========================================================================

Surprisingly, our fuzzer directly overwrote two PAM function pointers
(in struct pam_data and struct handler):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

rax            0x4545454545454545  4991471925827290437
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this sounds exciting at first (a call to 0x4141414141414141!)
we decided to not pursue this avenue of exploitation:

- we cannot overwrite such a function pointer with null bytes (because
  we overflow __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer with a null-terminated
  string), but userland addresses contain at least two null bytes;

- we could try to partially overwrite such a function pointer, but we do
  not control the end of the string that overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s
  buffer (the end of the aforementioned pam_syslog() format string), and
  such an uncontrolled, partially overwritten function pointer is very
  unlikely to miraculously point to a useful ROP gadget.

========================================================================
2/ Corruption of heap metadata
========================================================================

Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep -A1 __libc_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
...
chunk_main_arena (bck->bk)
chunk_main_arena (fwd)
corrupted double-linked list
corrupted double-linked list (not small)
corrupted size vs. prev_size
corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins
double free or corruption (out)
free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
free(): invalid next size (fast)
free(): invalid pointer
free(): invalid size
malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
malloc(): corrupted top size
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:

- we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
  pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
  valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;

- in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
  address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
  an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
  randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.

========================================================================
3/ Corruption of nss structures
========================================================================

Our fuzzer also produced two crashes that immediately caught our
attention because they are directly related to one of the techniques
that we used to exploit Baron Samedit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__GI___nss_lookup (ni=ni@...ry=0x7ffe876a05e8, fct_name=fct_name@...ry=0x7fbba214e4e7 "getpwnam_r", fct2_name=fct2_name@...ry=0x0, fctp=fctp@...ry=0x7ffe876a05f0) at nsswitch.c:67

rdi            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in the "2/ struct service_user overwrite" subsection of our
Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
struct nss_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
constructed ("libnss_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
su is a SUID-root program):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 module_load (struct nss_module *module)
171 {
...
180     if (__asprintf (&shlib_name, "libnss_%s.so%s",
181                     module->name, __nss_shlib_revision) < 0)
...
187     handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the __progname part (which we control) of the string that
overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
__progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam_syslog() format
string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
For example, if:

- our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);

- our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);

- the argv[0] (and hence __progname) that we use to execute su is a long
  string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);

then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss_module
with a string of the form:

  "AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root"

Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
current working directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"

and also create the following shared library (in our current working
directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=  user=root.so.2"

then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).

Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

Timeline
========================================================================

2023-11-07: We sent a preliminary draft of our advisory to Red Hat
Product Security.

2023-11-15: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email.

2023-11-16: Red Hat Product Security asked us if we could share our
exploit with them.

2023-11-17: We sent our exploit to Red Hat Product Security.

2023-11-21: Red Hat Product Security confirmed that our exploit worked,
and assigned CVE-2023-6246 to this heap-based buffer overflow in
__vsyslog_internal().

2023-12-05: Red Hat Product Security sent us a patch for CVE-2023-6246
(written by the glibc developers), and asked us for our feedback.

2023-12-07: While reviewing this patch, we discovered two more minor
vulnerabilities in the same function (an off-by-one buffer overflow and
an integer overflow). We immediately sent an analysis, proof of concept,
and patch proposal to Red Hat Product Security, and suggested that we
directly involve the glibc security team.

2023-12-08: Red Hat Product Security acknowledged receipt of our email,
and agreed that we should directly involve the glibc security team. We
contacted them on the same day, and they immediately replied with very
constructive comments.

2023-12-11: The glibc security team suggested that we postpone the
coordinated disclosure of all three vulnerabilities until January 2024
(because of the upcoming holiday season). We agreed.

2023-12-13: Red Hat Product Security assigned CVE-2023-6779 to the

CVE-2023-6246: Heap-based buffer overflow in the glibc's syslog()
========================================================================

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's
\_\_vsyslog\_internal() function, which is called by both syslog() and
vsyslog(). This vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.37 (in August
2022) by the following commit:
https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=52a5be0df411ef3ff45c10c7c308cb92993d15b1
and was also backported to glibc 2.36 because this commit was a fix for
another, minor vulnerability in \_\_vsyslog\_internal() (CVE-2022-39046, an
"uninitialized memory [read] from the heap"):
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=29536
For example, we confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10,
and Fedora 37 to 39 are vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Furthermore,
we successfully exploited an up-to-date, default installation of Fedora
38 (on amd64): a Local Privilege Escalation, from any unprivileged user
to full root. Other distributions are probably also exploitable.
To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability cannot be triggered
remotely in any likely scenario (because it requires an argv[0], or an
openlog() ident argument, longer than 1024 bytes to be triggered).
Last-minute note: in December 1997 Solar Designer published information
about a very similar vulnerability in the vsyslog() of the old Linux
libc (https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.5.4.38.vsyslog.html).
========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================
In the glibc, both syslog() and vsyslog() call the vulnerable function
\_\_vsyslog\_internal():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
122 \_\_vsyslog\_internal (int pri, const char \*fmt, va\_list ap,
123 unsigned int mode\_flags)
124 {
125 /\* Try to use a static buffer as an optimization. \*/
126 char bufs[1024];
127 char \*buf = NULL;
128 size\_t bufsize = 0;
...
171 #define SYSLOG\_HEADER(\_\_pri, \_\_timestamp, \_\_msgoff, pid) \
172 "<%d>%s%n%s%s%.0d%s: ", \
173 \_\_pri, \_\_timestamp, \_\_msgoff, \
174 LogTag == NULL ? \_\_progname : LogTag, \
175 "[" + (pid == 0), pid, "]" + (pid == 0)
...
182 l = \_\_snprintf (bufs, sizeof bufs,
183 SYSLOG\_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
187 if (0 <= l && l < sizeof bufs)
188 {
...
202 }
203
204 if (buf == NULL)
205 {
206 buf = malloc ((bufsize + 1) \* sizeof (char));
...
213 \_\_snprintf (buf, l + 1,
214 SYSLOG\_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
221 \_\_vsnprintf\_internal (buf + l, bufsize - l + 1, fmt, apc,
222 mode\_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- at lines 182-183, SYSLOG\_HEADER() includes \_\_progname (the basename()
of argv[0]) if LogTag is NULL (e.g., if openlog() was not called, or
called with a NULL ident argument);
- because a local attacker fully controls argv[0] and hence \_\_progname
(even when executing a SUID-root program such as su), at line 187 l
(the return value of \_\_snprintf()) can be larger than sizeof bufs
(1024), in which case the code block at lines 188-202 is skipped;
- consequently, at line 203 buf is still NULL and bufsize is still 0,
and at line 206 a very small 1-byte buf is malloc()ated (because
bufsize is 0);
- at lines 213-214 this small buf is overflowed with the attacker-
controlled \_\_progname (because l is larger than 1024), and at lines
221-222 this small buf is further overflowed (because bufsize - l + 1
is 0 - l + 1, a very large size\_t).
========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================
$ (exec -a "`printf '%0128000x' 1`" /usr/bin/su < /dev/null)
Password: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================
We decided to exploit this vulnerability through su (the most common
SUID-root program) on Fedora 38. To authenticate a user, su calls the
PAM library, and if the password provided by the user is incorrect, then
PAM calls the glibc's syslog() function without calling openlog() first,
thus allowing us to trigger the buffer overflow in \_\_vsyslog\_internal():
------------------------------------------------------------------------
782 pam\_syslog(pamh, LOG\_NOTICE,
783 "authentication failure; "
784 "logname=%s uid=%d euid=%d "
785 "tty=%s ruser=%s rhost=%s "
786 "%s%s",
787 new->name, new->uid, new->euid,
788 tty ? (const char \*)tty : "",
789 ruser ? (const char \*)ruser : "",
790 rhost ? (const char \*)rhost : "",
791 (new->user && new->user[0] != '\0')
792 ? " user=" : "",
793 new->user
794 );
------------------------------------------------------------------------
107 pam\_syslog (const pam\_handle\_t \*pamh, int priority,
108 const char \*fmt, ...)
109 {
...
113 pam\_vsyslog (pamh, priority, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
73 pam\_vsyslog (const pam\_handle\_t \*pamh, int priority,
74 const char \*fmt, va\_list args)
75 {
..
81 if (asprintf (&msgbuf1, "%s(%s:%s):", pamh->mod\_name,
82 pamh->service\_name?pamh->service\_name:"",
83 \_pam\_choice2str (pamh->choice)) < 0)
..
91 if (vasprintf (&msgbuf2, fmt, args) < 0)
..
99 syslog (LOG\_AUTHPRIV|priority, "%s %s",
100 (msgbuf1 ? msgbuf1 : \_PAM\_SYSTEM\_LOG\_PREFIX), msgbuf2);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
But what should we overwrite in the heap to successfully exploit this
buffer overflow? Initially, because su calls setlocale(LC\_ALL, ""); at
the very beginning of its su\_main() function, we tried to reuse the key
idea from our Baron Samedit exploits (CVE-2021-3156 in Sudo): we wrote a
rudimentary fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and random locale
environment variables and automatically inspect the resulting crashes in
gdb. Unfortunately this fuzzer failed to produce interesting results: we
only obtained a handful of unique crashes, and they did not look very
promising.
However, we did not investigate the reasons for this failure, because
while browsing through su's source code we noticed that su\_main() calls
env\_whitelist\_from\_string() to parse the argument of the -w command-line
option:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1118 case 'w':
1119 env\_whitelist\_from\_string(su, optarg);
1120 break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
692 static int env\_whitelist\_from\_string(struct su\_context \*su, const char \*str)
693 {
694 char \*\*all = strv\_split(str, ",");
...
703 STRV\_FOREACH(one, all)
704 env\_whitelist\_add(su, \*one);
705 strv\_free(all);
706 return 0;
707 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
662 static int env\_whitelist\_add(struct su\_context \*su, const char \*name)
663 {
664 const char \*env = getenv(name);
665
666 if (!env)
667 return 1;
668 if (strv\_extend(&su->env\_whitelist\_names, name))
669 err\_oom();
670 if (strv\_extend(&su->env\_whitelist\_vals, env))
671 err\_oom();
672 return 0;
673 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conveniently, env\_whitelist\_from\_string() allows us (attackers) to
malloc()ate and free() an arbitrary number of arbitrary strings at the
very beginning of su's execution: an almost perfect heap feng shui. We
therefore rewrote our fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and a
random whitelist option (instead of random locale environment variables)
and immediately observed numerous unique crashes; among these, three in
particular caught our attention.
========================================================================
1/ Corruption of PAM structures
========================================================================
Surprisingly, our fuzzer directly overwrote two PAM function pointers
(in struct pam\_data and struct handler):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fa7d3b0e3ac in \_pam\_free\_data (status=7, pamh=0x56211242ec10) at /usr/src/debug/pam-1.5.2-16.fc38.x86\_64/libpam/pam\_data.c:161

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007f928b5e5781 in \_pam\_dispatch\_aux (use\_cached\_chain=, resumed=, h=0x55f2e374aae0, flags=0, pamh=0x55f2e374aae0) at /usr/src/debug/pam-1.5.2-16.fc38.x86\_64/libpam/pam\_dispatch.c:110

rax 0x4545454545454545 4991471925827290437
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although this sounds exciting at first (a call to 0x4141414141414141!)
we decided to not pursue this avenue of exploitation:
- we cannot overwrite such a function pointer with null bytes (because
we overflow \_\_vsyslog\_internal()'s buffer with a null-terminated
string), but userland addresses contain at least two null bytes;
- we could try to partially overwrite such a function pointer, but we do
not control the end of the string that overflows \_\_vsyslog\_internal()'s
buffer (the end of the aforementioned pam\_syslog() format string), and
such an uncontrolled, partially overwritten function pointer is very
unlikely to miraculously point to a useful ROP gadget.
========================================================================
2/ Corruption of heap metadata
========================================================================
Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep -A1 \_\_libc\_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
...
chunk\_main\_arena (bck->bk)
chunk\_main\_arena (fwd)
corrupted double-linked list
corrupted double-linked list (not small)
corrupted size vs. prev\_size
corrupted size vs. prev\_size in fastbins
double free or corruption (out)
free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
free(): invalid next size (fast)
free(): invalid pointer
free(): invalid size
malloc\_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
malloc(): corrupted top size
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
munmap\_chunk(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:
- we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;
- in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.
========================================================================
3/ Corruption of nss structures
========================================================================
Our fuzzer also produced two crashes that immediately caught our
attention because they are directly related to one of the techniques
that we used to exploit Baron Samedit:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
\_\_GI\_\_\_nss\_lookup (ni=ni@entry=0x7ffe876a05e8, fct\_name=fct\_name@entry=0x7fbba214e4e7 "getpwnam\_r", fct2\_name=fct2\_name@entry=0x0, fctp=fctp@entry=0x7ffe876a05f0) at nsswitch.c:67

...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
\_\_nss\_module\_get\_function (module=0x4141414141414141, name=name@entry=0x7f0aed9034e7 "getpwnam\_r") at nss\_module.c:328
328 if (!\_\_nss\_module\_load (module))
...
=> 0x7f0aed8a34b7 <\_\_nss\_module\_get\_function+39>: mov (%rdi),%eax
rdi 0x4141414141414141 4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As discussed in the "2/ struct service\_user overwrite" subsection of our
Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
struct nss\_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
constructed ("libnss\_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
su is a SUID-root program):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 module\_load (struct nss\_module \*module)
171 {
...
180 if (\_\_asprintf (&shlib\_name, "libnss\_%s.so%s",
181 module->name, \_\_nss\_shlib\_revision) < 0)
...
187 handle = \_\_libc\_dlopen (shlib\_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the \_\_progname part (which we control) of the string that
overflows \_\_vsyslog\_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
\_\_progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam\_syslog() format
string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
For example, if:
- our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);
- our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);
- the argv[0] (and hence \_\_progname) that we use to execute su is a long
string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);
then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss\_module
with a string of the form:
"AAAAAAAAAA: pam\_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost= user=root"
Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
current working directory):
"libnss\_AAAAAAAAAA: pam\_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
"libnss\_AAAAAAAAAA: pam\_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
"libnss\_AAAAAAAAAA: pam\_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"
and also create the following shared library (in our current working
directory):
"libnss\_AAAAAAAAAA: pam\_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost= user=root.so.2"
then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).
Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

We discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C Library's
__vsyslog_internal() function, which is called by both syslog() and
vsyslog(). This vulnerability was introduced in glibc 2.37 (in August
2022) by the following commit:

  <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=52a5be0df411ef3ff45c10c7c308cb92993d15b1>

and was also backported to glibc 2.36 because this commit was a fix for
another, minor vulnerability in __vsyslog_internal() (CVE-2022-39046, an
"uninitialized memory [read] from the heap"):

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29536>

For example, we confirmed that Debian 12 and 13, Ubuntu 23.04 and 23.10,
and Fedora 37 to 39 are vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Furthermore,
we successfully exploited an up-to-date, default installation of Fedora
38 (on amd64): a Local Privilege Escalation, from any unprivileged user
to full root. Other distributions are probably also exploitable.

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability cannot be triggered
remotely in any likely scenario (because it requires an argv[0], or an
openlog() ident argument, longer than 1024 bytes to be triggered).

Last-minute note: in December 1997 Solar Designer published information
about a very similar vulnerability in the vsyslog() of the old Linux
libc (<https://insecure.org/sploits/linux.libc.5.4.38.vsyslog.html>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

In the glibc, both syslog() and vsyslog() call the vulnerable function
__vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
122 __vsyslog_internal (int pri, const char *fmt, va_list ap,
123                     unsigned int mode_flags)
124 {
125   /* Try to use a static buffer as an optimization.  */
126   char bufs[1024];
127   char *buf = NULL;
128   size_t bufsize = 0;
...
171 #define SYSLOG_HEADER(__pri, __timestamp, __msgoff, pid) \
172   "<%d>%s%n%s%s%.0d%s: ",                                \
173   __pri, __timestamp, __msgoff,                          \
174   LogTag == NULL ? __progname : LogTag,                  \
175   "[" + (pid == 0), pid, "]" + (pid == 0)
...
182     l = __snprintf (bufs, sizeof bufs,
183                     SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
187   if (0 <= l && l < sizeof bufs)
188     {
...
202     }
203
204   if (buf == NULL)
205     {
206       buf = malloc ((bufsize + 1) * sizeof (char));
...
213             __snprintf (buf, l + 1,
214                         SYSLOG_HEADER (pri, timestamp, &msgoff, pid));
...
221           __vsnprintf_internal (buf + l, bufsize - l + 1, fmt, apc,
222                                 mode_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at lines 182-183, SYSLOG_HEADER() includes __progname (the basename()
  of argv[0]) if LogTag is NULL (e.g., if openlog() was not called, or
  called with a NULL ident argument);

- because a local attacker fully controls argv[0] and hence __progname
  (even when executing a SUID-root program such as su), at line 187 l
  (the return value of __snprintf()) can be larger than sizeof bufs
  (1024), in which case the code block at lines 188-202 is skipped;

- consequently, at line 203 buf is still NULL and bufsize is still 0,
  and at line 206 a very small 1-byte buf is malloc()ated (because
  bufsize is 0);

- at lines 213-214 this small buf is overflowed with the attacker-
  controlled __progname (because l is larger than 1024), and at lines
  221-222 this small buf is further overflowed (because bufsize - l + 1
  is 0 - l + 1, a very large size_t).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

$ (exec -a "`printf '%0128000x' 1`" /usr/bin/su < /dev/null)
Password: Segmentation fault (core dumped)

========================================================================
Exploitation
========================================================================

We decided to exploit this vulnerability through su (the most common
SUID-root program) on Fedora 38. To authenticate a user, su calls the
PAM library, and if the password provided by the user is incorrect, then
PAM calls the glibc's syslog() function without calling openlog() first,
thus allowing us to trigger the buffer overflow in __vsyslog_internal():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
782                         pam_syslog(pamh, LOG_NOTICE,
783                                  "authentication failure; "
784                                  "logname=%s uid=%d euid=%d "
785                                  "tty=%s ruser=%s rhost=%s "
786                                  "%s%s",
787                                  new->name, new->uid, new->euid,
788                                  tty ? (const char *)tty : "",
789                                  ruser ? (const char *)ruser : "",
790                                  rhost ? (const char *)rhost : "",
791                                  (new->user && new->user[0] != '\0')
792                                   ? " user=" : "",
793                                  new->user
794                         );
------------------------------------------------------------------------
107 pam_syslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
108             const char *fmt, ...)
109 {
...
113   pam_vsyslog (pamh, priority, fmt, args);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 73 pam_vsyslog (const pam_handle_t *pamh, int priority,
 74              const char *fmt, va_list args)
 75 {
 ..
 81       if (asprintf (&msgbuf1, "%s(%s:%s):", pamh->mod_name,
 82                     pamh->service_name?pamh->service_name:"<unknown>",
 83                     _pam_choice2str (pamh->choice)) < 0)
 ..
 91   if (vasprintf (&msgbuf2, fmt, args) < 0)
 ..
 99   syslog (LOG_AUTHPRIV|priority, "%s %s",
100           (msgbuf1 ? msgbuf1 : _PAM_SYSTEM_LOG_PREFIX), msgbuf2);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what should we overwrite in the heap to successfully exploit this
buffer overflow? Initially, because su calls setlocale(LC_ALL, ""); at
the very beginning of its su_main() function, we tried to reuse the key
idea from our Baron Samedit exploits (CVE-2021-3156 in Sudo): we wrote a
rudimentary fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and random locale
environment variables and automatically inspect the resulting crashes in
gdb. Unfortunately this fuzzer failed to produce interesting results: we
only obtained a handful of unique crashes, and they did not look very
promising.

However, we did not investigate the reasons for this failure, because
while browsing through su's source code we noticed that su_main() calls
env_whitelist_from_string() to parse the argument of the -w command-line
option:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1118                 case 'w':
1119                         env_whitelist_from_string(su, optarg);
1120                         break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 692 static int env_whitelist_from_string(struct su_context *su, const char *str)
 693 {
 694         char **all = strv_split(str, ",");
 ...
 703         STRV_FOREACH(one, all)
 704                 env_whitelist_add(su, *one);
 705         strv_free(all);
 706         return 0;
 707 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 662 static int env_whitelist_add(struct su_context *su, const char *name)
 663 {
 664         const char *env = getenv(name);
 665
 666         if (!env)
 667                 return 1;
 668         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_names, name))
 669                 err_oom();
 670         if (strv_extend(&su->env_whitelist_vals, env))
 671                 err_oom();
 672         return 0;
 673 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conveniently, env_whitelist_from_string() allows us (attackers) to
malloc()ate and free() an arbitrary number of arbitrary strings at the
very beginning of su's execution: an almost perfect heap feng shui. We
therefore rewrote our fuzzer to execute su with a random argv[0] and a
random whitelist option (instead of random locale environment variables)
and immediately observed numerous unique crashes; among these, three in
particular caught our attention.

========================================================================
1/ Corruption of PAM structures
========================================================================

Surprisingly, our fuzzer directly overwrote two PAM function pointers
(in struct pam_data and struct handler):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007fa7d3b0e3ac in _pam_free_data (status=7, pamh=0x56211242ec10) at

rax            0x4545454545454545  4991471925827290437
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this sounds exciting at first (a call to 0x4141414141414141!)
we decided to not pursue this avenue of exploitation:

- we cannot overwrite such a function pointer with null bytes (because
  we overflow __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer with a null-terminated
  string), but userland addresses contain at least two null bytes;

- we could try to partially overwrite such a function pointer, but we do
  not control the end of the string that overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s
  buffer (the end of the aforementioned pam_syslog() format string), and
  such an uncontrolled, partially overwritten function pointer is very
  unlikely to miraculously point to a useful ROP gadget.

========================================================================
2/ Corruption of heap metadata
========================================================================

Unsurprisingly, our fuzzer also overwrote various pieces of heap
metadata (chunk headers managed internally by the glibc's malloc), and
therefore triggered all kinds of assertion failures and security checks:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ grep -A1 __libc_message fuzzer.out | cut -d'"' -f2 | sort -u
...
chunk_main_arena (bck->bk)
chunk_main_arena (fwd)
corrupted double-linked list
corrupted double-linked list (not small)
corrupted size vs. prev_size
corrupted size vs. prev_size in fastbins
double free or corruption (out)
free(): corrupted unsorted chunks
free(): invalid next size (fast)
free(): invalid pointer
free(): invalid size
malloc_consolidate(): invalid chunk size
malloc(): corrupted top size
malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
malloc(): smallbin double linked list corrupted
malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected
malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although some of these corruptions might be exploitable, we decided to
not pursue this avenue of exploitation either:

- we cannot overwrite a chunk header with a size field and an fd or bk
  pointer that are both valid (they must both contain null bytes to be
  valid), which severely limits our exploitation options;

- in any case, we would probably need a specific heap, mmap, or stack
  address to exploit such a corruption, but we do not have the luxury of
  an information leak, and all these addresses are too heavily
  randomized by ASLR to be brute forced.

========================================================================
3/ Corruption of nss structures
========================================================================

Our fuzzer also produced two crashes that immediately caught our
attention because they are directly related to one of the techniques
that we used to exploit Baron Samedit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thread 2.1 "su" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
__GI___nss_lookup (ni=ni@entry=0x7ffe876a05e8, fct_name=fct_name@entry=0x7fbba214e4e7 "getpwnam_r",

rdi            0x4141414141414141  4702111234474983745
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in the "2/ struct service_user overwrite" subsection of our
Baron Samedit advisory, if we overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based
struct nss_module with a string of characters that contains a slash (for
example "A/B/C"), then at lines 180-181 the name of a shared library is
constructed ("libnss_A/B/C.so.2"), and at line 187 this shared library
is loaded from our current working directory (because its name contains
a slash, but does not start with a slash) and executed as root (because
su is a SUID-root program):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
170 module_load (struct nss_module *module)
171 {
...
180     if (__asprintf (&shlib_name, "libnss_%s.so%s",
181                     module->name, __nss_shlib_revision) < 0)
...
187     handle = __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the __progname part (which we control) of the string that
overflows __vsyslog_internal()'s buffer cannot contain a slash (because
__progname is the basename() of argv[0]). Luckily, however, the part of
the overflowing string that we do not control (the pam_syslog() format
string) includes the absolute path of our tty, which contains a slash.
For example, if:

- our tty is /dev/pts/23 (we use forkpty() in our exploit);

- our unprivileged local user is nobody (uid 65534);

- the argv[0] (and hence __progname) that we use to execute su is a long
  string of 'A' characters (longer than 1024);

then we can overwrite the name[] field of a heap-based struct nss_module
with a string of the form:

  "AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody rhost=
 user=root"

Consequently, if we first create the following three directories (in our
current working directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty="
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev"
  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts"

and also create the following shared library (in our current working
directory):

  "libnss_AAAAAAAAAA: pam_unix(su:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=65534 euid=0 tty=/dev/pts/23 ruser=nobody
rhost=  user=root.so.2"

then this shared library will eventually be loaded and executed with
full root privileges. In our tests, it takes a few 10,000s of tries to
successfully brute force the exploit parameters (the length of argv[0],
and the whitelist option and its associated environment variables).

Note: this exploit could certainly be made much more efficient; in
theory, it could even be a one-shot exploit, because we do not need to
brute force the ASLR, only the heap layout.

The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

Update Information:

Security fix for CVE-2023-6246, CVE-2023-6779, and CVE-2023-6780.
CVE-2023-6246: \_\_vsyslog\_internal did not handle a case where printing a
SYSLOG\_HEADER containing a long program name failed to update the required
buffer size, leading to the allocation and overflow of a too-small buffer on the
heap. CVE-2023-6779: \_\_vsyslog\_internal used the return value of
snprintf/vsnprintf to calculate buffer sizes for memory allocation. If these
functions (for any reason) failed and returned -1, the resulting buffer would be
too small to hold output. CVE-2023-6780: \_\_vsyslog\_internal calculated a buffer
size by adding two integers, but did not first check if the addition would
overflow.
