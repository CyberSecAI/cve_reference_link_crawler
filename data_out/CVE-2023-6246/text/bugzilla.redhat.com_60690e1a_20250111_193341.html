| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2023-11-10 13:17:32 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c1)  Florian Weimer    2023-11-15 12:40:39 UTC  ``` Isn't this a duplicate of [bug 2123394](show_bug.cgi?id=2123394 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-39046 glibc: a crafted input may allow information disclosure")?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c2)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2023-11-17 18:28:59 UTC  ``` Hi @fweimer, it's not the same issue. The [comment#0](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c0) will be updated to have more details as soon as possible.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2249053#c13)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2024-01-30 18:46:19 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2261987](show_bug.cgi?id=2261987 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2023-6246 glibc: heap-based buffer overflow in __vsyslog_internal() [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
