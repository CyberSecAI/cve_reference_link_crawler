- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A maliciously formed request allowed users to view chat messages they should not have access to. The vulnerability is related to a lack of proper channel access checks when looking up chat messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284). The application failed to properly check if a user has the required privileges to view messages in a specific chat channel.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could view chat messages that they are not authorized to see, leading to a breach of confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges, indicating that they need to be an authenticated user, but do not need high level privileges. No user interaction is required.
