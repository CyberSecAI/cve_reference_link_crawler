- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A TLS 1.3 server implementation in Mbed TLS fails to handle ClientHello messages without extensions, leading to a denial-of-service condition where the server stops accepting any new connections even from clients sending valid ClientHello messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The server does not correctly handle a ClientHello message without extensions, causing it to enter a state where it rejects all subsequent connection attempts, even those with valid handshakes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The server becomes unable to establish new connections and denies services to legitimate users.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send a TLS 1.3 ClientHello without extensions, causing the server to reject all subsequent connection attempts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server, specifically crafting a ClientHello message that does not include extensions.
