{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Linked Variation for WooCommerce plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user with sufficient privileges, would execute an action the attacker desires.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves."
