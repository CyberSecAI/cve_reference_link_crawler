Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a double free vulnerability in the SELinux subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `cond_list_destroy()` function, which is responsible for freeing the memory allocated for a condition list, is called multiple times on error paths within `cond_read_list()` and `duplicate_policydb_cond_list()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double free. The `cond_list_destroy()` function is being called multiple times for the same memory region on error paths, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the memory is freed the second time and dereferenced.
- **Lack of Proper Resource Management:** The code fails to properly reset the `cond_list` pointer and `cond_list_len` after freeing the memory in the `cond_list_destroy` function itself. This allows subsequent calls to `cond_list_destroy` to operate on already freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The double free vulnerability leads to a NULL pointer dereference when `cond_node_destroy` is called, resulting in a kernel crash or denial-of-service.
- **Potential for Memory Corruption:** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, double free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited for arbitrary memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by causing an error condition within `cond_read_list()` or `duplicate_policydb_cond_list()`. This could possibly be achieved by providing malformed input or through other system interactions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the SELinux subsystem to trigger the vulnerable code paths. The specific methods for doing so may vary.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
The provided content gives more detail than a simple CVE description by showing the exact code changes that fix the vulnerability. The commits show the double free vulnerability occurs due to the `cond_list_destroy` function being called multiple times, and a missing reset of `cond_list` pointer and `cond_list_len`, and also the fix for the vulnerability that adds the reset in the destroy function to avoid double free.
