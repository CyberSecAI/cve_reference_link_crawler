  "CVE-2020-36182": {
    "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.8 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS.",
    "root_cause": "Mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of serialization gadgets",
      "Mishandling of polymorphic typing"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted JSON content to be deserialized.",
        "Exploiting polymorphic type handling by providing a gadget class instead of the expected class."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted JSON data to a system using a vulnerable version of jackson-databind, and the system has to use polymorphic type handling.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to the `org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS` class. This issue affects systems that use polymorphic typing with Jackson and have this specific class available in the classpath.  This specific vulnerability is one of several related to the use of unsafe classes as gadgets that are blocked in later Jackson versions.  Affected versions include Jackson 2.x before 2.9.10.8, Jackson 2.6.7.5 and prior."
