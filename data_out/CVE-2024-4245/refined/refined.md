Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formQosManageDouble_user` function within the Tenda i21 firmware. The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `sprintf` function with an attacker-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into the `mib_prefix_wl2g` buffer. The size of this buffer is limited. The attacker-controlled `ssidIndex` parameter is used without proper bounds checking which allows writing past the allocated memory.
- **Unsanitized input:** The `ssidIndex` parameter from a POST request is directly used in the `sprintf` function. There is no sanitization or validation of the input provided by user which leads to overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** The stack overflow can potentially overwrite the return address and other important data on the stack which would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of service:** Crashing the device due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the device with a malicious `ssidIndex` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda i21 device. This typically means being on the same network as the device or having access through another means like port forwarding.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific endpoint that handles the `formQosManageDouble_user` function.
- **Ability to craft the payload:** The attacker needs to construct the malicious `ssidIndex` value to cause the overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The affected firmware version is i21 V1.0.0.14(4656).
- The vulnerable code is in the `formQosManageDouble_user` function.
- The overflow happens in the line `sprintf(mib_prefix_wl2g, "wl2g.ssid%s.", index);` where `index` contains the attacker controlled `ssidIndex` value.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the use of a POST request with the "ssidIndex" parameter to trigger the vulnerability.
