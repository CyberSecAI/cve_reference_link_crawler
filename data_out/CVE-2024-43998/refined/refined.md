- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper access control mechanisms in the WordPress Blogpoet theme.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that are normally restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access control checks within the theme, potentially through direct interaction with the vulnerable functions or components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
