# Limit pages/exec.php script to PHP files

Critical

[Molkobain](/Molkobain)
published
GHSA-g652-q7cc-7hfc
Apr 15, 2024

## Package

iTop
(SourceForge)

## Affected versions

2.7.9, 3.0.3, 3.1.0

## Patched versions

2.7.10, 3.0.4, 3.1.1, 3.2.0

## Description

### Impact

Files from the `env-production` folder can be retrieved even though they should have restricted access.

Hopefully, there is no sensitive files stored in that folder natively, but there could be from a third-party module.

### Patches

The `pages/exec.php` script has been fixed to limit execution of PHP files only. Other file types won't be retrieved and exposed.

### Workarounds

No workaround, any file within `env-production` folder can be retrieved. But again, there is no sensitive data in that folder natively.

### References

* Combodo N°6989

Huge thanks to Ahmad Shauqi from NetbyteSEC SDN BHD for reporting this.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID
