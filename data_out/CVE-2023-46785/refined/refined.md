Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2023-46785:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2023-46785 and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Online Matrimonial Project v1.0".

**2. Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation for the `id` parameter in the `partner_preference.php` resource. The application directly uses the unsanitized input from the GET request in an SQL query.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi). The application does not sanitize or validate user-provided data before using it in an SQL query.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. This includes user information, preferences, or any other data stored within the database.
   - **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain operating system level access and compromise the whole server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection and can be accessed remotely.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$id=$_GET['id'];
writepartnerprefs($id);

///reading partnerprefs from db

$sql="SELECT * FROM partnerprefs WHERE custId = $id";
$result=mysqlexec($sql);
```

This code takes the `id` parameter directly from the URL's query string and uses it in the `WHERE` clause of an SQL `SELECT` query without any sanitization or escaping.

In summary, CVE-2023-46785 is a critical unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability stemming from improper input handling, enabling attackers to potentially gain control over sensitive database information and possibly the entire system.
