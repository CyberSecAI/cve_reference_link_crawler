The content is related to CVE-2021-27499.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application layer encryption of the communication protocol between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud uses non-random Initialization Vectors (IVs) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of non-random IVs with CBC mode encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows man-in-the-middle attackers to tamper with messages being transmitted between the application and the cloud. This could potentially lead to modification of data being sent.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned in a network to intercept traffic between the Ypsomed mylife App and mylife Cloud.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting and modifying network traffic.
- User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
