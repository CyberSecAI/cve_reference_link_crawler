    - #### AMI FirST Builds a Platform of Trust

      The supply chain is a significant cybersecurity threat for mission-critical servers in modern data centers or enterprises. Before a device leaves the manufacturing site, it’s crucial for the original design manufacturers (ODMs), OEMs and firmware suppliers to work together to ensure the firmware is attested. At AMI, we are committed to helping maintain firmware integrity throughout the supply chain.

  + [Zero Trust Firmware](/zero-trust-firmware/)
    - #### Zero Trust Security Starts with Firmware

      Zero Trust security is essential for protecting an organization’s infrastructure and business critical data in today’s digital transformation. But without secure firmware running on the infrastructure, Zero Trust strategy weakens significantly.

      From your car to airport kiosks and power grids, nearly all technology is powered by firmware and for that reason, firmware attacks are on the rise. Firmware attacks are much more dangerous than OS-based attacks because firmware is invisible to OS-based security solutions.

      AMI’s Zero Trust firmware security solutions can help maintain firmware integrity and strengthen organizations’ Zero trust strategy.

    - #### Empower Your Arm Devices With AMI Foundational Firmware

      As an Arm license partner, one of your main objectives is to bring your designs to the market as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this process can be fraught with challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles you may encounter is in the development of firmware. Firmware is a critical component of your device, ensuring that it powers on, runs securely, and stays on during its lifecycle. Developing firmware that meets these requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it is essential for the success of your device.
