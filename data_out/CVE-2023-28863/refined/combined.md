    - #### AMI FirST Builds a Platform of Trust

      The supply chain is a significant cybersecurity threat for mission-critical servers in modern data centers or enterprises. Before a device leaves the manufacturing site, it’s crucial for the original design manufacturers (ODMs), OEMs and firmware suppliers to work together to ensure the firmware is attested. At AMI, we are committed to helping maintain firmware integrity throughout the supply chain.

    - #### Zero Trust Security Starts with Firmware

      Zero Trust security is essential for protecting an organization’s infrastructure and business critical data in today’s digital transformation. But without secure firmware running on the infrastructure, Zero Trust strategy weakens significantly.

      From your car to airport kiosks and power grids, nearly all technology is powered by firmware and for that reason, firmware attacks are on the rise. Firmware attacks are much more dangerous than OS-based attacks because firmware is invisible to OS-based security solutions.

      AMI’s Zero Trust firmware security solutions can help maintain firmware integrity and strengthen organizations’ Zero trust strategy.

    - #### Empower Your Arm Devices With AMI Foundational Firmware

      As an Arm license partner, one of your main objectives is to bring your designs to the market as quickly and efficiently as possible. However, this process can be fraught with challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles you may encounter is in the development of firmware. Firmware is a critical component of your device, ensuring that it powers on, runs securely, and stays on during its lifecycle. Developing firmware that meets these requirements can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it is essential for the success of your device.

## BMC software fails to validate IPMI session.

#### Vulnerability Note VU#163057

Original Release Date: 2024-04-30 | Last Revised: 2024-08-23

---

### Overview

The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementations in multiple manufacturer's Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software are vulnerable to IPMI session hijacking. An attacker with access to the BMC network (with IPMI enabled) can abuse the lack of session integrity to hijack sessions and execute arbitrary IPMI commands on the BMC.

### Description

IPMI is a computer interface specification that provides a low-level management capability independent of hardware, firmware, or operating system. IPMI is supported by many BMC manufacturers to allow for transparent access to hardware. IPMI also supports pre-boot capabilities of a computer such as selection of boot media and boot environment. BMCs are recommended to be accessible via [dedicated internal networks](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2013/07/26/risks-using-intelligent-platform-management-interface-ipmi) to avoid risk of exposure.

IPMI sessions between a client and a BMC follow the RAKP key exchange protocol, as specified in the [IPMI 2.0 specification](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/ipmi-second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-1.pdf). This involves a session ID and a BMC random number to uniquely identify an IPMI session. The security researcher, who wishes to remain anonymous, has attempted to disclose two vulnerabilities related to BMC software and session management. The first vulnerability identifies the use of weak randomization while interacting with a BMC using IPMI sessions. The researcher discovered that if both the IPMI session ID and BMC's random number are predictable or constant, an attacker can either hijack a session or replay a session without knowing the password that was set to protect the BMC. The second vulnerability from the reporter identifies certain cases where the BMC software fails to enforce previously negotiated IPMI 2.0 session parameters, allowing an attacker to either downgrade or disable session verification. Due to the reuse of software or libraries, these vulnerabilities may be present in multiple models of BMC. It is recommended that sufficient precaution is taken in protecting datacenters and cloud installations with multiple servers to protect IPMI session interaction using both the software updates and the recommendations to secure and isolate the networks where IPMI is accessible.

### Impact

An unauthenticated attacker with access to the BMC network can predict IPMI session IDs and/or BMC random numbers to replay a previous session or hijack an IPMI session. This can allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the BMC and be able to perform high-privileged functions (reboot, power-off, re-image of the machine) that are available to the BMC.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

Please consult the Vendor Information section for information provided by BMC vendors to address these vulnerabilities.

#### Restrict access

As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks to the BMC network that exposes the IPMI enabled interface.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to the security researcher who would like to remain anonymous for researching and reporting these vulnerabilities.
