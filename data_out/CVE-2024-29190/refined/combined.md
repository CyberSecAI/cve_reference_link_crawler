# SSRF Vulnerability on assetlinks\_check(act\_name, well\_knowns)

## Description

### Summary

While examining the "App Link assetlinks.json file could not be found" vulnerability detected by MobSF, we, as the Trendyol Application Security team, noticed that a GET request was sent to the "/.well-known/assetlinks.json" endpoint for all hosts written with "android:host". In the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Since MobSF does not perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in "android:host", requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This may cause SSRF vulnerability.

### Details

Example <intent-filter structure in AndroidManifest.xml:

```
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
<action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
<category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
<data android:host="192.168.1.102/user/delete/1#" android:scheme="http" />
</intent-filter>

```

We defined it as android:host="192.168.1.102/user/delete/1#". Here, the "#" character at the end of the host prevents requests from being sent to the "/.well-known/assetlinks.json" endpoint and ensures that requests are sent to the endpoint before it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
