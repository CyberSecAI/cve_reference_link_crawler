- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The System Monitor application exposes sensitive information when accessed over HTTP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200). Specifically, credentials can be exposed when accessed over HTTP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service, sensitive information disclosure, and integrity issues leading to potential operational failures.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based access to the application via HTTP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application over HTTP. No authentication is required (PR:N).
