Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-21198:

**Root Cause:**
*   Time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in the BIOS firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability is a race condition, specifically a TOCTOU issue. This means that a check is made on a resource, and then the resource is used later. If a malicious actor can modify the resource in between the check and the use, it can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Escalation of privilege. A privileged user can potentially elevate their privileges to an unauthorized level.
*   Integrity and availability of the system could be compromised (as indicated by the CVSS vector having high ratings for those).
*   The CVSS vector indicates there is no impact to confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have privileged access to the system. This is indicated by the "PR:H" (Privileges Required: High) in the CVSS vector.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition.

**Affected Products:**
The following product lines are affected:
*   11th Gen Intel® Core™ processors and Intel® Xeon® W processors (Server, Workstation, Desktop, Mobile)
*   12th Gen Intel® Core™ processors, Intel® Pentium® Gold processors, and Intel® Celeron® processors (Desktop, Mobile)
*   10th Gen Intel® Core™ processors and Intel® Xeon® W processor family (Mobile, Workstation)
*   Intel® Core™ processors with Intel® Hybrid Technology (Mobile)
*    Intel® Pentium® Silver N6000, Intel® Celeron® N4000 and N5000 processors (Desktop, Mobile)
*    10th Gen Intel® Core™ processors (Desktop, Workstation, Mobile)
*    10000/1200 series Pentium Gold and Celeron processors (Mobile)

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the BIOS firmware.
*   Intel recommends updating to the latest BIOS versions provided by system manufacturers.
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Intel employees.
