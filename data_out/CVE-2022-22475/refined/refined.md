- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty when the `appSecurity-1.0`, `appSecurity-2.0`, `appSecurity-3.0`, or `appSecurity-4.0` feature is enabled. This flaw allows for identity spoofing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Identity spoofing vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially spoof identities, which could lead to unauthorized access or actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it is related to the way the application handles security when the mentioned features are enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The required attacker capabilities or position are not explicitly detailed, but it implies the attacker would need to interact with the application in a way that exploits the identified vulnerability.
