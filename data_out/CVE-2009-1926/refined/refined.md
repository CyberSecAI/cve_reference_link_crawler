{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the Windows TCP/IP stack allowing connections to hang indefinitely in the FIN-WAIT-1 or FIN-WAIT-2 state under certain conditions. Specifically, if an application closes a TCP connection with pending data to be sent and an attacker has set a small or zero TCP receive window size, the affected server will not be able to completely close the TCP connection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of TCP connections",
      "Failure to properly close TCP connections when pending data exists and a small or zero TCP receive window is set",
      "Resource exhaustion due to orphaned connections"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by flooding a system with specially crafted packets, causing the affected system to stop responding to new requests. The system would remain non-responsive even after the attacker stops sending malicious packets.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Sending specially crafted TCP/IP packets with a small or zero TCP receive window size",
      "Flooding a system with connections designed to keep the TCP connection state in the FIN-WAIT-1 or FIN-WAIT-2 state indefinitely."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required.",
    "affected_systems": [
