## Vulnerabilities in Windows TCP/IP Could Allow Remote Code Execution (967723)

Published: September 08, 2009 | Updated: September 10, 2009

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) processing. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent specially crafted TCP/IP packets over the network to a computer with a listening service. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, and Low for all supported editions of Windows XP. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by dropping existing TCP connections adaptively and limiting the number of new TCP connections until system resources are restored, and changing the manner in which TCP/IP packets are processed. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**If Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is listed as an affected product, why is Microsoft not issuing an update for it?**

The architecture to properly support TCP/IP protection does not exist on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require rearchitecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating system, not just the affected component. The product of such a rearchitecture effort would be sufficiently incompatible with Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 that there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 would continue to operate on the updated system. The impact of a denial of service attack is that a system would become unresponsive due to memory consumption. However, a successful attack requires a sustained flood of specially crafted TCP packets, and the system will recover once the flood ceases. Microsoft recommends that customers running Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 use a firewall to block access to the affected ports and limit the attack surface from untrusted networks.

**If Windows XP is listed as an affected product, why is Microsoft not issuing an update for it?**

By default, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Service Pack 3, and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2 do not have a listening service configured in the client firewall and are therefore not affected by this vulnerability. Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later operating systems include a stateful host firewall that provides protection for computers against incoming traffic from the Internet or from neighboring network devices on a private network. The impact of a denial of service attack is that a system would become unresponsive due to memory consumption. However, a successful attack requires a sustained flood of specially crafted TCP packets, and the system will recover once the flood ceases. This makes the severity rating Low for Windows XP. Windows XP is not affected by CVE-2009-1925. Customers running Windows XP are at reduced risk, and Microsoft recommends they use the firewall included with the operating system, or a network firewall, to block access to the affected ports and limit the attack surface from untrusted networks.

**Does this update completely remove the vulnerabilities, TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609 and TCP/IP Orphaned Connections Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1926?**

Since the denial of service vulnerabilities, CVE-2008-4609 and CVE-2009-1926, affect the TCP/IP protocol itself, the updates for Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 do not completely remove the vulnerabilities; the updates merely provide more resilience to sustain operations during a flooding attack. Also, these denial of service vulnerabilities can be further mitigated through the use of NAT and reverse proxy servers, further lowering the severity of this issue on client workstations.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609

A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP processing in Microsoft Windows due to the way that Windows handles an excessive number of established TCP connections. The effect of this vulnerability can be amplified by the requirement to process specially crafted packets with a TCP receive window size set to a very small value or zero. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by flooding a system with specially crafted packets causing the affected system to stop responding to new requests or automatically restart.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-4609](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2008-4609).

#### Mitigating Factors for TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* In Windows Vista, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability, since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.

#### Workarounds for TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall**

  All supported editions of Windows Vista come with Windows Firewall, a two-way firewall that is automatically enabled.

  For all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, use the Internet Connection Firewall feature to help protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Network Connections** and then click **Change Windows Firewall Settings**.
  3. On the **General** tab, ensure that the **On (recommended)** value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.
  4. When the Windows Firewall is enabled, select **Donât allow exceptions** to prohibit all incoming traffic.

  For Windows Server 2003 systems, configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection using the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.

#### FAQ for TCP/IP Zero Window Size Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4609

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is present because the Windows TCP/IP stack does not properly handle large numbers of established TCP connections. If these established connections are abused by a remote system requesting data and setting the TCP receive window size to a small or a zero value, the denial-of-service condition can be amplified. The TCP connections can also be kept alive by the attacker by sending ACK packets to the server. An excessive number of these malicious connections could consume server resources and prevent the server from responding to legitimate connections.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What is the TCP Receive Window Size?**

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) receive window size is the maximum amount of received data, in bytes, that can be buffered at one time on the receiving side of a connection. The sending host can send only that amount of data before waiting for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host. A TCP receive windows size set to zero keeps the connection alive, but prevents the transmission for passing any additional bytes of data until the window size is increased. For more information about TCP receive windows size option, see the MSDN article, [TCP Receive Window Size and Window Scaling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms819736.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an affected system to become non-responsive.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by flooding a system with an excessive number of TCP connections and keeping them alive indefinitely, or by sending specially crafted packets with the TCP receive window size set to a very small value or zero.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, servers are at primary risk from this vulnerability because they are more likely to have a service listening on the network. Protocols or programs that maintain long sessions and have predictable TCP/IP information are at an increased risk of exploitation from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by dropping existing TCP connections adaptively and limiting the number of new TCP connections until system resources are restored.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

While the initial report was provided through responsible disclosure, the vulnerability was later disclosed publicly by a separate party. This security bulletin addresses the publicly disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## TCP/IP Timestamps Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1925

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows TCP/IP stack due to the TCP/IP stack not cleaning up state information correctly. This causes the TCP/IP stack to reference a field as a function pointer when it actually contains other information. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted TCP/IP packets to a computer that has a service listening over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1925](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1925).

## TCP/IP Orphaned Connections Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1926

A denial of service vulnerability exists in TCP/IP processing in Microsoft Windows due to an error in the processing of specially crafted packets with a small or zero TCP receive window size. If an application closes a TCP connection with pending data to be sent and an attacker has set a small or zero TCP receive window size, the affected server will not be able to completely close the TCP connection. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by flooding a system with specially crafted packets causing the affected system to stop responding to new requests. The system would remain non-responsive even after the attacker stops sending malicious packets.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1926](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1926).

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to the Windows TCP/IP stack allowing connections to hang indefinitely in the FIN-WAIT-1 or FIN-WAIT-2 state under certain conditions.

**What is TCP/IP?**

TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954).

**What are FIN-WAIT-1 and FIN-WAIT-2 states?**

A TCP connection goes through a series of different states during a transaction between client and server. The FIN-WAIT-1 state represents a system waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent. The FIN-WAIT-2 state represents a system waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP. For more information, see [RFC 793](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt).

**What is the TCP Receive Window Size?**

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) receive window size is the maximum amount of received data, in bytes, that can be buffered at one time on the receiving side of a connection. The sending host can send only that amount of data before waiting for an acknowledgment and window update from the receiving host. A TCP receive windows size set to zero keeps the connection alive, but prevents the transmission for passing any additional bytes of data until the window size is increased. For more information about TCP receive windows size option, see the MSDN article, [TCP Receive Window Size and Window Scaling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms819736.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an affected system to become non-responsive.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by flooding a system with specially crafted connections designed to keep the TCP connection state in the FIN-WAIT-1 or FIN-WAIT-2 state indefinitely.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, servers are at primary risk from this vulnerability because they are more likely to have a service listening on the network. Protocols or programs that maintain long sessions and have predictable TCP/IP information are at an increased risk to this issue.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by dropping existing TCP connections adaptively and limiting the number of new TCP connections until system resources are restored.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
