Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-45370:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing authorization check in the `Special:SportsManagerLogo` and `Special:SportsTeamsManagerLogo` special pages of the MediaWiki SportsTeams extension. While the constructors of these special pages include `sportsteamsmanager` as a parameter, this does not properly restrict access. The pages also check for basic upload user rights, database lock, and directory writability but lack specific authorization for the `sportsteamsmanager` user right, which is required to use them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is a missing authorization check for the `sportsteamsmanager` user right in the `execute()` or `executeLogo()` methods of the mentioned special pages.
*   **Incorrect Constructor Usage:** The constructor of the special pages were not properly using the `sportsteamsmanager` right to enforce access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Logo Uploads:**  Users without the `sportsteamsmanager` user right could potentially upload logos through these special pages.
*   **Potential Data Modification:** While not explicitly stated, there's an implicit risk of a user with basic upload rights using these pages to upload potentially malicious files (images), which could cause harm if they override legit files.
*   **Lack of Logging:** The lack of logging for uploads through these special pages would make it difficult to debug attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Special Pages:** An attacker would directly access the `Special:SportsManagerLogo` and `Special:SportsTeamsManagerLogo` pages.
*   **Manipulating URL Parameters:** The attacker would need to manually set the correct id URL parameter to perform unauthorized actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker would need to be a registered user on the MediaWiki instance.
*   **Basic Upload User Right:** The attacker would need to possess basic upload rights, which are commonly granted to most registered users.
*   **Knowledge of URL Parameters:** The attacker needs to be able to understand and manipulate URL parameters related to the special pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was found in the MediaWiki SportsTeams extension, which is not widely used.
*   The vulnerability was considered not super exploitable due to the need for manual manipulation of URL parameters.
*   The fix involved adding proper authorization checks in the `execute()` or `executeLogo()` methods to ensure only users with the `sportsteamsmanager` right could access them.
*   A patch was created and merged to resolve the issue.
