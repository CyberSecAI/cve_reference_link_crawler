- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zotpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The plugin has an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website, which would execute when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly defined in the provided text but implies injection through user input or other means that the plugin does not sanitize, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A contributor role is mentioned but this does not indicate the necessary privileges or position for an attacker to exploit the XSS vulnerability. The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code.
