This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Openfind products. While it doesn't specify a single CVE, it details several security issues that were addressed in a security patch. One of these issues is a stack overflow vulnerability related to IMAP4, which could potentially be the one described in CVE-2024-6741 based on the CVE description placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Overflow:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A stack overflow vulnerability is present when using the IMAP4 service in Mail2000 (versions 7.0 and 8.0) under certain operations during account authorization.
    *   **Weakness:** A buffer overflow can occur on the stack due to uncontrolled or improperly handled input while interacting with the IMAP4 service.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other unintended consequences.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, by sending specially crafted IMAP4 requests to the affected service.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to interact with the IMAP4 service, and some understanding of the vulnerability to trigger it.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Mail2000 (versions 7.0 and 8.0).
    *   **Weakness:**  The web application allows for injecting malicious script into web pages.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can steal user cookies and session information, hijack user accounts, and potentially gain access to sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injection of malicious scripts via user-provided input into the web application.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** Attackers need to be able to inject scripts into web page, possibly by crafted emails or other web input methods.
*   **Cookie Security:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cookies were not protected with the HttpOnly flag
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of HttpOnly flag on cookies used by MailGates, MailAudit (V6.0), and Mail2000 (V7.0, V8.0) web interface.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side scripts like Javascript can access and steal cookie values, leading to unauthorized session access and data theft.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitable via XSS.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to inject and run client-side script.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   MailGates V6.0
*   MailAudit V6.0
*   Mail2000 V7.0
*   Mail2000 V8.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the security patches provided by Openfind.
*   MailGates/MailAudit V6.0 should be updated to patch 6.1.7.040
*   Mail2000 V7.0 should be updated to patch 131, and V8.0 to SP2 044.
