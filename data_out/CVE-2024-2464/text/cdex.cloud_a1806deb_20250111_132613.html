Prof. Maciej Sułowicz
Cracow University of Technology

Modern warfare encompasses more than conventional weaponry. It involves a clash of technologies, processes, and competencies. This is why training the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is of immense importance. In this context, the role of the cyber range becomes pivotal, where ‘red’ and ‘blue’ teams compete in virtual attack and defence scenarios, meticulously working through diverse real-world situations.

Valeriy Tsiupa

Thanks to the CDeX platform, our national Cyber Security exercises have become more engaging and convenient.
