Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-2464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an observable discrepancy in the application's password recovery mechanism. Specifically, the system provides different responses during the password reset process, which reveals whether a given username is valid or not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The observable discrepancy allows an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.
- **CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy:** The core issue is that the application's behavior reveals sensitive information (username validity) through different responses, which is a form of information leakage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** An attacker can build a list of valid user accounts.
- **Brute-force attacks:** Armed with a list of valid user accounts, attackers can then target those accounts with brute-force or password-guessing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the password recovery mechanism.
- An attacker interacts with the password reset functionality of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or prior access.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the password recovery feature of the application (e.g., through the public web interface).
