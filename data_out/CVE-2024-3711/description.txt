The Brizy â€“ Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin setting update due to a missing capability check on the functions action_request_disable, action_change_template, and action_request_enable in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.43. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or above, to enable/disable the Brizy editor and modify the template used.
