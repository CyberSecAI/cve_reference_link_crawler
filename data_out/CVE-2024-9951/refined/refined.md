Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9951

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'wppa-tab' parameter in the WP Photo Album Plus plugin. This lack of proper handling of user-supplied input allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into vulnerable pages.
- If a user clicks on a crafted link containing malicious JavaScript, this could lead to:
   -  User session hijacking
   -  Defacement of the website
   -  Redirection to malicious sites
   -  Information theft
   -  Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in the `wppa-tab` parameter.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on this malicious URL. This can be done through social engineering, phishing attacks, or by inserting the malicious link on another website the target is likely to visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious link to their target.
- The attacker needs to rely on the user to click the link to execute the injected script.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the WP Photo Album Plus plugin up to and including 8.8.05.003.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.8.07.004.
- The provided changeset details show the change to `wppa-settings-autosave.php`, where the `wppa_get` function is now called with `'text'` to sanitize the tab input, and `'int'` to sanitize subtab inputs, resolving the vulnerability.
