{
  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2017-10135",
    "Description": "The PKCS#8 implementation in the JCE component of OpenJDK has a timing attack vulnerability. A remote attacker with the ability to make a Java application repeatedly compare PKCS#8 keys against an attacker-controlled value could potentially use this flaw to determine the key via a timing side channel.",
     "Root cause": "Timing attack vulnerability in the PKCS#8 implementation",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Timing side channel in PKCS#8 key comparisons."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could extract certain information about the used key via a timing side channel, potentially leading to key compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Network access to a Java application using the vulnerable JCE component."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to induce a Java application to repeatedly compare PKCS#8 keys against attacker-controlled values",
     "Knowledge of how to measure timing differences in the Java application"
    ]
  }
