  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131) in the Controller 6000 and Controller 7000 OSDP message handling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper calculation of buffer size when processing OSDP messages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with physical access to Controller wiring can cause a reboot, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the controller wiring, potentially through tampering with the reader or wiring.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Physical access to the Controller wiring of affected systems, with the ability to tamper with reader wiring. No authentication is required."
