### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Frontend Admin by DynamiApps" WordPress plugin, specifically versions 3.19.4 and below, related to improper handling of missing encryption exceptions. This vulnerability is due to the plugin's failure to properly handle the absence of the 'openssl' PHP extension, leading to form manipulation.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause of the vulnerability is the plugin's inadequate handling of the scenario where the 'openssl' PHP extension is not loaded on the server. The plugin uses the `openssl_encrypt` and `openssl_decrypt` functions for encryption and decryption. However, instead of failing securely, the plugin would fall back to `base64_encode` and `json_decode( base64_decode( $data ), true )` respectively when the openssl extension is not available in versions 3.19.4 and below. This bypasses the intended encryption.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- **Improper Missing Encryption Exception Handling:** The plugin does not properly handle the case where the `openssl` extension is not available, falling back to insecure methods.
- **Form Manipulation:** Unauthenticated attackers can manipulate user processing forms, post processing forms, and potentially bypass authentication.

### Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can add or edit administrator users, potentially gaining full control over the WordPress site.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can automatically log in as other users, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts through manipulating post processing forms.

### Attack vectors:
- The attack vector is unauthenticated access through the plugin's frontend forms.
- It requires the 'openssl' PHP extension to be absent from the server.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attackers need to be unauthenticated users.
- Attackers must be able to send requests to the WordPress site's frontend.
- No special privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to target WordPress installs where the 'openssl' PHP extension is not loaded.
