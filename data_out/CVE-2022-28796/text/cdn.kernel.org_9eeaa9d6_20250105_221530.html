llc: only change llc->dev when bind() succeeds
commit 2d327a79ee176930dc72c131a970c891d367c1dc upstream.
My latest patch, attempting to fix the refcount leak in a minimal
way turned out to add a new bug.
Whenever the bind operation fails before we attempt to grab
a reference count on a device, we might release the device refcount
of a prior successful bind() operation.
syzbot was not happy about this [1].
Note to stable teams:
Make sure commit b37a46683739 ("netdevice: add the case if dev is NULL")
is already present in your trees.

don't.

m68k: fix access\_ok for coldfire
commit 26509034bef198525d5936c116cbd0c3fa491c0b upstream.
While most m68k platforms use separate address spaces for user
and kernel space, at least coldfire does not, and the other
ones have a TASK\_SIZE that is less than the entire 4GB address
range.
Using the default implementation of \_\_access\_ok() stops coldfire
user space from trivially accessing kernel memory.

wcn36xx: Differentiate wcn3660 from wcn3620
commit 98d504a82cc75840bec8e3c6ae0e4f411921962b upstream.
The spread of capability between the three WiFi silicon parts wcn36xx
supports is:
wcn3620 - 802.11 a/b/g
wcn3660 - 802.11 a/b/g/n
wcn3680 - 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac
We currently treat wcn3660 as wcn3620 thus limiting it to 2GHz channels.
Fix this regression by ensuring we differentiate between all three parts.

tpm: use try\_get\_ops() in tpm-space.c
commit fb5abce6b2bb5cb3d628aaa63fa821da8c4600f9 upstream.
As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/
exposure of the chip->tpm\_mutex was removed from much of the upper
level code. In this conversion, tpm2\_del\_space() was missed. This
didn't matter much because it's usually called closely after a
converted operation, so there's only a very tiny race window where the
chip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a
NULL deref on the mutex. However, there are reports of this window
being hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2\_del\_space() to
use tpm\_try\_get\_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before
acquring the mutex.

The reason for this warning is the attempt to get the chip->dev reference
in tpm\_common\_write() although the reference counter is already zero.
Since commit 8979b02aaf1d ("tpm: Fix reference count to main device") the
extra reference used to prevent a premature zero counter is never taken,
because the required TPM\_CHIP\_FLAG\_TPM2 flag is never set.
Fix this by moving the TPM 2 character device handling from
tpm\_chip\_alloc() to tpm\_add\_char\_device() which is called at a later point
in time when the flag has been set in case of TPM2.
Commit fdc915f7f719 ("tpm: expose spaces via a device link /dev/tpmrm")
already introduced function tpm\_devs\_release() to release the extra
reference but did not implement the required put on chip->devs that results
in the call of this function.
Fix this by putting chip->devs in tpm\_chip\_unregister().
Finally move the new implementation for the TPM 2 handling into a new
function to avoid multiple checks for the TPM\_CHIP\_FLAG\_TPM2 flag in the
good case and error cases.

mac80211: fix potential double free on mesh join
commit 4a2d4496e15ea5bb5c8e83b94ca8ca7fb045e7d3 upstream.
While commit 6a01afcf8468 ("mac80211: mesh: Free ie data when leaving
mesh") fixed a memory leak on mesh leave / teardown it introduced a
potential memory corruption caused by a double free when rejoining the
mesh:
ieee80211\_leave\_mesh()
-> kfree(sdata->u.mesh.ie);
...
ieee80211\_join\_mesh()
-> copy\_mesh\_setup()
-> old\_ie = ifmsh->ie;
-> kfree(old\_ie);
This double free / kernel panics can be reproduced by using wpa\_supplicant
with an encrypted mesh (if set up without encryption via "iw" then
ifmsh->ie is always NULL, which avoids this issue). And then calling:
$ iw dev mesh0 mesh leave
$ iw dev mesh0 mesh join my-mesh
Note that typically these commands are not used / working when using
wpa\_supplicant. And it seems that wpa\_supplicant or wpa\_cli are going
through a NETDEV\_DOWN/NETDEV\_UP cycle between a mesh leave and mesh join
where the NETDEV\_UP resets the mesh.ie to NULL via a memcpy of
default\_mesh\_setup in cfg80211\_netdev\_notifier\_call, which then avoids
the memory corruption, too.
The issue was first observed in an application which was not using
wpa\_supplicant but "Senf" instead, which implements its own calls to
nl80211.
Fixing the issue by removing the kfree()'ing of the mesh IE in the mesh
join function and leaving it solely up to the mesh leave to free the
mesh IE.

uaccess: fix integer overflow on access\_ok()

Three architectures check the end of a user access against the
address limit without taking a possible overflow into account.
Passing a negative length or another overflow in here returns
success when it should not.
Use the most common correct implementation here, which optimizes
for a constant 'size' argument, and turns the common case into a
single comparison.

rcu: Don't deboost before reporting expedited quiescent state
commit 10c535787436d62ea28156a4b91365fd89b5a432 upstream.
Currently rcu\_preempt\_deferred\_qs\_irqrestore() releases rnp->boost\_mtx
before reporting the expedited quiescent state. Under heavy real-time
load, this can result in this function being preempted before the
quiescent state is reported, which can in turn prevent the expedited grace
period from completing. Tim Murray reports that the resulting expedited
grace periods can take hundreds of milliseconds and even more than one
second, when they should normally complete in less than a millisecond.
This was fine given that there were no particular response-time
constraints for synchronize\_rcu\_expedited(), as it was designed
for throughput rather than latency. However, some users now need
sub-100-millisecond response-time constratints.
This patch therefore follows Neeraj's suggestion (seconded by Tim and
by Uladzislau Rezki) of simply reversing the two operations.

So check for journal->j\_running\_transaction everytime we release and

Bluetooth: btusb: Use quirk to skip HCI\_FLT\_CLEAR\_ALL on fake CSR controllers
commit b3cf94c8b6b2f1a2b94825a025db291da2b151fd upstream.
Another subset of the more recent batch of Chinese clones aren't
specs-compliant and seem to lock up whenever they receive a
HCI\_OP\_SET\_EVENT\_FLT with flt\_type set to zero/HCI\_FLT\_CLEAR\_ALL,
which on Linux (until the recent HCI state-machine refactor) happened
right at BR/EDR setup. As there are other less-straightforward ways
of reaching those operations, this patch is still relevant.
So, while all the previous efforts to wrangle the herd of fake CSRs
seem to be paying off (and these also get detected as such) we
still need to take care of this quirk; testers seem to agree
that these dongles tend to work well enough afterwards.
From some cursory USB packet capture on Windows it seems like
that driver doesn't appear to use this clear-all functionality at all.
This patch was tested on some really popular AliExpress-style
dongles, in my case marked as "V5.0". Chip markings: UG8413,
the backside of the PCB says "USB Dangel" (sic).
Here is the `hciconfig -a` output; for completeness:

crypto: qat - disable registration of algorithms
commit 8893d27ffcaf6ec6267038a177cb87bcde4dd3de upstream.
The implementations of aead and skcipher in the QAT driver do not
support properly requests with the CRYPTO\_TFM\_REQ\_MAY\_BACKLOG flag set.
If the HW queue is full, the driver returns -EBUSY but does not enqueue
the request.
This can result in applications like dm-crypt waiting indefinitely for a
completion of a request that was never submitted to the hardware.
To avoid this problem, disable the registration of all crypto algorithms
in the QAT driver by setting the number of crypto instances to 0 at
configuration time.

ACPI: video: Force backlight native for Clevo NL5xRU and NL5xNU
commit c844d22fe0c0b37dc809adbdde6ceb6462c43acf upstream.
Clevo NL5xRU and NL5xNU/TUXEDO Aura 15 Gen1 and Gen2 have both a working
native and video interface. However the default detection mechanism first
registers the video interface before unregistering it again and switching
to the native interface during boot. This results in a dangling SBIOS
request for backlight change for some reason, causing the backlight to
switch to ~2% once per boot on the first power cord connect or disconnect
event. Setting the native interface explicitly circumvents this buggy
behaviour by avoiding the unregistering process.

For some reason, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 uses the standard ACPI

HID. Instead it uses MSHW0146 as identifier. Add that ID to the driver

Additionally, the power state is not updated immediately after the AC

ACPI / x86: Work around broken XSDT on Advantech DAC-BJ01 board
commit e702196bf85778f2c5527ca47f33ef2e2fca8297 upstream.
On this board the ACPI RSDP structure points to both a RSDT and an XSDT,
but the XSDT points to a truncated FADT. This causes all sorts of trouble
and usually a complete failure to boot after the following error occurs:
ACPI Error: Unsupported address space: 0x20 (\*/hwregs-\*)
ACPI Error: AE\_SUPPORT, Unable to initialize fixed events (\*/evevent-\*)
ACPI: Unable to start ACPI Interpreter
This leaves the ACPI implementation in such a broken state that subsequent
kernel subsystem initialisations go wrong, resulting in among others
mismapped PCI memory, SATA and USB enumeration failures, and freezes.
As this is an older embedded platform that will likely never see any BIOS
updates to address this issue and its default shipping OS only complies to
ACPI 1.0, work around this by forcing `acpi=rsdt`. This patch, applied on
top of Linux 5.10.102, was confirmed on real hardware to fix the issue.

ALSA: pci: fix reading of swapped values from pcmreg in AC97 codec
commit 17aaf0193392cb3451bf0ac75ba396ec4cbded6e upstream.
Tests 72 and 78 for ALSA in kselftest fail due to reading
inconsistent values from some devices on a VirtualBox
Virtual Machine using the snd\_intel8x0 driver for the AC'97
Audio Controller device.
Taking for example test number 72, this is what the test reports:
"Surround Playback Volume.0 expected 1 but read 0, is\_volatile 0"
"Surround Playback Volume.1 expected 0 but read 1, is\_volatile 0"
These errors repeat for each value from 0 to 31.
Taking a look at these error messages it is possible to notice
that the written values are read back swapped.
When the write is performed, these values are initially stored in
an array used to sanity-check them and write them in the pcmreg
array. To write them, the two one-byte values are packed together
in a two-byte variable through bitwise operations: the first
value is shifted left by one byte and the second value is stored in the
right byte through a bitwise OR. When reading the values back,
right shifts are performed to retrieve the previously stored
bytes. These shifts are executed in the wrong order, thus
reporting the values swapped as shown above.
This patch fixes this mistake by reversing the read
operations' order.

ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prepare and hw\_params/hw\_free calls
commit 3c3201f8c7bb77eb53b08a3ca8d9a4ddc500b4c0 upstream.
Like the previous fixes to hw\_params and hw\_free ioctl races, we need
to paper over the concurrent prepare ioctl calls against hw\_params and
hw\_free, too.
This patch implements the locking with the existing
runtime->buffer\_mutex for prepare ioctls. Unlike the previous case
for snd\_pcm\_hw\_hw\_params() and snd\_pcm\_hw\_free(), snd\_pcm\_prepare() is
performed to the linked streams, hence the lock can't be applied
simply on the top. For tracking the lock in each linked substream, we
modify snd\_pcm\_action\_group() slightly and apply the buffer\_mutex for
the case stream\_lock=false (formerly there was no lock applied)
there.

ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent read/write and buffer changes
commit dca947d4d26dbf925a64a6cfb2ddbc035e831a3d upstream.
In the current PCM design, the read/write syscalls (as well as the
equivalent ioctls) are allowed before the PCM stream is running, that
is, at PCM PREPARED state. Meanwhile, we also allow to re-issue
hw\_params and hw\_free ioctl calls at the PREPARED state that may
change or free the buffers, too. The problem is that there is no
protection against those mix-ups.
This patch applies the previously introduced runtime->buffer\_mutex to
the read/write operations so that the concurrent hw\_params or hw\_free
call can no longer interfere during the operation. The mutex is
unlocked before scheduling, so we don't take it too long.

ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent hw\_params and hw\_free calls
commit 92ee3c60ec9fe64404dc035e7c41277d74aa26cb upstream.
Currently we have neither proper check nor protection against the
concurrent calls of PCM hw\_params and hw\_free ioctls, which may result
in a UAF. Since the existing PCM stream lock can't be used for
protecting the whole ioctl operations, we need a new mutex to protect
those racy calls.
This patch introduced a new mutex, runtime->buffer\_mutex, and applies
it to both hw\_params and hw\_free ioctl code paths. Along with it, the
both functions are slightly modified (the mmap\_count check is moved
into the state-check block) for code simplicity.

ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix headset mic problem for a HP machine with alc671
commit 882bd07f564f97fca6e42ce6ce627ce24ce1ef5a upstream.
On a HP 288 Pro G8, the front mic could not be detected.In order to
get it working, the pin configuration needs to be set correctly, and
the ALC671\_FIXUP\_HP\_HEADSET\_MIC2 fixup needs to be applied.

ALSA: usb-audio: add mapping for new Corsair Virtuoso SE
commit cd94df1795418056a19ff4cb44eadfc18ac99a57 upstream.
New device id for Corsair Virtuoso SE RGB Wireless that currently is not
in the mixer\_map. This entry in the mixer\_map is necessary in order to
label its mixer appropriately and allow userspace to pick the correct
volume controls. For instance, my own Corsair Virtuoso SE RGB Wireless
headset has this new ID and consequently, the sidetone and volume are not
working correctly without this change.

ALSA: oss: Fix PCM OSS buffer allocation overflow
commit efb6402c3c4a7c26d97c92d70186424097b6e366 upstream.
We've got syzbot reports hitting INT\_MAX overflow at vmalloc()
allocation that is called from snd\_pcm\_plug\_alloc(). Although we
apply the restrictions to input parameters, it's based only on the
hw\_params of the underlying PCM device. Since the PCM OSS layer
allocates a temporary buffer for the data conversion, the size may
become unexpectedly large when more channels or higher rates is given;
in the reported case, it went over INT\_MAX, hence it hits WARN\_ON().
This patch is an attempt to avoid such an overflow and an allocation
for too large buffers. First off, it adds the limit of 1MB as the
upper bound for period bytes. This must be large enough for all use
cases, and we really don't want to handle a larger temporary buffer
than this size. The size check is performed at two places, where the
original period bytes is calculated and where the plugin buffer size
is calculated.
In addition, the driver uses array\_size() and array3\_size() for
multiplications to catch overflows for the converted period size and
buffer bytes.

ASoC: sti: Fix deadlock via snd\_pcm\_stop\_xrun() call
commit 455c5653f50e10b4f460ef24e99f0044fbe3401c upstream.
This is essentially a revert of the commit dc865fb9e7c2 ("ASoC: sti:
Use snd\_pcm\_stop\_xrun() helper"), which converted the manual
snd\_pcm\_stop() calls with snd\_pcm\_stop\_xrun().
The commit above introduced a deadlock as snd\_pcm\_stop\_xrun() itself
takes the PCM stream lock while the caller already holds it. Since
the conversion was done only for consistency reason and the open-call
with snd\_pcm\_stop() to the XRUN state is a correct usage, let's revert
the commit back as the fix.

tpm: Fix error handling in async work
commit 2e8e4c8f6673247e22efc7985ce5497accd16f88 upstream.
When an invalid (non existing) handle is used in a TPM command,
that uses the resource manager interface (/dev/tpmrm0) the resource
manager tries to load it from its internal cache, but fails and
the tpm\_dev\_transmit returns an -EINVAL error to the caller.
The existing async handler doesn't handle these error cases
currently and the condition in the poll handler never returns
mask with EPOLLIN set.
The result is that the poll call blocks and the application gets stuck
until the user\_read\_timer wakes it up after 120 sec.
Change the tpm\_dev\_async\_work function to handle error conditions
returned from tpm\_dev\_transmit they are also reflected in the poll mask
and a correct error code could passed back to the caller.
