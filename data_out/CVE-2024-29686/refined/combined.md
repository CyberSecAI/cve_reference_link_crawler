##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CMS Themes

## [#](#introduction "Permalink")Introduction

Themes define the appearance of your website or web application built with Winter. Winter themes are completely file-backed and can be managed with any version control system, for example, Git. This page gives you the high-level description of Winter themes. You will find more details about <pages>, <partials>, <layouts> and [content files](content) in the corresponding articles.

> **NOTE:** Themes can store templates in the database if `cms.databaseTemplates` is enabled, see the [database driven themes](#database-driven-themes) section for more information.

Themes are directories that reside in the **/themes** directory by default. Themes can contain the following objects:

| Object | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Pages](pages) | represent the website pages. |
| [Partials](partials) | contain reusable chunks of HTML markup. |
| [Layouts](layouts) | define the page scaffold. |
| [Content files](content) | text, HTML, or [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) blocks that can be edited separately from the page or layout. |
| **Asset files** | are resource files like images, CSS and JavaScript files. |

## [#](#directory-structure "Permalink")Directory structure

Below, you can see an example theme directory structure. Each Winter theme is represented with a separate directory and generally, one active theme is used for displaying the website. This example displays the "example-theme" theme directory.

```
themes/
`-- example-theme/
    |-- assets/                 # Theme assets
    |   |-- css/
    |   |-- fonts/
    |   |-- images/
    |   |-- javascript/
    |   |-- scss/
    |   `-- vendor/
    |-- content/                # Static content files
    |   |-- static-pages/       # Content files from the Winter.Pages plugin
    |   |   `-- index.htm
    |   `-- welcome.htm
    |-- layouts/                # Theme Layouts (Page scaffolds / templates)
    |   |-- default.htm
    |   `-- sidebar.htm
    |-- meta/                   # Menu definitions and other plugin specific YAML files
    |   |-- menus/
    |   |   |-- main-menu.yaml
    |   |   `-- sitemap.yaml    # Meta file describing the sitemap
    |   `-- static-pages.yaml   # Meta file describing the structure of the Winter.Pages static pages
    |-- pages/                  # Theme Pages (Contain the routing for the frontend)
    |   |-- 404.htm             # Page for 404 responses
    |   |-- home.htm
    |   |-- error.htm           # Page for 500 responses
    |   `-- sitemap.htm         # Page for rendering the sitemap response
    |-- partials/               # Theme Partials (Reusable pieces of HTML markup)
    |   |-- html-footer.htm
    |   |-- html-header.htm
    |   `-- navbar.htm
    |-- theme.yaml              # Theme information file
    `-- version.yaml            # Theme updates file

```
> The active theme is set with the `activeTheme` parameter in the `config/cms.php` file or with the Theme Selector on the System > CMS > Frontend Theme backend page. The theme set with the Theme Selector overrides the value in the `config/cms.php` file.

### [#](#subdirectories "Permalink")Subdirectories

Winter supports single level subdirectories for **pages**, **partials**, **layouts** and **content** files, while the **assets** directory can have any structure. This simplifies the organization of large websites. In the example directory structure below, you can see that the **pages** and **partials** directories contain the **blog** subdirectory, and the **content** directory contains the **home** subdirectory.

```
themes/
`-- website/
    |-- pages/
    |   |-- home.htm
    |   `-- blog/                  # Subdirectory
    |       |-- archive.htm
    |       `-- category.htm
    |-- partials/
    |   |-- sidebar.htm
    |   `-- blog/                  # Subdirectory
    |       `-- category-list.htm
    `-- content/
       |-- footer-contacts.txt
       `-- home/                   # Subdirectory
           `-- intro.htm

```

To refer to a partial or a content file from a subdirectory, specify the subdirectory's name before the template's name. Example of rendering a partial from a subdirectory:

```
{% partial "blog/category-list" %}

```
> **NOTE:** The template paths are always absolute. If, in a partial, you render another partial from the same subdirectory, you still need to specify the subdirectory's name.

## [#](#template-structure "Permalink")Template structure

Pages, partials and layout templates can include up to 3 sections: **configuration**, **PHP code**, and **Twig markup**.
Sections are separated with the `==` sequence.
For example:

```
url = "/blog"
layout = "default"
==
function onStart()
{
    $this['posts'] = ...;
}
==
<h3>Blog archive</h3>
{% for post in posts %}
    <h4>{{ post.title }}</h4>
    {{ post.content }}
{% endfor %}

```
### [#](#configuration-section "Permalink")Configuration section

The configuration section sets the template parameters. Supported configuration parameters are specific for different CMS templates and described in their corresponding documentation articles. The configuration section uses the simple [INI format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file), where string parameter values are enclosed within quotes. Example configuration section for a page template:

```
url = "/blog"
layout = "default"

[component]
parameter = "value"

```
### [#](#php-code-section "Permalink")PHP code section

The code in the PHP section executes every time before the template is rendered. The PHP section is optional for all CMS templates and its contents depend on the template type where it is defined. The PHP code section can contain optional open and close PHP tags to enable syntax highlighting in text editors. The open and close tags should always be specified on a different line to the section separator `==`.

```
url = "/blog"
layout = "default"
==
<?
function onStart()
{
    $this['posts'] = ...;
}
?>
==
<h3>Blog archive</h3>
{% for post in posts %}
    <h4>{{ post.title }}</h4>
    {{ post.content }}
{% endfor %}

```

In the PHP section, you can only define functions and refer to namespaces with the PHP `use` keyword. No other PHP code is allowed in the PHP section. This is because the PHP section is converted to a PHP class when the page is parsed. Example of using a namespace reference:

```
url = "/blog"
layout = "default"
==
<?
use Acme\Blog\Classes\Post;

function onStart()
{
    $this['posts'] = Post::get();
}
?>
==

```

As a general way of setting variables, you should use the array access method on `$this`, although for simplicity you can use **object access as read-only**, for example:

```
// Write via array
$this['foo'] = 'bar';

// Read via array
echo $this['foo'];

// Read-only via object
echo $this->foo;

```
### [#](#twig-markup-section "Permalink")Twig markup section

The Twig section defines the markup to be rendered by the template. In the Twig section, you can use functions, tags, and filters [provided by Winter](../markup), all the [native Twig features](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/), or those [provided by plugins](../plugin/registration#extending-twig). The content of the Twig section depends on the template type (page, layout, or partial). You can find more information about specific Twig objects further in the documentation.

More information can be found [in the Markup guide](../markup).

## [#](#theme-logging "Permalink")Theme Logging

Winter CMS comes with a very useful feature, disabled by default, called Theme Logging.

Since layouts and pages store most of the data in flat files, it's possible for you or your clients to accidentally lose content. For example, switching the layout of a page will modify the scaffold of the page, and, as such, will result in data loss.

To enable Theme Logging, simply go to **Settings -> Log settings** and enable **Log theme changes**. All changes are now logged.

The theme changelog can be viewed at **Settings -> Theme log**. Each change has an overview of what has been added/removed, along with a copy of the changed file before and after. You can use this information to decide the appropriate action, to aid the reversion of these changes, if necessary.

## [#](#database-driven-themes "Permalink")Database Driven Themes

Winter CMS comes with another very useful feature, disabled by default, called Database Driven Themes. When this feature is enabled (by setting `cms.databaseTemplates` to `true`, or `null` when `app.debug` is `false`); the database layer stores all modified CMS files in the database. Files that are not modified continue to be loaded from the filesystem. There is a [`theme:sync $themeDir`](../console/theme-management#synchronise-database-templates) console command that can be used to sync changes between the filesystem and database.

Files modified in the database are cached to indicate that they should be loaded from the database.

> **NOTE:** All CMS template objects (ex. `Layout`, `Page`, `Content`, `Partial`, `Meta`, etc) are stored in the database when this feature is enabled and a change is made to the template in question; however theme asset files will **not** be.
