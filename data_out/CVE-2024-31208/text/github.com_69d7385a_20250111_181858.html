# Weakness in auth chain indexing allows DoS from remote room members through disk fill and high CPU usage

High

[erikjohnston](/erikjohnston)
published
GHSA-3h7q-rfh9-xm4v
Apr 23, 2024

## Package

pip

matrix-synapse
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 1.105.1

## Patched versions

1.105.1

## Description

### Impact

A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in how the auth chain cover index is calculated. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service.

Servers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected.

### Patches

Server administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later.

### Workarounds

One can:

* ban the malicious users or ACL block servers from the rooms; and/or
* leave the room and purge the room using the admin API

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at security AT element.io.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-31208

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
