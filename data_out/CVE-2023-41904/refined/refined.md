- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) in ADManager Plus versions 7202 and older, allowing REST APIs to be accessed without proper 2FA verification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to generate authentication tokens (AuthTokens) for REST API requests without requiring 2FA.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The generation of AuthTokens without 2FA allows unauthorized access to REST APIs, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can leverage the REST APIs to generate AuthTokens without completing 2FA, thereby bypassing security controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need network access to the ADManager Plus instance and knowledge of how to generate AuthTokens via the REST API. The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the REST API.
