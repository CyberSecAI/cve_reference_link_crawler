The provided content relates to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in idccms V1.35.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to prevent unauthorized requests. Specifically, the `infoMove_deal.php` endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/infoMove_deal.php?mudi=add&nohrefStr=close` is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation on the application. In this case, the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) targets adding data related to logo links.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a malicious web page containing a form that automatically submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint. This form can be embedded within a website or sent via a link to a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious web page. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, only the victim needs to have an active session on the vulnerable application.
