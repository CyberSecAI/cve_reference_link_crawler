- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `frmL7ImForm` function of the Tenda FH1206 router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a string, copying the user-supplied `page` parameter into a fixed-size buffer `v10` without proper bounds checking. The function constructs a new string using user-controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By providing an overly long `page` parameter in a POST request, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, leading to potential control of execution flow and potentially arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/L7Im` endpoint, including an overly long string as the value for the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the router. This usually requires being on the same network as the router or having access through a port forward or similar configuration.
