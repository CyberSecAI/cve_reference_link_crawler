Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22922:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a **hardcoded login credential** within the `Visitor Management System` code of `projectworlds`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is **Broken Authentication**. The SQL query used for authentication uses hardcoded credentials (`userName = 'shreya' AND pass= 'shreya'`) instead of validating user input against the database.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the web application, regardless of the credentials entered in the login form.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the login form of the `Visitor Management System`. An attacker can simply enter any arbitrary username and password into the login form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs to access the login page of the application. No prior access or special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet (from the github.com content):

```sql
$sql = "SELECT userName FROM login_info WHERE userName = 'shreya' AND pass= 'shreya' ";
$match = mysqli_query($link, $sql);
$count = mysqli_num_rows($match);
```

The SQL query always checks for the hardcoded username `'shreya'` and password `'shreya'`, ignoring any values provided by the user via the login form.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in `projectworlds' Visitor Management System`.
* The content from projectworlds.com lists a variety of projects, and the vulnerability seems to be specific to the Visitor Management System.
* The github content provides a good description of the vulnerability and includes the vulnerable code snippet.
* The content from visitor.com is unrelated to the CVE.

**Summary:**

The provided information clearly describes a broken authentication vulnerability (CVE-2024-22922) in the projectworld's Visitor Management System, caused by hardcoded login credentials in the SQL query used for authentication. This allows any attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access by providing arbitrary credentials at the login form.
