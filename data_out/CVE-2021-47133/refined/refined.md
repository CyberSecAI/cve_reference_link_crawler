The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47133.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the `amd_sfh` driver. Specifically, the `request_list` entry (`req_node`) is not freed after it has been processed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is a memory leak, caused by failing to deallocate memory allocated for the `request_list` entry within the `amd_sfh_work` function of the `amd_sfh` driver.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this memory leak is that the system will eventually run out of memory, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by the normal operation of the `amd_sfh` driver when handling HID feature reports. The leak occurs when a sensor report is processed by the `amd_sfh_work` function which obtains report data via calls to amdtp and sensor_hub functions and eventually `get_feature_report`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to trigger the processing of HID feature reports by the affected driver, which is typically part of the normal driver loading process. The attacker would need the ability to load/unload kernel modules or trigger the functionality of the amd-sfh driver.
