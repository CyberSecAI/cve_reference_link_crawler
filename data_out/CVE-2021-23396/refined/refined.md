The provided content is related to CVE-2021-23396.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `lutils` package is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to an unsafe recursive merge function in its main `merge` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe recursive merge: The `merge` function does not properly handle the `__proto__` property, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object` by injecting malicious properties.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, the application can crash or behave erratically, causing a denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): In specific cases where the application evaluates properties from objects, an attacker could inject malicious code and achieve RCE.
- Property injection: An attacker can manipulate application logic by injecting properties that the code relies on, such as privilege checks or security tokens.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through network requests if the attacker can control the input to the `merge` function.
- The attack does not require user interaction and can be performed remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input of the `merge` function, specifically by providing a malicious object containing a `__proto__` property.
- No privileges are required to perform the attack.
