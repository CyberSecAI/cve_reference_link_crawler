Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-6937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks within wolfSSL before version 5.6.6. Specifically, the library did not verify that messages contained within a single (D)TLS record did not span key boundaries. This allowed for the possibility of combining (D)TLS messages that used different keys into a single (D)TLS record.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper message handling and boundary checks within the (D)TLS record processing.
- Vulnerability to combining messages that should be segregated by key boundaries.
- In TLS 1.3, it could allow for an unencrypted ServerHello and the subsequent first server flight to be accepted by a client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential acceptance of unencrypted handshake messages when they should be encrypted.
- In the most extreme case with TLS 1.3, an unencrypted server flight could be accepted, potentially exposing initial handshake data.
- Although the vulnerability does not compromise key negotiation or authentication, it could lead to a less secure connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious server can craft a (D)TLS record that combines messages from different key contexts.
- In TLS 1.3, a server can send an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record containing the ServerHello and the rest of the first server flight.
- The attacker is required to be in a position to modify or create (D)TLS messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a malicious server, crafting specific (D)TLS messages.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted messages that combine data that should be encrypted.
- For TLS 1.3, the attacker needs to control the server side to send a malformed record containing the ServerHello and subsequent data unencrypted.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity as it does not compromise key negotiation or authentication.
- The fix for the vulnerability is available in wolfSSL version 5.6.6 and later.
- The fix was implemented in GitHub Pull Request #7029.
- A build option `WOLFSSL_DISABLE_EARLY_SANITY_CHECKS` was added to allow disabling this check.
