The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47964.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Heap-Based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute code remotely in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could manipulate a user to visit a malicious page or file, which then triggers the buffer overflow when processing user-supplied data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with a malicious file or webpage. This suggests a local attack vector, requiring a user to be compromised on the targeted system or the ability to manipulate an insider user.
