Subject: Fwd: [Security-announce][CVE-2024-5642] Buffer over-read in
 SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() for Python 3.9 and earlier

Note that in versions of Python that still had NPN support, whether NPN support
is built depends on which SSL library/version you build with:

Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-5642] Buffer over-read in
SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() for Python 3.9 and earlier
Date: 	Thu, 27 Jun 2024 16:09:13 -0500
From: 	Seth Larson <seth@...hon.org>
Reply-To: 	security-sig@...hon.org
To: 	security-announce@...hon.org

There is a buffer over-read defect in CPython 3.9 and earlier due to not
excluding an invalid value for OpenSSL's NPN APIs.

This vulnerability is of severity *LOW*.

CPython doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]") for
SSLContext.set_npn_protocols() which is an invalid value for the underlying
OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see
CVE-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN
being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon
in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).

Suggested mitigation is one of the following:

* Upgrade to Python 3.10 or later where NPN isn't supported
* Avoid using NPN via SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()
* Avoid providing an empty list as a parameter to SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()

| Bug reportBug description: OpenSSL prior to 3.3.2 had a defect in `SSL_select_next_proto` where invalid values (such as an empty list) would cause a buffer overread (see [CVE-2024-5535](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt)). The issue can be fixed in CPython by not calling `SSL_select_next_proto` with an invalid value.  This is a low severity vulnerability in CPython and is tracked separately in [CVE-2024-5642](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrvr-7x5w-xpmq "CVE-2024-5642").

| CPython 3.7 to 3.9 are only affected when using OpenSSL < 1.1.1, since CPython >= 3.7 did already drop NPN support with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1 (by accident? see [29eab55](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/29eab55309b9f78b79074d26db16a44e7841c639) and [9617741](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/961774184eb950e2547ab0d42653439adc735924)).  CPython 3.8 was released a year after OpenSSL 1.1.1, which makes it unlikely that the vulnerable combination of CPython >= 3.8 and OpenSSL < 1.1.1 would be common.  For Python3 < 3.7 in Debian ELTS I did the big hammer  ``` -# define HAVE_NPN 1 +# define HAVE_NPN 0  ```  which might also be a reasonable approach for you for the rare affected setups with 3.8 or 3.9? |

# CVE-2024-5535: `SSL\_select\_next\_proto` buffer overread celebrating a decade of publishing your heap over the internet

Since 2011, a bug has existed in OpenSSL that means innocuous code like:

```
require('tls').connect({port: 443, NPNProtocols: new Uint8Array()}, function(c) {})

```

or (equivalently, in Python):

```
import ssl, socket
assert ssl.HAS_NPN

ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.set_npn_protocols([])
ctx.load_verify_locations('root.crt')
sock = socket.create_connection(('127.0.0.1', 443))
sock = ctx.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname='localhost')
sock.write('hello')

```

**Silently sends up to 255 bytes of the client’s heap to the server**. The server
must support [NPN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg-04), and the heap data is encrypted in transit.

This is confirmed to affect Python <= 3.9 and Node <= 9. It may equally
affect any program that calls `SSL_select_next_proto` with a `client`
buffer that is not a valid list of protocols (this includes an empty buffer).

Meeting those constraints is quite unlikely nowadays:

* NPN is a precursor to ALPN and was abandoned in 2012. It is very uncommon on internet servers now.
* Node.js 10 and later removed NPN support, and is well past end-of-life.
* Python 3.10 and later removed NPN support.

However, they *were* much more common in the lifetime of this bug. **You should review your historic usage**
of `SSL_select_next_proto` and if you could have ever triggered this bug, I would suggest rolling any
secrets available to affected programs.

Android was affected [up until 2014](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/%2B/9c5e545bc78132ee8d27fd77ccaea6d3a6090ac0%5E%21/), with the heap leak behaviour
observed [independently by an okhttp developer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/437#issuecomment-35860090).

# Affected versions

* All versions of OpenSSL 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 3.x.
* BoringSSL was also affected, and [have already landed their fix](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/%2B/c1d9ac02514a138129872a036e3f8a1074dcb8bd).
* LibreSSL retains the faulty `SSL_select_next_proto`, however NPN support was removed in 2017
  so is not meaningfully broken.

# Timeline

* **2011-11-13** - Bug introduced.
* **2014-04-10** - Work-around for bug added to Android after discovery by okhttp developer.
* **2024-04-23** - Discovery of `SSL_select_next_proto` memory unsafety while [rewriting it in rust](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-openssl-compat/tree/main/rustls-libssl).
* **2024-05-02** - Discovery that Python 3.9 was practically affected
* **2024-05-02** - Report to OpenSSL project
* **2024-05-08** - Chase-up
* **2024-05-08** - Acknowledgement from OpenSSL project
* **2024-05-22** - Report to BoringSSL
* **2024-05-23** - Discovery that Node.js 9 was practically affected
* **2024-05-30** - Assigned CVE-2024-5535 and assessed as “Low” severity
* **2024-05-31** - Reported to security@python.org by David Benjamin
* **2024-06-04** - Python security confirm “Low” severity
* **2024-06-25** - In preparing this blog post, discovery that Android was affected until 2014.
* **2024-06-27** - [Advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt) released.
* **2024-11-08** - Google VRP rewards $500.

# Conclusions

* The various audits, code reviews, static analysis, dynamic analysis, fuzzing,
  and popularity were not sufficient to remedy this bug earlier.

  Though valgrind immediately points it out once triggered, and a really basic
  static pointer bounds analysis should also find it (though likely with a huge
  false-positive rate in other code.)
* The known exposures to this bug (Python, Node, Android) are probably not all
  of them, but most likely will be historic.

# Acknowledgements

* This discovery was made in the course of building [rustls-libssl](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-openssl-compat/tree/main/rustls-libssl): this work
  was funded by [ISRG Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/).
* Thanks to [Daniel McCarney](https://github.com/cpu) for pointing out the divergence in our `SSL_select_next_proto`.
* Thanks to Rich Salz @ Akamai for advice on communications with the OpenSSL project.
* Thanks to David Benjamin @ Google for advice and analysis, and taking care of the report to Python.

# Report[1](#fn:1)

`SSL_select_next_proto` called with `client_len == 0` unconditionally reads
`client[0]` and returns the pointer `client + 1`. Thereafter, `*out` points
outside a valid address, and `*outlen` contains an undefined value.

Minimal reproducer:

```
#include <openssl/ssl.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  uint8_t client_input[] = {};
  uint8_t *output = NULL;
  uint8_t output_len = 0;
  const uint8_t server_input[] = {2, 'h', '2'};

  int ret = SSL_select_next_proto(&output, &output_len, server_input,
                                  sizeof(server_input), client_input, 0);
  printf("ret = %d\n", ret);
  printf("output = %p\n", output);
  printf("output_len = %u\n", (unsigned)output_len);
  return 0;
}

```
# Impact

`SSL_select_next_proto` is a normal API function so the parameters passed
to it are ultimately up to the application. However it is almost always used inside
an ALPN or NPN callback:

If `SSL_select_next_proto` is used straightforwardly in a server’s ALPN callback,
there is no impact because other code in openssl validates the client’s extension as being
non-empty.

If `SSL_select_next_proto` is used straightforwardly in a client’s NPN callback,
the client data and its length is typically a matter of local configuration and
not under openssl’s control. Most importantly, the impact of the wrong length and
pointer being returned from this function is a catastrophic memory safety failure:
the memory is copied, placed into the `selected_protocol` field of the
`NextProtocolNegotiationEncryptedExtension` and sent to the peer!

As a realistic demonstration, in python3.9[2](#fn:2) the following code sees OpenSSL
send a chunk of heap to the server:

```
import ssl, socket
assert ssl.HAS_NPN

ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.set_npn_protocols([])
ctx.load_verify_locations('root.crt')

sock = socket.create_connection(('127.0.0.1', 443))
sock = ctx.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname='localhost')
sock.write('hello')

```

The peer receives (for example):

```
NextProtocolNegotiationEncryptedExtension {
  selected_protocol: c2d60ba35f00000000000000000000000000000000000031000000000000000
                     00000000000000060f3030d5e7f0000e0f5b9f1a65f00002006aaf1a65f0000
                     d04b0f0d5e7f0000210000000000000000f6b9f1a65f000030f6b9f1a65f000
                     0d0ebb9f1a65f00003100000000000000,
  padding: 000000000000000000000000000000,
}

```

2. later versions of python have dropped NPN support. [↩](#fnref:2)

There is a buffer over-read defect in CPython 3.9 and earlier due to not
excluding an invalid value for OpenSSL's NPN APIs.

This vulnerability is of severity *\*LOW\**.

CPython doesn't disallow configuring an empty list ("[]") for
SSLContext.set\_npn\_protocols() which is an invalid value for the underlying
OpenSSL API. This results in a buffer over-read when NPN is used (see CVE
-2024-5535 for OpenSSL). This vulnerability is of low severity due to NPN
being not widely used and specifying an empty list likely being uncommon
in-practice (typically a protocol name would be configured).

Suggested mitigation is one of the following:

* Upgrade to Python 3.10 or later where NPN isn't supported
* Avoid using NPN via SSLContext.set\_npn\_protocols()
* Avoid providing an empty list as a parameter to
  SSLContext.set\_npn\_protocols()
