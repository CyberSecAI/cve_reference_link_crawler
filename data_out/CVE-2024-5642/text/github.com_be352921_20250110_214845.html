| Bug reportBug description: OpenSSL prior to 3.3.2 had a defect in `SSL_select_next_proto` where invalid values (such as an empty list) would cause a buffer overread (see [CVE-2024-5535](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt)). The issue can be fixed in CPython by not calling `SSL_select_next_proto` with an invalid value.  This is a low severity vulnerability in CPython and is tracked separately in [CVE-2024-5642](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrvr-7x5w-xpmq "CVE-2024-5642"). CPython 3.10 and beyond removed support for NPN and thus aren't affected by this issue. CPython versions tested on: 3.8, 3.9 Operating systems tested on: *No response* |

| CPython 3.7 to 3.9 are only affected when using OpenSSL < 1.1.1, since CPython >= 3.7 did already drop NPN support with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1 (by accident? see [29eab55](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/29eab55309b9f78b79074d26db16a44e7841c639) and [9617741](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/961774184eb950e2547ab0d42653439adc735924)).  CPython 3.8 was released a year after OpenSSL 1.1.1, which makes it unlikely that the vulnerable combination of CPython >= 3.8 and OpenSSL < 1.1.1 would be common.  For Python3 < 3.7 in Debian ELTS I did the big hammer  ``` -# define HAVE_NPN 1 +# define HAVE_NPN 0  ```  which might also be a reasonable approach for you for the rare affected setups with 3.8 or 3.9? |
