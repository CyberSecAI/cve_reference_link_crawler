Package        : xfpt
Version        : 0.11-1+deb11u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-43700

An issue has been found in xfpt, a tool to generate XML from plain tex.

```
The issue is about bad handling of input data, which may result in a
stack-based buffer overflow and execution of arbitrary code, when
processing specially crafted files.
```

```
For Debian 11 bullseye, this problem has been fixed in version
0.11-1+deb11u1.
```

We recommend that you upgrade your xfpt packages.

For the detailed security status of xfpt please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xfpt>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# The xfpt plain text to XML processor

xfpt is a program that converts a marked up source document coded in UTF-8 into
an XML document. It was written with DocBook XML in mind, but can also be used
to create other forms of XML. Unlike some other processors, xfpt does not try
to produce XML from input that is also usable as a freestanding document. This
makes it less ambiguous for large and/or complicated documents. xfpt is aimed
at users who understand the XML that they are generating. It makes it easy to
include literal XML, either in blocks, or within paragraphs. xfpt restricts
itself to two special characters that trigger all its processing. You can read
the [xfpt manual](https://github.com/PhilipHazel/xfpt/blob/main/doc/xfpt.pdf) on
this GitHub site.
