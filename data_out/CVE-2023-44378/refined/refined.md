{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The comparison methods `frontend.API.Cmp` and `frontend.API.IsLess` used binary decomposition and checked the bitwise differences. For some in-circuit values, it was possible to construct two valid decompositions to bits due to overflowing the field where the values are defined. This allows a malicious prover to construct a valid proof for a statement `a < b` even if `a > b`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsoundness in variable comparison",
      "Non-unique binary decomposition"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious prover can construct a valid proof for a statement `a < b` even if `a > b`. This breaks the integrity of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting specific inputs that cause the binary decomposition to be non-unique, leading to incorrect comparison results.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to provide inputs to the circuit and generate proofs.",
     "cve_id": "CVE-2023-44378"
  },
  "fix": {
    "description": "The fix adds an additional comparison of the decomposed bit-vector to the modulus of the in-circuit values, ensuring the binary decomposition is unique.",
