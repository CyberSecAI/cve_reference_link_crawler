WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Desigo PXG3.Wx00-y - Desigo BACnet/IP Web Interface with standard or extended functionality These
devices have a web server that processes data from various Desigo automation stations and other devices
based on BACnet IP to HTML5 web pages. They are used as an interface for web-based, graphical
operation of BACnet automation stations using Desigo touch panels and devices with an HTML 5.0 web
browser. The web interfaces PXG3.W100-1/2 and PXG3.W200-1/2 are the central points of access to
operate the automation level and room automation.

Desigo PXMxx-1 - Desigo Control Point with embedded web browser. These high quality touch panels
are used for technical on-site operation of plants as well as room operation. They are optimized for local
on-site operation of the Desigo building automation and control system. These touch panels have an

embedded web browser that is used for communicating with HTML5.0 capable web servers and utilizes
TCP/IP communication.

Desigo PXMxx.E - Desigo Control Point with integrated web server. These high quality touch panels are
used for technical on-site operation of plants as well as room operation. They are optimized for local
on-site operation of the Desigo building automation and control system. These touch panels have an
integrated web server and utilizes BACnet/IP communication.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40176

There exists an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command with root
privileges during a restore operation due to the missing validation of the names of ﬁles included in
the input package. By restoring a speciﬁcally crafted package, a remote low-privileged attacker can
execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the device, leading to a full compromise.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40177

Endpoints of the “Operation” web application that interpret and execute Axon language queries allow
ﬁle read access to the device ﬁle system with root privileges. By supplying speciﬁc I/O related Axon
queries, a remote low-privileged attacker can read sensitive ﬁles on the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40178

Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation exists in the “Import Files“ functionality
of the “Operation” web application, due to the missing validation of the titles of ﬁles included in the
input package. By uploading a speciﬁcally crafted graphics package, a remote low-privileged attacker
can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40179

A Cross-Site Request Forgery exists in endpoints of the “Operation” web application that interpret
and execute Axon language queries, due to the missing validation of anti-CSRF tokens or other origin
checks. By convincing a victim to click on a malicious link or visit a speciﬁcally crafted webpage while
logged-in to the device web application, a remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary Axon
queries against the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40180

A Cross-Site Request Forgery exists in the “Import Files“ functionality of the “Operation” web applica-
tion due to the missing validation of anti-CSRF tokens or other origin checks. A remote unauthenticated
attacker can upload and enable permanent arbitrary JavaScript code into the device just by convincing
a victim to visit a speciﬁcally crafted webpage while logged-in to the device web application.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-40181

The device embedded browser does not prevent interaction with alternative URI schemes when
redirected to corresponding resources by web application code. By setting the homepage URI, the
favorite URIs, or redirecting embedded browser users via JavaScript code to alternative scheme
resources, a remote low privileged attacker can perform a range of attacks against the device, such as
read arbitrary ﬁles on the ﬁlesystem, execute arbitrary JavaScript code in order to steal or manipulate
the information on the screen, or trigger denial of service conditions.
