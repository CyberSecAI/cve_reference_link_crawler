Prevent insertion in other users storage volumesDon't allow file insertion in other users storage volumes.This was already handled if DATA was explicitly set in content values,but was allowed if DATA was generated based on other values like RELATIVE\_PATH and DISPLAY\_NAME.Insertion of files in other users storage volumes can be used by malicious appsto get access to other users files, since the same file would exist in both users MP databaseswhich would lead to MP falsely assuming that the user has access to this file.Bug: 294406604Test: atest MediaProviderTests(cherry picked from https://googleplex-android-review.googlesource.com/q/commit:df39f8486b25473d0bdbeed896ad917e3c793bf9)Merged-In: Ie219bbdbe28819421040e4c083b65ab47d8ebde6Change-Id: Ie219bbdbe28819421040e4c083b65ab47d8ebde6
