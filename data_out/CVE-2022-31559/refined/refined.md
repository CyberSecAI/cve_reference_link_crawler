In all cases, the core issue is the insecure usage of the `flask.send_file` function, which allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, potentially leading to unauthorized access to files on the server. The suggested remediation is to avoid passing untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function or use `flask.safe_join` for sanitizing paths or to use `flask.send_from_directory` instead to restrict access to a specific directory.

The CVSS score for all of the identified CVEs is 9.3 with exception to CVE-2022-31514 and CVE-2022-31588 which are 9.3, and CVE-2022-31566 which has a score of 8.6. A score of 9.8 is assigned to CVE-2022-31570. These high scores indicate that these vulnerabilities are considered critical due to their potential impact on confidentiality, and the ease with which they can be exploited.
