Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2023-52910.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `__alloc_and_insert_iova_range` function within the IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) subsystem. Specifically, the `retry_pfn` variable, which is calculated as `curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1`, can overflow when `iovad->cached_node` is `iovad->anchor` and `iovad->anchor.pfn_hi` is `~0UL`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The `retry_pfn` calculation can result in an overflow, leading to an incorrect value.
- Logic error: The retry logic incorrectly updates `low_pfn` to 0, causing the subsequent allocation to succeed even when it shouldn't.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful allocation of IOVA (I/O Virtual Address) that exceeds the allowed domain size.
- Potential memory corruption or other undefined behavior due to incorrect IOVA allocation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering IOVA allocation requests in a specific manner.
- Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in two scenarios:
    1. Allocating an IOVA size that exceeds the domain size during initialization.
    2. Deleting the node with the largest `iova->pfn_lo` value in the IOVA domain, causing `iovad->cached_node` to be updated to `iovad->anchor`, then trying to allocate an IOVA size that exceeds maximum allocatable size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger IOVA allocation requests with a size exceeding the domain size under certain conditions, or cause the conditions described in scenario 2. This typically requires privileged access.

**More Details:**
The provided information includes the specific code diffs that fix the issue by modifying the retry logic, where instead of `retry_pfn = curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1;` it is changed to `retry_pfn = curr_iova->pfn_hi;`, and also changing `low_pfn = retry_pfn` to `low_pfn = retry_pfn + 1;` in the retry block.
The description provides two specific scenarios in which the bug manifests itself, also including an example log of the first case.
