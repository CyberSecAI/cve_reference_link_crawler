| Can you do the work to allocate the CVE number and document which version it was fixed in (2.4.12.0 for this one, and the upcoming 2.4.13.0 for the other ICO related one), or must it be the project administrator who submits the request? |

| Yeah, redhat needs your consent (in the form of comment on issue link itself)  Here's what redhat sent me back:  \_Hello,  Could you please get an upstream's acknowledgement for CVE assignment (in the form of comment on issue link itself) and provide us the reference? We need upstream's consent before we proceed with the CVE assignment.  Thank you!\_ |

| Sorry for the confusion, it took me a while to understand precisely what you needed from me to move the process along. I will do the same on the other issue. |

| That’s all right. The process of applying for CVE can be complicated at times, and I was confused at first, too |

| Probably the safest thing is to assume that the problem exists in all versions prior to 2.4.12.0 when it was definitively fixed.  But it's very possible that there was an earlier point where the problem was first introduced into the code, and that prior versions do not have the problem. But since we're now talking about multiple major versions older than we currently maintain or test, it would be a lot of work to figure out if that was the case. I'm not even sure if those old versions would build on today's toolchain without some some effort and maybe re-installing old compilers, etc. |
