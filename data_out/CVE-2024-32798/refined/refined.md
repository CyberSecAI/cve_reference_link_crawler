- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a function lacking proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user.
