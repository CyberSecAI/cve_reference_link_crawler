- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Contact Form by Supsystic plugin, in versions 1.7.27 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could force a higher-privileged user to perform unwanted actions on the website while they are authenticated. The specific impact depends on the actions the plugin allows to be performed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. This forces their browser to send a request to the vulnerable website, performing an action without the user's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user (with sufficient permissions to perform the desired action) into visiting a malicious link or site. They do not need to be authenticated on the target site.
