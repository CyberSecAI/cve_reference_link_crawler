  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    The vulnerability is caused by the `admin_config_mark.php` script directly concatenating and writing user-provided input data into `inc_photowatermark_config.php` without proper sanitization. Specifically, the code uses `str_replace` to remove single quotes and `addslashes` to escape special characters. However, these measures can be bypassed using specific payloads.

  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Code injection: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the configuration file. The `str_replace` and `addslashes` functions fail to prevent a carefully crafted injection.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): The injected code can then be executed, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.

  - Impact of exploitation:
    - Complete system compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, or destruction.
    - Full control of the web application: The attacker can gain full control over the web application, allowing them to manipulate data, create new admin accounts, or use the compromised system as a staging ground for further attacks.

  - Attack vectors:
    - HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `admin_config_mark.php` script.
    - Malicious payload in form data: The malicious code is injected through the `photo_watertext` and `photo_fontsize` parameters in the POST request. The payload uses the single quote bypass to inject PHP code that can then be executed.

  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Authenticated access: The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator on the web application to access the vulnerable `admin_config_mark.php` script.
    - Ability to send POST requests: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with crafted form data.
