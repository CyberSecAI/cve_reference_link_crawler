SeaCMS 12.9 has a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by admin_config_mark.php directly splicing and writing the user input data into inc_photowatermark_config.php without processing it, which allows authenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands and obtain system permissions.
