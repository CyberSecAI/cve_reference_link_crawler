This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [CollabNet Plugins
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/collabnet)

## Descriptions

### Improper masking of credentials in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-2796
/
CVE-2022-38663**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Git Plugin 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.
Usernames are masked instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as secret.

Git Plugin 4.11.5 properly masks credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.
As a side effect of the fix, usernames currently set to be not masked will lose their current (unintentional) masking.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Job Configuration History Plugin

**SECURITY-2765
/
CVE-2022-38664**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`jobConfigHistory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jobConfigHistory)**

**Description:**

Job Configuration History Plugin 1165.v8cc9fd1f4597 and earlier does not escape the job name on the System Configuration History page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure job names.

Job Configuration History Plugin 1166.vc9f255f45b\_8a escapes the job name on the System Configuration History page.

### RabbitMQ password stored in plain text by CollabNet Plugins Plugin

**SECURITY-2157
/
CVE-2022-38665**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`collabnet`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/collabnet)**

**Description:**

CollabNet Plugins Plugin 2.0.8 and earlier stores a RabbitMQ password unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.collabnet.share.TeamForgeShare.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

CollabNet Plugins Plugin 2.0.9 no longer includes the EventQ feature that accepts RabbitMQ credentials.
The RabbitMQ password will be removed from the configuration file once it is saved again.

### RCE vulnerability in Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin

**SECURITY-2448
/
CVE-2021-25738**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`kubernetes-cd`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes-cd)**

**Description:**

Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin 2.3.1 and earlier bundles a version of Kubernetes Java Client library with the vulnerability [CVE-2021-25738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25738) that does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin’s build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Severity

* SECURITY-2157:
  [Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
* SECURITY-2448:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* SECURITY-2765:
