The content is related to CVE-2024-21870.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the OAS Engine's handling of file paths and names in the "File Data Source" configuration for Tags. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the provided path and filename, leading to arbitrary file creation or overwrite.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path. The application allows user-controlled input to specify the file path and name, allowing for writing to arbitrary locations.
- Unrestricted file write vulnerability due to insecure file handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file creation or overwrite leading to potential data loss, system instability or further attacks depending on the overwritten file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network requests to the OAS Engine using specially crafted protobuf messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user access to the OAS Engine, as the file path modification and tag configuration require authentication.
- Ability to send specially crafted network requests to modify `File Data Source` configurations and configure a `Tag` to use a file as its data source.
