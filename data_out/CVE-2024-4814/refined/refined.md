Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection in the `static_route_edit_commit.php` file of Ruijie RG-UAC devices. Specifically, the `oldipmask/oldgateway` parameters are not properly sanitized when constructing an OS command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The application constructs an OS command using externally-influenced input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality: An attacker could potentially access sensitive information on the device.
- Integrity: An attacker could modify the device's configuration or data.
- Availability: An attacker could cause denial of service by disrupting the device's functionality.
- Full control of server permissions through arbitrary command execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack is launched by manipulating the `oldipmask/oldgateway` parameters in the `static_route_edit_commit.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `static_route_edit_commit.php` interface of the Ruijie RG-UAC device.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Ruijie RG-UAC up to version 20240506.
- A public exploit is available, and the exploitation is considered easy.
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available on GitHub.
- The vulnerability can be found through Google Hacking using the search term `inurl:view/networkConfig/RouteConfig/StaticRoute/static_route_edit_commit.php`.
