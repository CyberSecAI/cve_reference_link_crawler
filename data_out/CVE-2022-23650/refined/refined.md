Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-23650

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Netmaker codebase. This key was used for JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, which is used to manage sessions and permissions within the Netmaker system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded cryptographic key:** The primary weakness is the presence of the static key `(BytesOverTheWire)` used for signing JWTs. This key was present in the `logic/jwts.go` file.
- **Predictable Key:** The initial implementation used a static, predictable key which is a major security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded key could forge valid JWTs, allowing them to bypass authentication and impersonate any user, including administrators.
- **Admin Command Execution:** This would grant attackers the ability to execute administrative commands on the remote server.
- **Complete Control:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the Netmaker server, enabling data breaches, service disruption, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the Netmaker server.
- **Admin User Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the username of an admin to be able to craft a valid admin JWT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Netmaker server.
- **Knowledge of the Hard-coded Key:** Access to the source code or reverse engineering could reveal the key if it was not already known.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the Netmaker server component, not the clients.
- The fix involves generating and storing a random JWT secret key at server startup.
- Patched versions are v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0+.
- The fix was implemented by replacing the static `jwtSecretKey` with a randomly generated key, stored in the database.
