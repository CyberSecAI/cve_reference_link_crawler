# Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

High

[afeiszli](/afeiszli)
published
GHSA-86f3-hf24-76q4
Feb 18, 2022

## Package

gomod

netmaker
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

(all)

## Patched versions

v0.8.5,v0.9.4,v0.10.0+

## Description

### Impact

There is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server, if you know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients.

### Patches

This has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. If you are running these versions, the fix is to perform the following:

1. docker-compose down
2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:( version )
3. docker-compose up -d

#### Additional Information

If you are running **any other version**, you will need to upgrade to one of these three versions. If you have a special circumstance that requires running a different version, let us know and we may be able to build a custom patch.
