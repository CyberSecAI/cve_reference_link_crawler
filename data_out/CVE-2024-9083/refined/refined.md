Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization in the `add-admin.php` file of the SourceCodester Employee Management System 1.0. Specifically, the `txtfullname` parameter is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a persistent (stored) XSS vulnerability because the injected script is stored in the application's database or data store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the vulnerable field (`txtfullname`). When the application displays the attacker-controlled content on a user's browser, the malicious scripts will execute.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers may steal cookies to perform actions as a valid user
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers may modify data within the application.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers may redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers may deface the application's user interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the Employee Management System, specifically the `add-admin.php` page.
*   **txtfullname Parameter:**  The attacker injects malicious payload into `txtfullname` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the vulnerable page:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `add-admin.php` page of the application.
*   **Ability to submit data:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the form on `add-admin.php` page and submit data to the vulnerable `txtfullname` field.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs because the application fails to sanitize the data entered into the `txtfullname` field before displaying it on other pages such as the Admin Record page. The provided Proof of Concept shows how injecting the payload "</div>" in the `txtfullname` field leads to an alert on the "Admin Record" page, demonstrating the stored XSS.
* The application appears to store the unsanitized input and renders it later, resulting in the injected script being executed in the context of the user's browser.
