The provided content describes a path traversal vulnerability in multiple Python Flask applications, stemming from the insecure use of `flask.send_file` and `os.path.join`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Passing untrusted, attacker-controlled input to `flask.send_file` without proper sanitization or validation.
- Using `os.path.join` with attacker-controlled input, which can be bypassed with absolute paths, leading to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability due to insecure handling of file paths.
- Improper use of `flask.send_file`, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
- Unsafe use of `os.path.join` which can be circumvented via absolute paths

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, including application source code, configuration files, and potentially sensitive system files.
- Potential for information disclosure (passwords, credentials, secrets).
- Possible partial denial-of-service if an attacker makes multiple requests for large files.
- Depending on the context, it may also be used to gain access to local files

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `filename` or `path` parameters of download requests with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths.
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require any special user privileges on the target system.
