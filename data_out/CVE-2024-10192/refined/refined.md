Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10192

**Description:**
The vulnerability exists in the PHPGurukul IFSC Code Finder Project 1.0, specifically in the `search.php` file. It is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `searchifsccode` input.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the application's failure to sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`searchifsccode`) before displaying it on the webpage. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation):** The application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability is present because the malicious script is injected directly into the request and displayed in the response without being sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Violation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the user's browser, potentially compromising the integrity of the application and the user's session. An attacker could steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Input Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `searchifsccode` input field in `search.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into accessing it. The attacker could use techniques such as social engineering to get the user to click the malicious link.
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or access to the server itself to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The XSS payload used for testing is: `%3cIMG%20%22%22%22%3e%3cSCRIPT%3ealert(%22XSS%22)%3c%2fSCRIPT%3e%22%3e`.
- When decoded, the payload becomes: `<IMG """"><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">`.
- The application outputs this unsanitized payload, leading to the execution of the javascript alert box.
