This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using *root*-level privileges.  Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-overflow-s2r82P9v>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers:    + RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall   + RV130 VPN Router   + RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router   + RV215W Wireless-N VPN RouterDetermine the Device Configuration The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a local LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.  To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose **Basic Settings > Remote Management**. If the **Enable** check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device.
