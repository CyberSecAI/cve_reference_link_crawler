"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device using root-level privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings > Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device."
