- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input in the Anomaly Detection interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands by injecting malicious scripts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious code via a parameter of a request to the Anomaly Detection interface. The XSS occurs when the parameter name is displayed in the Tree View.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker is remote and unauthenticated, and needs to craft a malicious request to the vulnerable interface. The user must click the Tree View option for the injected payload to trigger.
