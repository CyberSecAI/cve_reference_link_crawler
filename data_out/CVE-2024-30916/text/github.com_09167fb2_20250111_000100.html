| Is there an already existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Expected behavior When setting history\_depth = 0 or max\_samples = 0 in DurabilityService QoS, return bad parameter or inform inconsistent QoS. Current behavior Despite inconsistent QoS settings, datareader, datawriter and topic are created normally. Steps to reproduce It is inconsistent if `max_samples < (max_instances * max_samples_per_instance)` . But when setting max\_instances=0 or history\_depth=0, Despite inconsistent QoS settings, datareader, datawriter and topic are created normally.  Insert the following code in HelloWorldSubscriber.cpp in HelloWorldExample.  ``` // Creating DataReader QoS like this caused error.      DataReaderQos rqos = DATAREADER_QOS_DEFAULT; 		rqos.durability_service().history_depth = 0; 		rqos.durability_service().max_samples = 0; 		 		DataWriterQos rqos = DATAWRITER_QOS_DEFAULT; 		rqos.durability_service().history_depth = 0; 		rqos.durability_service().max_samples = 0; 		 		TopicQoS tqos = TOPIC_QOS_DEFAULT; 		tqos.durability_service().history_depth = 0; 		tqos.durability_service().max_samples = 0; ``` Fast DDS version/commit `Fast-DDS v2.11.2`, but I think it's going to happen in the latest version, too Platform/Architecture Ubuntu Focal 20.04 amd64 Transport layer Default configuration, UDPv4 & SHM, Intra-process Additional context This issue is similar with [#4574](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/4574).  This is an issue in eProsima FastDDS v.2.14.0 and before allows a local attacker to obtain sensitive information via the history\_depth component.

| Hi [@mirusu400](https://github.com/mirusu400) As discussed [in this thread](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/4574#issuecomment-2018084790), these restrictions are displayed as warnings from now on until Fast DDS v3.0.0 is released. |
