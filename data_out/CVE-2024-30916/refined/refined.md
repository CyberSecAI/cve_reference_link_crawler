{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of DurabilityService QoS settings in eProsima Fast DDS. Specifically, when `history_depth` or `max_samples` are set to 0, the system incorrectly proceeds to create datareaders, datawriters, and topics instead of returning an error or warning about the inconsistent QoS. This inconsistency occurs because the resource limits were not being properly validated when set to zero or a negative value, leading to unexpected behavior.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for DurabilityService QoS parameters such as `history_depth` and `max_samples`, specifically when set to zero or negative numbers, these settings should trigger an error or warning.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could exploit this issue to potentially obtain sensitive information. Although the specific nature of the information is not detailed in this issue, the underlying inconsistency in QoS handling could lead to memory corruption or other unintended consequences that might reveal internal states or data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have some level of access to the system where Fast DDS is running to influence the QoS settings. This might involve modifying configuration files or using an API to specify inconsistent QoS settings during the initialization of data readers, data writers or topics. The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user or a local attacker with the ability to change QoS settings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to configure the DurabilityService QoS settings of Fast DDS, which implies local access or the ability to influence the application's configuration. The attacker must have the ability to create or modify DataReaders, DataWriters and Topics with the incorrect QoS settings."
