Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which appears to be related to CVE-2010-5172:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how many antivirus (AV) products use System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks within the Windows operating system. These hooks are used to intercept system calls for security monitoring.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Argument-switch attack:**  The core vulnerability is a "argument-switch" attack. This involves initially passing benign code to the AV software that bypasses its checks. Then, just before execution, the benign code is swapped out with a malicious payload. The timing of this switch is critical, but is reliably achieved on multi-core systems due to race conditions.
*   **Race Condition:** The exploit leverages a race condition in multi-core processors, where one thread is unable to accurately track actions of other concurrently running threads.
*   **SSDT Hooks:** AV software using SSDT hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks to implement security features is vulnerable.
*   **Bypassing of security checks:** The vulnerability allows malicious code to bypass the AV software's checks, even though the same code would otherwise be blocked.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Antivirus Protection:** The most significant impact is the ability to bypass the real-time scanning and protection mechanisms of AV products, allowing malware to execute undetected.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware on the system even when the system is running under an account with limited privileges.
*   **Disabling AV:**  An attacker could use this to disable installed and running AV software.
*   **Unrestricted Execution of Malicious Code:** Once the AV software is bypassed, any type of malicious code can be executed without hindrance.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local execution:** The attack requires an attacker to already have the ability to execute a binary on the target PC.
*   **Exploit chaining:** The exploit can be chained with other vulnerabilities (e.g., in Adobe Reader or Java VM) to deliver malware.
*   **Social engineering:** Could be delivered through techniques that trick users into executing code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker must already have a way to run a program on the target machine. This could be achieved through exploiting another vulnerability.
*   **Timing Precision:** Precise timing of the code switch is required to exploit the race condition.
*   **Knowledge of SSDT hooks:** An attacker would need a technical understanding of the system service descriptor table and the way antivirus products hook into it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack is described as requiring "a large amount of code" to be loaded, potentially making it less suitable for shellcode-based attacks that rely on small payloads.
*   The technique is described as effective even under limited privileges, further emphasizing the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The Matousec research tested numerous AV products and found 100% of the products that used SSDT hooks or other kernel-mode hooks to be vulnerable, indicating the widespread nature of the issue.
