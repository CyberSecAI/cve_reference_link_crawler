- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A one-byte buffer overflow during HTTP header parsing. Specifically, when the length of a header value is exactly equal to the configured buffer size, a null byte is written one byte beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption. This occurs when processing header fields other than `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Host`, and `Connection`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CWE-119**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.
    - **Heap Overflow**: A one-byte heap overflow due to incorrect length checking during header processing.
    - **Arbitrary Memory Allocation**: By corrupting the heap metadata (specifically, the free list pointer), the attacker can force the next allocation to occur at an arbitrary memory address.

-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution**: By allocating an attacker-controlled address, the attacker can overwrite stack data, function pointers, or other critical areas of memory to achieve code execution.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Network Packets**: The attacker sends specially crafted network packets containing HTTP requests with malicious headers.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server.
    - **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication.
    - **Knowledge of HTTP protocol**: The attacker needs to understand HTTP header structure to craft malicious requests.
