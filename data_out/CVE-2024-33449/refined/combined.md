# Uncovering an SSRF Vulnerability in PDFMyURL Affecting Numerous Users

## A bug bounty story by GRuMPz.

While enumerating the scope of a target on a private bug bounty program, I came across a subdomain used for generating PDF files. However, it seemed out-of-scope as they were simply white labeling a service called [PDFMyURL](https://pdfmyurl.com), which lets you convert any URL or web page into a PDF.

I couldn't resist exploring the functionality to understand how their service operates. It's quite straightforward. By sending a simple POST request with a **URL** parameter and the relevant URL, the backend application will change the user-provided URL into a downloadable PDF file.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713738782918/047bd49f-6a08-4fe2-9986-60bf58d85737.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)

Given that the web application sends requests to a specific location to generate a PDF file, I started testing the application to check for Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. SSRF is a flaw that enables an attacker to make the server-side application send requests to unintended places. This could lead the server to connect to internal services that are meant to be accessed only within the organization's infrastructure.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713742099138/d915719b-db91-49fa-ad17-d5c546633e8c.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)

After testing the application for Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, I found that the security measures in place effectively blocked SSRF attacks. I attempted common bypass techniques using decimal and octal formats but was unsuccessful in my attempts.

I then tried using various IP variations within the **127.0.0.0/8 CIDR range for localhost**. In particular, I entered the URL **http://127.127.127.127** into the PDF generator. This allowed me to successfully bypass the security measures in place, enabling us to generate the PDF.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713743150290/298d8476-4576-459a-91c6-42a999ef9f88.png?auto=compress,format&format=webp)

As seen in the response section of BurpSuite in the screenshot above, our PDF was successfully generated. The title indicates **(Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works!)**, confirming our ability to access the localhost of the underlying host. The application handled our localhost payload and displayed the output in the PDF file.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714416752417/66a028b2-d532-4519-b8f3-55c82be5a0d6.jpeg?auto=compress,format&format=webp)

And there we have it. We successfully created a simple yet effective payload that bypassed the SSRF security controls in place. This allowed us to exploit a full read SSRF by using the localhost CIDR range. It's a valuable lesson for beginners in bug bounty hunting: having a solid testing approach, working through challenges, and persisting until you reach your desired outcomes.

Further investigation revealed a widespread issue affecting numerous customers and thousands of users, leading to a pending CVE.

Remember, fellow hackers, keep exploring the digital realm, and hacking the planet.
