Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-47353

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL pointer check in the `udf_symlink` function within the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `udf_symlink` function retrieves a block using `udf_tgetblk`, which in turn calls `sb_getblk`.  `sb_getblk` can return NULL if it fails to allocate a block.
- The code directly uses the returned block pointer (`epos.bh`) without checking if it is NULL, resulting in a potential NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability would lead to a kernel crash due to the NULL pointer dereference. This could result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves creating a symlink on a UDF filesystem. If the underlying block allocation fails for some reason, the `udf_symlink` function will dereference a NULL pointer, crashing the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create files and symlinks on a mounted UDF filesystem. This implies having some level of write access to the filesystem.
- The attacker must also cause a block allocation to fail on the system, which may not be trivial and may depend on various factors such as system memory and disk I/O conditions

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the value returned by `udf_tgetblk` is not NULL before dereferencing it.  Specifically it adds the following code:
```c
if (unlikely(!epos.bh)) {
    err = -ENOMEM;
    goto out_no_entry;
}
```
This check prevents the NULL pointer dereference and handles the allocation failure gracefully by returning an error.
- Multiple commits address the same underlying issue across different branches of the Linux kernel.
