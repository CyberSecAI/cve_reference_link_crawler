Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `get_wq_ctx()` function, used for resuming sleeping threads after an SMC (Secure Monitor Call), was incorrectly configured as a standard call instead of an atomic (fast) call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Non-atomic operation:** The `get_wq_ctx()` function was vulnerable to interruption. If it was interrupted and went to sleep, another SMC call could potentially attempt to allocate a wait queue context, leading to a deadlock.
- **Incorrect call configuration:** The function was set up as a standard SMC call when it required the properties of a fast/atomic call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary consequence of this vulnerability is a deadlock situation, where multiple SMC calls are blocked indefinitely, halting the system or specific processes that rely on SMC calls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multiple concurrent SMC calls:** The vulnerability can be triggered by having multiple simultaneous SMC calls that involve sleeping and resuming threads using wait queues. Specifically, the scenario involves one SMC call waking up and calling `get_wq_ctx()`, while another SMC call is waiting to allocate a wait queue context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to trigger multiple concurrent SMC calls that involve sleeping and resuming threads. This would typically require some level of access to the system and the ability to execute code that performs SMC calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changing the `get_wq_ctx()` function to use `ARM_SMCCC_FAST_CALL` instead of `ARM_SMCCC_STD_CALL`. This ensures that the call is atomic and cannot be interrupted, thus preventing the deadlock.
- The vulnerability is in the Qualcomm System Control Manager (SCM) driver within the Linux kernel.
- The patch addresses the issue by marking the function as a fast call. This change prevents the described scenario from causing a deadlock.
- The fix was backported to stable kernel branches.
