Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-2609:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The permission prompt input delay could expire while the window is not in focus. The shared enable delay helper doesn't detect that the dialog is opened inside a window that is inactive, and so the initial prompt delay expires while the popup window is obscuring the dialog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Clickjacking vulnerability due to the permission prompt input delay expiring when the window is not in focus.
- The prompt is already using the shared enable delay helper, but the delay helper doesn't detect that the dialog is opened inside a window that is inactive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious website could use clickjacking to trick a user into unintentionally granting permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a popup and initiating a protocol URI on a hidden window.
- Luring a user into clicking on a hijacked prompt using a malicious website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to open a popup window.
- Ability to initiate a protocol URI.
- Ability to create a malicious website that can overlay and obscure the prompt.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Firefox and Thunderbird.
- The fix involves preventing the enable delay from starting if the focus target's window is not the active window, which disables the prompt button if the dialog is opened in the background.
- The issue was reported by Shaheen Fazim and assigned to Gijs.
- The fix has been verified in Firefox versions 124, 125, and ESR 115.10, and Thunderbird 115.10.
