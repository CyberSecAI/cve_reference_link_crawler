**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure communication channel within the Upgrade Service of B&R Automation Studio and B&R Technology Guarding. Specifically, these services utilize insufficient cryptography for communication with upgrade and licensing servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient communication encryption, specifically regarding the use of outdated TLS versions (TLS < 1.2) for communication.
- Insecure communication channel in the Upgrade Service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A network-based attacker can intercept network traffic.
- Attackers can insert and execute arbitrary code on the affected products.
- Attackers can sniff sensitive data transmitted through the insecure channel.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks by intercepting network communication between the affected products and B&R servers.
- Emulating an upgrade server that still supports older TLS versions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- Ability to intercept and potentially alter network traffic between the affected product and the B&R servers. This could be achieved through a compromised network, a poorly configured firewall, or malware on a node within the network.
