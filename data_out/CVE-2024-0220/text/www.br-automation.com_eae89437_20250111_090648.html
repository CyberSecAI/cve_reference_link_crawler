Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular test-
ing with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasion-
ally an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product
cyber security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerabil-
ity handling process. This entails validating if the issue is in fact a product issue, identifying root causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide de-
tails on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that min-
imize the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a Cyber Security Advisory should not be mis-
construed as an affirmation or indication of an active threat or ongoing campaign targeting the
products mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the com-
munication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user commu-
nity in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust
we work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information
which is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R recommends using B&R Automation Studio >=4.6 and/or B&R Technology Guarding >= 1.4.0 at earli-
est convenience.

The process to install updates for the affected products is described in the user manual. The step to
identify the installed product version is described in the user manual.

Vulnerability severity and details

A vulnerability exists in services hosted by B&R and used by B&R Automation Studio Upgrade Service and
B&R Technology Guarding, included in the product versions listed above. A network attacker could ex-
ploit the vulnerability by intercepting the network traffic, which allows inserting and running arbitrary
code on the products and sniffing sensitive data.

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) v3.11.

CVE-2024-0220 - B&R products use insufficient communication encryption.

B&R Automation Studio Upgrade Service and B&R Technology Guarding use insufficient cryptography
for communication to the upgrade and the licensing servers. A network-based attacker could exploit the
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the products or sniff sensitive data.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score:
8.3 (High)
CVSS v3.1 Temporal Score:  7.2 (High)
CVSS v3.1 Vector:

Mitigating factors

Configure a firewall to disable support for TLS <1.2
Customers could configure a firewall to disable support for TLS <1.2 for connections to the B&R servers.
Even if the support for TLS <1.2 is disabled on the B&R server-side, a network attacker could emulate an
upgrade server that still supports these legacy TLS versions, making the vulnerability still exploitable.

Verification of B&R digitally signed upgrade files
B&R upgrade files are digitally signed, and their signatures are checked by Windows UAC before installa-
tion. However, the customers should verify the publisher certificate during the Windows UAC prompt
and not only rely on the displayed published name (Microsoft, 2023).

Additionally, refer to section “General security recommendations” for further advise on how to keep your
system secure.

1 The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in this advisory since it reflects
the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’ computing environment; end-user organizations
are therefore recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental Score.

Workarounds

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying
vulnerability, they can help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, this is
identified below as “Impact of workaround”.

If the customer wants to continue using Automation Studio < 4.6

Manual upgrade for packages
The customer would not be able to use the Upgrade Service of the B&R Automation Studio anymore.
Thus, the customer would need to download the upgrade packages manually from the B&R website.

Usage of B&R Technology Guarding
The customer must upgrade to a later version of B&R Technology Guarding and use B&R Technology
Guarding as a standalone application. Thus, the customer can only transfer their license by opening B&R
Technology Guarding as a standalone application and not through B&R Automation Studio.

How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?

A network attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by intercepting and altering the network com-
munication of an affected system node. This would require that the attacker has access to the system
network, by connecting to the network either directly or through a wrongly configured or penetrated
firewall, or that he installs malicious software on a system node or otherwise infects the network with
malicious software. Recommended practices help mitigate such attacks, see section Mitigating Factors
above.

Could the vulnerability be exploited remotely?

Yes, an attacker who has network access to an affected system node could exploit this vulnerability. Rec-
ommended practices include that process control systems are physically protected, have no direct con-
nections to the Internet, and are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a
minimal number of ports exposed.

How is the vulnerability solved?

The B&R server has disabled an insecure communication channel by only allowing HTTPS communication
using TLS 1.2 or higher.

When this security advisory was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?

No, B&R discovered this vulnerability as a part of its own security analyses.

When this security advisory was issued, had B&R received any reports that this
vulnerability was being exploited?

No, B&R had not received any information indicating that this vulnerability had been exploited when this
security advisory was originally issued.

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-ex-
haustive) list of cyber security practices:

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls and

separate them from any general purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, peripheral

equipment, and networks.

Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-work

other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recog-

nize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.
Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
