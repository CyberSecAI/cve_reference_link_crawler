Somnambulator was maintainedto resolve the dock intent (but not necessarily launch) and also tobe a way for launching dreams for development/test. This changelistpreserves the intent resolution, while providing the ability to launchdreams through a shell command as root.Fixes: 225878553Test: verify dreams work through docking with change.Test: adb shell cmd dreams start-dreamingTest: adb shell cmd dreams stop-dreamingChange-Id: Ia88de2e1548c12079690860a2bb75e4e79d10e66
