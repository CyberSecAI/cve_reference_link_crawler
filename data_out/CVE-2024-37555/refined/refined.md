{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated user of the vulnerable plugin, would trigger actions in the plugin without the user's knowledge or consent. This attack vector exploits the lack of proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress plugin to visit a malicious link or web page. The user must have sufficient privileges to perform the action targeted by the attacker."
