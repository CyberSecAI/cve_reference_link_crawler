{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'abp_auth_key' parameter, coupled with a missing authorization check.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions within a user's session, such as stealing session cookies or redirecting to phishing pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via the 'abp_auth_key' parameter in a POST request to the WordPress plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint of the WordPress plugin."
