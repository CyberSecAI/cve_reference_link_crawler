Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the combination of an unsafe default configuration and the ability to perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Judge0's `enable_network` configuration allows sandboxed applications to make network requests, including communication with the internal PostgreSQL database. This, coupled with the fact that the `stack_limit` column in the database is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command, leads to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SSRF:** The ability to make network requests from within the sandbox allows for SSRF to the internal PostgreSQL database.
*   **Command Injection:** By exploiting the SSRF to change the datatype of the `stack_limit` column in the database to `text`, the attacker can inject shell commands into the `isolate` command execution.
*   **Unsafe Default Configuration:** The `enable_network` setting is enabled by default or by having an empty ALLOW_ENABLE_NETWORK variable, and the default database password is easy to guess, which makes the system vulnerable by default.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `stack_limit` variable, once retrieved from the database, is not sanitized before being used as part of a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unsandboxed Code Execution:** An attacker can gain unsandboxed code execution as root on the Docker container running the submission job.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The Docker container is run using the `privileged` flag, allowing the attacker to mount the Linux host filesystem and gain full control of the host system.
*   **Complete System Access:** The attacker can gain access to the Judge0 host system, including the database, internal networks, the Judge0 webserver, and other applications on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network by exploiting the Judge0 API.
*   **SSRF:** The attacker leverages the SSRF vulnerability within the sandboxed environment to manipulate the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Judge0 API:** The attacker needs the ability to submit code execution requests to the Judge0 API.
*   **Ability to exploit SSRF:** The attacker needs the ability to construct an exploit that will leverage the SSRF to access the database.
*   **Knowledge of Default Database Password:** The attacker needs to know or brute-force the PostgreSQL password if not changed from the default.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a full Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploitation process, which involves using a python script to submit malicious code to Judge0.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for complete system compromise.
*   The vulnerability requires the `enable_network` flag to be enabled and a weak or default PostgreSQL password.
*   This vulnerability is not as severe as `CVE-2024-28185` due to the required configuration parameters for successful exploitation.
*   The fix was implemented in version 1.13.1 and higher of Judge0.
