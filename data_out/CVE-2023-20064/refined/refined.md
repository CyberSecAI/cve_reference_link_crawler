- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of unnecessary commands within the GRUB environment that allow sensitive files to be viewed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically an unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can view sensitive files on the console, potentially leading to further attacks against the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the console port of a Cisco IOS XR device during a power cycle.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the console port of the affected Cisco IOS XR device and needs to be present when the device is power cycled. They do not need any authentication.
