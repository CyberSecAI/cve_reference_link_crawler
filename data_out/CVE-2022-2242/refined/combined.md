Summary

The KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS robot control systems of KUKA KR C4 and KR C5 product
lines are affected by a severe access control vulnerability in the WorkVisual Service Host
interface.

The KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS versions before version 8.6.5 did not offer access con-
trol options for this interface. Solutions have been provided to fix this vulnerability for
versions 8.3 to 8.6.5 (see table below for version specific details).

The KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS introduced access control options for this interface
starting with version 8.6.5. However, these options were not enabled by default, as doc-
umented in the product manual.

We recommend customers to evaluate their security requirements for existing installa-
tions to decide whether they need to restrict access to the WorkVisual Service Host inter-
face. The default behavior will change for upcoming releases which will restrict the access
by default.

Additional information

The WorkVisual Service Host interface was introduced starting with KUKA SystemSoft-
ware V/KSS version 8.2. When access control is not available or not enabled, reading the
robot configuration as well as changing the configuration are possible without any au-
thentication and solely based on the network level access to TCP Port 49003.

Solution
Network isolation (see “miti-
gation” below) is required,
and we recommend upgrad-
ing to recent versions. Note:
The product has been discon-
tinued in 2016.

Access control can be added
with provided TechPackage
for version KSS 8.3.43 HF1
and VSS 8.3.25 HF1*. Note:
The product has been discon-
tinued in 2019.

Network isolation (see “miti-
gation” below) is required.
Note: Isolation is required by
the solution this product will
be integrated in.

Access control can be added
with provided TechPackage
for version 8.5.9 HF1*. Note:
The product has been discon-
tinued in 2020.

Upgrade to version 8.6.5 or
later. Access control can then
be configured (see product
manual).

Access control can be config-
ured (see product manual).
Default behavior will change
starting with version 8.6.10.
Access control can be config-
ured (see product manual).
Default behavior will change
starting with version 8.7.5.

*) Older versions must be upgraded to the latest versions to apply the TechPackage, oth-
erwise network isolation (see “mitigation” below) is required.

This information reflects our current state of knowledge. We will update this statement
should there be any additional information become available or in case the situation
would otherwise change.

Solution

Access Control Prerequisites

1.  Once the access control has been enabled, access from WorkVisual will require

authentication with valid credentials for the KukaUser for read / write access (de-
pending on the configuration).

2.  WorkVisual version: WorkVisual version 6.0.5 or later are required.
3.  Correct time setting: The clock of both the controller as well as the Workstation
running WorkVisual must be synchronized. In case of a time deviation of more
than 5 minutes, the access control feature will deny access. Please ensure the
time is in sync.

A) Solution for KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS versions from 8.6.5 onwards
With versions 8.6.5 and later the remote access restriction can be configured using the
settings under “Secure remote access”, which are documented in the system software
Operating and Programming Instructions (see chapter 5.6 “Restricting remote access to
the robot controller” the “KSS 8.7 SI V5” manual at https://xpert.kuka.com/ID/PB14656).

B) Solution for KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS versions from 8.6.0 to 8.6.4
For KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS version 8.6.0 but prior to 8.6.5, an upgrade to version
8.6.5 or later is required. The upgrade can be obtained via the Customer Support.

C) Solution for KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS versions from 8.3 to 8.5
The TechPackage KUKA.SecuredServiceHost_1.0.0.18 has been provided to add access
control for the WorkVisual Service Host interface for the latest releases of the KUKA Sys-
temSoftware V/KSS from 8.3 to 8.5. The TechPackage can be downloaded from the Secu-
rity Updates section on the KUKA homepage: https://www.kuka.com/security-updates.
Once the TechPackage is installed, read and write access via WorkVisual will be restricted
and will require authentication with KukaUser credentials. The TechPackage documenta-
tion includes details about additional configuration options.

Important
It is important to also change the default credentials for all Windows and smartHMI users
as documented in the product manuals for end-users and system integrators (see chapter
4.14 in the “KSS 8.7 END V5” manual at https://xpert.kuka.com/ID/PB14657 and chapters
5.3 - 5.5 in the “KSS 8.7 SI V5” manual at https://xpert.kuka.com/ID/PB14656).

Info about changes in the default behavior for upcoming releases
Upcoming releases of KUKA SystemSoftware V/KSS 8.6 and 8.7 restrict the access to the
WorkVisual Service Host interface by default. The setting is configurable via the
smartHMI.

Workarounds and Mitigations

As a workaround for cases where the access control feature cannot be added or enabled,
we recommend:

-  Restricting incoming network access to the product altogether and only allow re-
quired traffic. In particular, traffic to TCP port 49003 should be blocked. Note: If
access to TCP port 49003 is blocked, the following services cannot be used any-
more: WorkVisual, BackupManager.
It is still recommended to change all Windows and smartHMI users' passwords as
documented in the product manuals (see above).

-

Recommended Actions

1.  Review the provided solutions and follow the recommendations for your specific

version(s).

2.  Change the default credentials on all systems for all Windows and smartHMI us-

ers (see section “Important” above).

3.  Apply the latest Security Updates https://www.kuka.com/security-updates
4.  Enable access control on all systems or otherwise isolate the systems.

General Security Recommendations

In general, we recommend performing a risk assessment and based on this, to derive
general protective measures for production environments (network segmentation and in
particular restriction of incoming and outgoing network connections, and restriction of
physical access to systems).
