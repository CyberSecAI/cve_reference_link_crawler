- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KUKA V/KSS WorkVisual Service Host interface lacks proper access control mechanisms in versions prior to 8.6.5, and access control options are not enabled by default in later versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The WorkVisual Service Host interface, accessible via TCP port 49003, allows for reading and changing the robot configuration without any authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with network access to the affected port can read sensitive robot configurations and modify them. This could lead to disruption of the robot's operation, potentially causing damage or safety incidents.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting TCP port 49003.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the KUKA robot control systems on TCP port 49003. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
