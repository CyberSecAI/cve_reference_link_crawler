- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper permission and access control allows unauthorized modification of administrator passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Insufficient access control mechanisms, specifically related to password change requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the administrator password, potentially gaining full control of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves intercepting web requests made by a user with common (non-administrator) permissions to change a password. This implies a man-in-the-middle type attack or local access where the attacker has gained access to an authorized user's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to have common user permissions to log in to the terminal web interface and must be able to intercept the web requests to change passwords.
