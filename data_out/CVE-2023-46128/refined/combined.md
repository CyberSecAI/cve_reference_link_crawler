|  |  | After removing existing `NestedSerializers`, you can change the `fields` attribute in your serializers' `class Meta` to `\_\_all\_\_` and that will automatically include all the model's fields in the serializer, including related-model fields that would previously have required a reference to a `NestedSerializer`. If you want to exclude certain fields of the model, you can specify a list of fields you want to display in the `fields` attribute instead. |

In some cases, it may be appropriate to use `"\_\_all\_\_"` in combination with flags such as `write\_only=True` on specific fields, but proceed with caution and examine the REST API data carefully to ensure that its contents are as expected. |

# Exposure of hashed user passwords via REST API

High

[glennmatthews](/glennmatthews)
published
GHSA-r2hw-74xv-4gqp
Oct 24, 2023

## Package

pip

nautobot
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2

## Patched versions

2.0.3

## Description

### Impact

In Nautobot 2.0.x, certain REST API endpoints, in combination with the `?depth=<N>` query parameter, can expose hashed user passwords as stored in the database to any authenticated user with access to these endpoints.

> The passwords are *not* exposed in plaintext.

> Nautobot 1.x is *not* affected by this vulnerability.

Example:

```
GET /api/users/permissions/?depth=1

HTTP 200 OK
API-Version: 2.0
Allow: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept

```

```

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
> Note the "password" field present in the nested `"users"` data.

This information is not exposed during direct access to the `/api/users/users/` endpoint, but can be exposed through any endpoint which contains a nested reference to User object(s) when an appropriate `?depth=<N>` query parameter is specified. Known impacted endpoints include:

* `/api/dcim/rack-reservations/?depth=1`(or any greater `depth` value)
* `/api/extras/job-results/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)
* `/api/extras/notes/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)
* `/api/extras/object-changes/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)
* `/api/extras/scheduled-jobs/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)
* `/api/users/permissions/?depth=1` (or any greater `depth` value)

but this is not necessarily an exhaustive list.

> Plugin REST API endpoints for any models with a foreign key to the User model may also be impacted by this issue.

> The patch identified below mitigates the issue for both Nautobot core REST APIs and plugin REST APIs; no code change in plugins is required to address this issue.

### Patches

Refer to [#4692](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4692) for the patch that resolved this issue.

### Workarounds

Upgrading to v2.0.3 or later, or applying the above patch, is the preferred workaround for this issue; while it could also be partially mitigated by updating permissions to deny user access to the above list of impacted REST API endpoints, that is not recommended as other endpoints may also expose this issue until patched.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# What's Changed

* Fix an issue where nested serializers in 2.0.x didn't correctly inherit all appropriate `Meta` attributes from the base serializer.
* Add some generic REST API tests to check for inadvertent exposure of sensitive information in the REST API.

# TODO

* Explanation of Change(s)
* Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))
* n/a Attached Screenshots, Payload Example
* Unit, Integration Tests
* n/a Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)
