SAP PowerDesigner Client - version 16.7, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject VBScript code in a document and have it opened by an unsuspecting user, to have it executed by the application on behalf of the user. The application has a security option to disable or prompt users before untrusted scripts are executed, but this is not set as default.
