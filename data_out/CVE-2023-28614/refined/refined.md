Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Freewill Solutions IFIS new trading web application directly passing a user-controlled variable to a `shell_exec` function call on specific report pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core issue is that the application allows user input to influence shell commands.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who doesn't need to be authenticated.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate user-controlled input before passing it to the `shell_exec` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to gain access to user credentials and move laterally within the network.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored on or accessible by the compromised server could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the application's web interface.
*   **Shell Meta Characters:** Attackers insert shell meta characters within a user-controlled variable to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's web interface and does not need valid login credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Moderate Skill:** The attacker must be familiar with shell commands and how to inject them via web inputs.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** The vulnerable version is 20.01.01.04 of the Freewill Solutions IFIS new trading web application.
*   **Vendor Response:** The vendor did not respond to initial attempts to contact and report the vulnerability, so CERT was contacted.
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was disclosed by CERT on August 8, 2023, after initial contact to vendor failed.

This vulnerability is a serious security flaw that allows complete compromise of the server.
