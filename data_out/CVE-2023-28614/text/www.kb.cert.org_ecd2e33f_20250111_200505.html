## Freewill Solutions IFIS new trading web application vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#947701

Original Release Date: 2023-08-07 | Last Revised: 2023-08-07

---

### Overview

Freewill Solutions IFIS new trading web application version 20.01.01.04 is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary shell commands on the affected host.

### Description

Freewill Solutions IFIS new trading web application passes a user controlled variable directly to a shell\_exec function call on a specific report page. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can add shell meta characters to the user controlled variable so that the application executes attacker specified commands.

### Impact

An attacker with access to the applications web interface can execute code on the remote host. This level of access allows for complete compromise of the affected machine.

### Solution

The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.
