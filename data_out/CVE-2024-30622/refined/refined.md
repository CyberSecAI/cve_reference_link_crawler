- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow exists in the `fromAddressNat` function of the Tenda FH1205 router firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `mitInterface` parameter from a POST request is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper size validation. This allows an attacker to write past the buffer allocated for the `v2` variable on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By sending a crafted, overly long `mitInterface` value, the attacker can overwrite the return address of the function, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to the `/goform/addressNat` endpoint by sending a large value to the `mitInterface` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device and have some understanding of the device's IP address.
