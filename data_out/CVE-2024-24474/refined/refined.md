{
  "CVE-2024-24474": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "QEMU versions prior to 8.2.0 (qemu-kvm) are susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "An integer underflow in the `async_len` variable within the `esp_do_nodma` function, leading to a buffer overflow when writing to the SCSI buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Integer Underflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). Arbitrary code execution is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through a SCSI layer transfer that is incorrectly terminated, causing a mismatch between the expected transfer length and the amount of data available in the FIFO buffer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable QEMU instance, potentially through a virtual machine or other means. The provided reproducer demonstrates local exploitation via qtest, but other attack vectors could exist depending on the specific deployment."
