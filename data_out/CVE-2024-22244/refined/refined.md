- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `redirect_url` parameter in the OIDC authentication flow is not properly validated, allowing for redirection to arbitrary external URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability. The application fails to validate that the redirect URL is a local path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a `redirect_url` parameter that redirects a user to a phishing site or other malicious domain after successful OIDC login.
- **Attack vectors:** A user clicks a crafted URL containing a malicious `redirect_url` parameter, leading to redirection to an attacker-controlled site after the user logs in via OIDC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect parameter, typically shared with the user through external links. The Harbor instance must also be configured for OIDC authentication.
