Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2023-28468:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `FvbServicesRuntimeDxe` SMM module.
*   This module exposes an SMI (System Management Interrupt) handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The exposed SMI handler allows an attacker to interact with the SPI flash at runtime from the OS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can interact with the SPI flash, potentially leading to:
    *   Modification of firmware
    *   Tampering of system behavior
    *   Other malicious activities which could include arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the operating system (OS).
*   An attacker needs to gain access and be able to send SMI commands from the OS to the vulnerable SMI handler.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have privileged access to the OS. This implies a high privilege level is required (PR:H).
*   The attacker also needs to understand the workings of the SMI interface in order to send the correct commands. (AC:H)
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the local machine (AV:L)

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 6.1, categorized as "Medium" severity.
*   The vulnerability has a scope change, which means the vulnerability impacts the firmware beyond just the OS. (S:C)
*   The impact is on Integrity and Availability. The confidentiality is not impacted in the same way. (C:N/I:H/A:L)
*   The vulnerability was reported by researchers from IOActive Inc.
*   Patches are available in different kernel versions.
