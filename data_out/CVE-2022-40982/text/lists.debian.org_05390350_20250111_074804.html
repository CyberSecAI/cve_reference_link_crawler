Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.179-5~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-40982 CVE-2023-20569

CVE-2022-40982

    Daniel Moghimi discovered Gather Data Sampling (GDS), a hardware
    vulnerability for Intel CPUs which allows unprivileged speculative
    access to data which was previously stored in vector registers.

    This mitigation requires updated CPU microcode provided in the
    intel-microcode package.

    For details please refer to <<https://downfall.page/>> and
    <<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/gather-data-sampling.html>>.

CVE-2023-20569

    Daniel Trujillo, Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi discovered
    INCEPTION, also known as Speculative Return Stack Overflow (SRSO),
    a transient execution attack that leaks arbitrary data on all AMD
    Zen CPUs. An attacker can mis-train the CPU BTB to predict non-
    architectural CALL instructions in kernel space and use this to
    control the speculative target of a subsequent kernel RET,
    potentially leading to information disclosure via a speculative
    side-channel.

    For details please refer to
    <<https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/inception/>> and
    <<https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005>>.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.179-5~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.
