Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `filter[Id]` parameter when parsing filters in the `web/skins/classic/views/filter.php` file. Specifically, the `$_REQUEST['filter']['Id']` value was not properly sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, as an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `filter[Id]` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view a crafted filter. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based, where a crafted URL with a malicious `filter[Id]` parameter can be sent to a user.
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft a URL with the vulnerable parameter (`filter[Id]`) containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or credentials on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** User interaction is limited to viewing the crafted URL, making exploitation very feasible
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter `filter[Id]` exists in the filter view.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ZoneMinder versions <= 1.36.33 and <= 1.37.60.
- The fix was implemented in versions 1.36.34 and 1.37.61.
- The provided commit `062cf568a33fb6a8604ec327b1de8bb2e0d1ff77` includes the necessary sanitization using `validInt()`.
- The CVSS score is 0.0, which may be incorrect. The vulnerability is clearly an XSS with a low CVSS score, which is not correct. The CVSS metrics indicate: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N
- The fix sanitizes the `$_REQUEST['filter']['Id']` value by casting it to an integer using `validInt()`.
- The vulnerability was assigned GHSA-6rrw-66rf-6g5f in addition to CVE-2024-43358.
