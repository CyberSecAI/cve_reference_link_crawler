Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in GitLab's "Custom dashboard projects" settings. Specifically, the system allows users with the `Guest` role, who are not intended to modify project settings, to change the `Custom dashboard projects` settings for projects within a group they have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for modifying the `Custom dashboard projects` settings. The system fails to prevent `Guest` users from accessing and altering these settings, which are intended to be restricted to higher-level roles.
- **Direct Access to Settings Page:** Guests can directly access the settings page by manually appending `/-/settings/analytics` to the project URL, bypassing the standard UI restrictions.
- **Unintended Functionality:** The vulnerability exposes a discrepancy between the documented permissions of `Guest` users and their actual capabilities within the `Custom dashboard projects` settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification of Project Settings:** An attacker with a `Guest` role can modify the `Custom dashboard projects` settings of a project. This could include changing the target project for the custom dashboards.
- **Potential Data Exposure or Manipulation:** While the provided report does not explicitly state further impacts, modifying the analytics dashboard settings may lead to unintended data exposure or manipulation depending on the capabilities of custom dashboards.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly accesses the settings page by appending `/-/settings/analytics` to the project URL.
- **Form Submission:** The attacker then submits a form to change the `Custom dashboard projects` setting, thus taking advantage of the lack of authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs an account on the GitLab instance.
- **Guest Role Access:** The attacker needs to be granted the `Guest` role within the victim's project or group.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manually modify the URL of the project to access the settings page directly.

**Additional Information:**
- The report includes a video PoC that demonstrates the attack.
- The issue is reproducible by creating a GitLab account with the `Ultimate SaaS Plan Trial` and adding the attacker as a guest.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `Custom dashboard projects` settings within the analytics section of project settings.
