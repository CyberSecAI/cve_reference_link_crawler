Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues in how CoreWCF handles connections when using NetFraming based services (NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding):

1.  **Indefinite Wait for Handshake:** When a client establishes a connection but sends no data, the service waits indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. The server does not close the connection on timeout, leaving the connection open and consuming resources.
2.  **Improper Connection Closure on Timeout:** When a client establishes a session, and subsequently does not send any requests within the `ReceiveTimeout` period configured in the binding, the connection is not properly closed when the session is aborted. The server-side timeout logic does not send a RST packet to the client, leaving the connection open.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly close connections when they are idle or timed out, leading to resource exhaustion on the server. This can manifest as increased memory usage, open socket handles, and ultimately impacting the service's availability.
*   **Lack of RST Packet:** The server fails to send a RST packet to the client after a timeout, leading the client to believe that the connection is still active when it is not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to create a denial-of-service condition by an attacker repeatedly opening connections without sending any data or by letting connections time out without closing them. This consumes server resources, potentially making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Resource Starvation:** The accumulation of open, idle connections can starve the server of resources, impacting the performance and reliability of the service and other applications running on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network by opening connections to a CoreWCF service that uses `NetTcpBinding` (this is the only binding that accepts non-local connections).
*   **Unauthenticated:** This vulnerability doesn't require any specific credentials. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by establishing a connection and then either not sending data (triggering the handshake timeout) or sending data to establish a session and then doing nothing (triggering `ReceiveTimeout`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable service.
*   No specific privileges or credentials are required.
*   The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects CoreWCF versions 1.4.1 and 1.5.1.
*   The fix is available in versions 1.4.2 and 1.5.2.
*   There are no known workarounds, and updating to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with high availability impact.
*   The issue was tracked in GitHub issue #1345.
*   The fix was implemented in pull request #1348.
*  The vulnerability is identified by the GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-32jq-mv89-5rx7.
