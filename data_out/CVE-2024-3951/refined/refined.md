- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious code in the application. This could lead to various issues like data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity. The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or interacting with crafted content, but no special privileges or position within the system are required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through the application. This can be done without any prior authentication.
