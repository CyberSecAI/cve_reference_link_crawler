Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-25977:

**Vulnerability:** Session Fixation

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not regenerate or change the session token (PHPSESSID) upon user login or logout. This allows an attacker to manipulate the session ID.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Lack of session token regeneration.
    *   Vulnerable session management.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can fixate a victim's session, meaning the attacker can gain access to the victim's account.
    *   After the victim logs in, both the attacker and the victim will share the same session.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Browser Manipulation:** The attacker can set a specific `PHPSESSID` value in the victim's browser.
    *   **Prompting Login:** The attacker can trick the victim into logging in (e.g., via a redirect to the login page) while the attacker's session token is still set in the victim's browser

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to set cookies in the victim's browser, which can be achieved through various methods (e.g., XSS).
    *   The attacker does not need a valid account.
    *   The attacker and victim must be interacting with the same application instance, sharing the same session id.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in HAWKI versions 1.0.0-beta.1 and prior to commit `146967f`.
*   The fix is available in GitHub commit `146967f`.
*   There is no workaround available.
