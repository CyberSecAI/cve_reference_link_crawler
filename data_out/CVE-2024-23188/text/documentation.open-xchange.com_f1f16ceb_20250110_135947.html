![Release 8.22](/appsuite/releases/assets/banner_8.22-DYkh5w89.jpeg)

Still very early in the year, we are excited to announce the release of App Suite 8.22! This latest release includes major feature updates and numerous bug fixes. Again we ship a lot of improvements for the mobile UI.

**Forward meeting invitations:** Adding additional participants to a meeting is now as simple as forwarding the invitation to those people.

A detailed list of changes can be found in the [changelogs](/appsuite/releases/8.22/changelogs/ui.html).

Released: February 2024
