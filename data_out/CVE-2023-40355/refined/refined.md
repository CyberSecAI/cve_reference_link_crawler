- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An XSS vulnerability exists in the Axigen WebMail logic that allows users to switch between the Standard and Ajax versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an active user session. This allows them to access, retrieve, and exfiltrate mailbox content (emails and folders).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted link, often delivered via phishing emails or other messaging methods. When the link is opened by a logged-in user, the malicious JavaScript code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted link to a logged-in user to trigger the XSS vulnerability. They require no initial access other than the ability to send the link.
