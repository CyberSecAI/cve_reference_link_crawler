    "description": "Fix path traversal vulnerabilities in MediaProviderCanonicalize filepath provided by the caller when hanling SCAN_FILE_CALL method call in MediaProvider. Additionally, make sure to check access permission in SCAN_FILE_CALL(using enforceCallingPermissionInternal()). Preemptively canonicalize Files provided as an arguments to the publicAPI methods in ModernMediaScanner (scanFile(), scanDirectory() and onDirectoryDirty()) to prevent path traversal attacks.",
