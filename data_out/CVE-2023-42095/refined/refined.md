  "CVE-2023-42095": {
    "source_text": "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation. (CVE-2024-12751, CVE-2024-12752, CVE-2024-49576, CVE-2024-47810)\n\nThis vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation when handling AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects; as well as lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Annotation objects, which leads to reading past the end of an allocated buffer.",
