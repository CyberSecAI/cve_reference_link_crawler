Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3888:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (dxgkrnl.sys). Specifically, the driver improperly handles objects in memory, which can lead to a double fetch vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper memory handling by the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.
- Double fetch vulnerability, where the driver fetches the same memory location twice without proper validation, potentially leading to a race condition or use-after-free scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:

- Execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- Gain complete control over the affected system.
- Install programs.
- View, change, or delete data.
- Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local attack: An attacker must first gain valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system.
- Specially crafted application: The attacker needs to run a malicious application designed to trigger the vulnerability in the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Valid user credentials on the target system.
- Ability to log on locally to the target system.
- Ability to execute code on the target system (i.e., running the crafted application).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.
- The provided document specifies that workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk, but servers can be at higher risk if users are allowed to log on and run programs.
