# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-081 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2870008)

Published: October 08, 2013 | Updated: January 14, 2014

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves seven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views shared content that embeds OpenType or TrueType font files. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Windows handles specially crafted OpenType Font files and specially crafted TrueType Font (TTF) files, and by correcting the way that Windows handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3128

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows parses specially crafted OpenType fonts (OTF). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3128).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, the Preview and Details panes are disabled in Windows Explorer in Windows 8. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Clear both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer.

**Impact of workaround**. Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.

**How to undo the workaround**

To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview pane and Details pane in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Select both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Windows does not properly parse OpenType fonts.

**What is fontembedding?**

Font embedding, supported through Microsoft OpenType and TrueType specifications, is a feature of Microsoft applications that enables fonts to be embedded in a document. This ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets web authors create font objects that are linked to their webpages so that when viewed through the browser, pages are displayed in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see [About Font Embedding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533034.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious webpage that contains a specifically crafted embedded font. When the user visits the malicious site, the vulnerability could result in remote code execution as the embedded font is parsed and displayed.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Windows parses OpenType fonts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

## TrueType Font CMAP Table Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3894

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows parses specially crafted TrueType fonts (TTF). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3894](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3894).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, the Preview and Details panes are disabled in Windows Explorer in Windows 8. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Clear both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer.

**Impact of workaround**. Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.

**How to undo the workaround**

To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview pane and Details pane in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Select both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver does not properly parse the CMAP table when rendering a specially crafted TrueType font.

**What is fontembedding?**

Font embedding, supported through Microsoft OpenType and TrueType specifications, are a feature of Microsoft applications that enables fonts to be embedded in a document. This ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets web authors create font objects that are linked to their webpages so that when viewed through the browser, pages are displayed in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see [About Font Embedding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533034.aspx).

**What is a CMAP table?**

A CMAP table defines the mapping of character codes to the glyph index values used in the font. It may contain more than one sub-table in order to support more than one character encoding scheme. The table header indicates the character encodings for which sub-tables are present. Each sub-table is in one of seven possible formats and begins with a format code indicating the format used. For more information, see [Character to Glyph Index Mapping Table](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/cmap.htm).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious webpage that contains a specially crafted embedded font. When the user visits the malicious site, the vulnerability could result in remote code execution as the embedded font is parsed and displayed.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**
