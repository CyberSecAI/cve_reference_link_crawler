{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `stb_image.h` library contains a vulnerability related to uninitialized memory disclosure, triggered during the loading of TGA images.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory use",
         "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability may allow for information disclosure by reading data from uninitialized memory locations. This can leak internal program memory and potentially reveal sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious TGA image that will cause the `stbi__getn` function to reach the end of the input stream without fully initializing the buffer. This is achieved when there isn't enough data in the stream to populate the buffers in `stbi__tga_load`, resulting in uninitialized memory. Subsequent reads then read from the uninitialized buffer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted TGA image to an application using the affected library. No specific attacker privileges or positions are needed beyond that."
