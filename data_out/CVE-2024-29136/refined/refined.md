Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a PHP Object Injection vulnerability. This occurs when user-supplied input is unserialized without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious PHP objects due to insecure unserialization of user-controlled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- **Code Injection:** Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
- **SQL Injection:** Manipulation of database queries.
- **Path Traversal:** Access to files and directories outside of the intended web root.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
- The specific impact depends on the presence of a suitable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the insecure unserialization of user-controlled input within the WordPress Tourfic plugin. This likely involves manipulating data sent to the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted data to the vulnerable plugin to trigger the unserialization of a malicious object.
- The attacker requires the "subscriber" privilege to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the Tourfic plugin <= 2.11.17.
- The fix is available in version 2.11.19.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS score of 8.5.
- A virtual patch has been released by Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by LVT-tholv2k.
