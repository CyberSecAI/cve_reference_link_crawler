{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PDU outlet management function incorrectly checks for the administrator UID, allowing an attacker with a valid unprivileged session ID to control PDU outlets via POST request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect Access Control"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can turn off outlets, causing a denial of service (DoS) to systems relying on the PDU.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/outlet_access/connections.cgi` endpoint, including a valid session ID (SID) and a manipulated administrator UID (UID=8)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a valid unprivileged session ID."
