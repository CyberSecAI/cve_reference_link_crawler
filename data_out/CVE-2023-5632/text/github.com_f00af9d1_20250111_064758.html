### @przemyslawzygmunt **[przemyslawzygmunt](/przemyslawzygmunt)** commented [Jan 27, 2021](#issue-795283945)

Hi.

It is very easy to make Mosquitto use 100% of the CPU. Just run the command:

openssl s\_client -connect mosquitt-server: 8883

I ran a look at the server code today and found the cause of the problem.

Until a timeout occurs, the server will continue to execute the main loop without pausing. This is because epoll\_wait gets the EPOLLOUT event all the time. Below are two diagrams showing the CPU consumption with and without the fix.

Unfixed (100% CPU):

[mosquitto-cpuprof-TooHigh.pdf](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/files/5881791/mosquitto-cpuprof-TooHigh.pdf)

with the fix (0.7% CPU):

[mosquitto-cpuprof-Normal.pdf](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/files/5881792/mosquitto-cpuprof-Normal.pdf)

[@ralight](https://github.com/ralight) should check if my patch does not restore the problem that his commit solved

| I've manually cherry picked the commit to the `fixes` branch: [18bad1f](https://github.com/eclipse-mosquitto/mosquitto/commit/18bad1ff32435e523d7507e9b2ce0010124a8f2d) Github doesn't pick that up because it doesn't have a merge commit so I'll have to close this. Thanks for your contribution! |
