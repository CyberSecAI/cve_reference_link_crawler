The content is related to a fix for a 100% CPU usage issue in mosquitto, which is likely a vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unconditionally adding an event to the epoll, specifically `EPOLLOUT`, caused the main loop to continuously execute without pausing. This occurs when a connection to the server is established but the client has not sent any data. The `epoll_wait` system call would always return due to the constant readiness for writing, leading to the high CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the logic for handling `EPOLLOUT` events when a client connects but does not send data. The server continuously tries to write data when there's no data to write or no data being sent, leading to a busy loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is 100% CPU usage on the server. This could lead to denial of service for other clients.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by establishing a connection to the MQTT server (e.g., `openssl s_client -connect mosquitt-server:8883`) and not sending any data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to open a network connection to the MQTT server. No authentication is mentioned, implying that any client capable of network connection can trigger the vulnerability.
