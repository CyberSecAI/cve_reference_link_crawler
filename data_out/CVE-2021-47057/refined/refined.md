The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47057.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `sun8i_ss_prng_generate` function within the `drivers/crypto/allwinner/sun8i-ss/sun8i-ss-prng.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When the DMA mapping of the IV (initialization vector) fails, the allocated memory for object `d` is not released, leading to a memory leak.
- Specifically, the code lacked an error handling path to free the memory allocated to `d` before returning when `dma_map_single` fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion if the vulnerable function is called repeatedly under conditions that cause `dma_iv` mapping to fail. Over time, this may result in system instability.
- The leak is a resource exhaustion vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any process that uses the sun8i-ss PRNG driver when `dma_map_single` for the IV fails
- There is no direct attacker controlled trigger. It is triggered by an internal error.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to use the sun8i-ss PRNG driver.
- No specific network access or local file access is needed.
