**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from weak password requirements. Specifically, the system allows for passwords that are short (4 characters) and susceptible to dictionary attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient password complexity requirements.
-  Storage of password hashes that can be retrieved from the machine.
-  Vulnerability to dictionary attacks against the weak passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker can:
- Retrieve stored password hashes from the ATM.
- Crack these hashes using dictionary attacks due to the weak password policy.
- Gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
Physical access to the ATM is required to interact with the machine, retrieve hashes, and attempt to crack the passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the Lamassu Bitcoin ATM Douro machine.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the machine and retrieve stored password hashes.
- The attacker needs the ability to perform dictionary attacks on the retrieved password hashes.
