{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses user-controlled input from the $_SESSION['username'] variable within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Second-order SQL injection vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, leading to data leakage of user types and user IDs, or even potentially causing a database shutdown.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request with a malicious username, the attacker can inject SQL code into the session variable which is later used in the SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable page and manipulate the `username` parameter."
