### Description

The myCred – Loyalty Points and Rewards plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce – Give Points, Ranks, Badges, Cashback, WooCommerce rewards, and WooCommerce credits for Gamification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the mycred\_update\_database() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upgrade an out of date database.
