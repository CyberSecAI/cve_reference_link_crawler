Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `admin/activatestud.php` file of the Online Courseware application.
*   The `selector[]` parameter in a POST request to this file is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because the value of the `selector[]` parameter is directly embedded into the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access, delete, or alter sensitive data such as customer information, personal data, trade secrets, and intellectual property without authorization.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful SQL injection can potentially grant the attacker full control over the database, leading to complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/activatestud.php`, where the `selector[]` parameter contains malicious SQL code.
*   **Specifically, the `selector[]` parameter in the `POST` request is vulnerable.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the application and its forms that allow interaction with the vulnerable page `admin/activatestud.php`.
*   **Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP POST requests.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $edittable=$_POST['selector'];
    $N = count($edittable);
    for($i=0; $i < $N; $i++)
    {
        $result = mysqli_query($conn,"UPDATE student SET mem_status='active' where id='$edittable[$i]'");
    }
    ```
*   The provided proof of vulnerability demonstrates how the `selector[]` parameter can be manipulated to inject SQL using the sqlmap tool. The specific payload used in the example is:
     `bnm=activate&selector[]=1%'+(SELECT 0x6c464368 WHERE 4674=4674 AND (SELECT 9726 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))sFWt))+'`
*  The vulnerability allows for time-based blind SQL injection, as demonstrated by the `SLEEP(5)` function in the payload.
