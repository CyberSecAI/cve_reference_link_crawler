| I triggered a SEGV bug when fuzzing gobgp.  The config of the under-test node is as follows, and its IP is `10.0.255.6`  ``` [global.config]   as = 65001   router-id = "192.168.10.6"   [[neighbors]]   [neighbors.config]     neighbor-address = "10.0.255.5"     peer-as = 64512  ```  The fuzzing node is deployed on `10.0.255.5`.

| Hello together,  I looked into the code and found a possible reason for the segv message (unfortunate I do not have time to test the pcap stream against a fixed version to confirm my assumptions), anyway here are my thoughts:  The function [(h \*fsmHandler) recvMessageWithError()](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/server/fsm.go#L985) calls `hd.DecodeFromBytes` which [parses the bytes into BGPHeader](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/packet/bgp/bgp.go#L14743), but does not check the type. Later the function recvMessageWithError() calls [ParseBGPBody](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/server/fsm.go#L1019C16-L1019C28), which actually calls [parseBody](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/packet/bgp/bgp.go#L14773) which checks the header type and if it is unknown, it returns nil and an error. Thus the [check for an error](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/server/fsm.go#L1020) is true and it calls [handlingError](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/server/fsm.go#L1021) with m being a nil BGPMessage and the [function deferences a nil pointer](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/a74149f9efddc131020827271ff61568dc13520a/pkg/server/fsm.go#L914).  What do you think about it, does this make sense? Could this be the reason for the segv? |
