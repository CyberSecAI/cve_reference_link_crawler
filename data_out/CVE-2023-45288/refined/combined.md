Subject: CERT/CC VU#421644: HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames can be utilized for DoS
 attacks

<https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644> announces:

> HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames can be utilized for DoS attacks
> ==========================================================
>
> Vulnerability Note VU#421644
> Original Release Date: 2024-04-03 | Last Revised: 2024-04-03
>
> Overview
> --------
>
> HTTP allows messages to include named fields in both header and
> trailer sections. These header and trailer fields are serialised as
> field blocks in HTTP/2, so that they can be transmitted in multiple
> fragments to the target implementation. Many HTTP/2 implementations do
> not properly limit or sanitize the amount of CONTINUATION frames sent
> within a single stream. An attacker that can send packets to a target
> server can send a stream of CONTINUATION frames that will not be
> appended to the header list in memory but will still be processed and
> decoded by the server or will be appended to the header list, causing
> an out of memory (OOM) crash.
>
> Description
> -----------
>
> HTTP/2 utilizes header fields within HTTP request and response
> messages. Header fields can comprise header lists, which in turn are
> broken into header blocks. These header blocks are transmitted in
> multiple fragments to the target implementation. HTTP/2 CONTINUATION
> frames are used to continue a sequence of field block fragments. They
> are utilized in order to split header blocks across multiple
> frames. The other two types of header block fragments are HEADERS or
> PUSH_PROMISE. CONTINUATION frames can be utilized to continue a header
> block fragment that could not be transmitted by the HEADERS or
> PUSH_PROMISE frames. A header block is considered completed when the
> server receives a set END_HEADERS flag. This is intended to denote
> that there are no further CONTINUATION, HEADERS, or PUSH_PROMISE
> frames. A vulnerability has been discovered within multiple
> implementations that does not limit the amount of CONTINUATION frames
> that can be sent within a single stream.
>
> The implementation will continue to receive frames as long as the
> END_HEADERS flag is not set during these communications. An attacker
> can initialize a connection to a server with typical HTTP/2 frames and
> then receive initial frames from the server. The attacker can then
> begin an HTTP request with no set END_HEADERS flags. This can allow an
> attacker to send a stream of CONTINUATION frames to the target server,
> which can result in an out-of-memory crash, enabling an attacker to
> launch a denial of service (DoS) attack against a target server using
> a vulnerable implementation.
>
> Additionally, an attacker can send HPACK Huffman encoded CONTINUATION
> frames to a target implementation. This can cause CPU resource
> exhaustion and result in a DoS as the the CPU must decode every
> encoded frame that it receives.
>
> Below are several CVE listings to reflect the vulnerability within
> different implementations.
>
> CVE-2024-27983
>
> An attacker can make the Node.js HTTP/2 server unavailable by sending
> a small amount of HTTP/2 frames packets with a few HTTP/2 frames
> inside. It is possible to leave some data in nghttp2 memory after
> reset when headers with HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frame are sent to the
> server and then a TCP connection is abruptly closed by the client
> triggering the Http2Session destructor while header frames are still
> being processed (and stored in memory) causing a race condition.
>
> CVE-2024-27919
>
> Envoy's oghttp codec does not reset a request when header map limits
> have been exceeded. This allows an attacker to send an sequence of
> CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing unlimited
> memory consumption.
>
> CVE-2024-2758
>
> Tempesta FW rate limits are not enabled by default. They are either
> set too large to capture empty CONTINUATION frames attacks or too
> small to handle normal HTTP requests appropriately.
>
> CVE-2024-2653
>
> amphp/http will collect HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames in an unbounded
> buffer and will not check the header size limit until it has received
> the END_HEADERS flag, resulting in an OOM crash. amphp/http-client and
> amphp/http-server are indirectly affected if they're used with an
> unpatched version of amphp/http. Early versions of amphp/http-client
> with HTTP/2 support (v4.0.0-rc10 to 4.0.0) are also directly affected.
>
> CVE-2023-45288
>
> The Go packages net/http and net/http2 packages do not limit the
> number of CONTINUATION frames read for an HTTP/2 request, which
> permits an attacker to provide an arbitrarily large set of headers for
> a single request, that will be read, decoded, and subsequently
> discarded, which may result in excessive CPU consumption.
>
> CVE-2024-28182
>
> An implementation using the nghttp2 library will continue to receive
> CONTINUATION frames, and will not callback to the application to allow
> visibility into this information before it resets the stream,
> resulting in a DoS.
>
> CVE-2024-27316
>
> HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS flag set can be
> sent in a continuous stream by an attacker to an Apache Httpd
> implementation, which will not properly terminate the request early.
>
> CVE-2024-31309
>
> HTTP/2 CONTINUATION DoS attack can cause Apache Traffic Server to
> consume more resources on the server. Version from 8.0.0 through
> 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.3 are affected.
>
> CVE-2024-30255
>
> HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions 1.29.2 or earlier are
> vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION
> frames. Envoys HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited
> number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoys header map
> limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION
> frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization,
> consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic.
>
> Impact
> ------
>
> Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker
> the capability to launch DoS attacks against servers utilizing
> vulnerable implementations.
>
> Solution
> --------
>
> Different HTTP/2 implementations may have separate, unique
> vulnerabilities specific to that implementation. It is important to
> note that it may be difficult to analyze incoming malicious traffic
> exploiting this vulnerability as the HTTP request is not properly
> completed. Analysis of raw HTTP traffic may be necessary to determine
> an attack utilizing this vulnerability.
>
> Acknowledgements

| Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and process all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, we don't allocate memory to store the excess headers but we do parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.  Set a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski (<https://nowotarski.info/>) for reporting this issue.  This is [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288") and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65051> (this issue).   ---   This is a [PRIVATE](https://go.dev/security/policy#private) issue for [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288"), tracked in <http://b/319262343> and fixed by <http://tg/2130527>.  /cc @golang/security and @golang/release |

Current status: This is the main issue for [CVE-2023-45288](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m "CVE-2023-45288"). [#65387](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65387) is the 1.21 backport [#66298](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/66298) is the 1.22 backport  [#65386](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/65386) was the 1.20 backport, obsolete because we missed the 1.20 window. |

Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and process
all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection.
When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, we don't
allocate memory to store the excess headers but we do
parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2
endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of data, all associated
with a request which is going to be rejected.

Set a limit on the amount of excess header frames we
will process before closing a connection.

Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski for reporting this issue.

| Can someone please clarify something for me? I have a Golang project that relies on `net/http` and has `golang.org/x/net` in its `go.mod` file.  Is it the case that moving my project to Go v1.21.9 is **sufficient** to address this issue? Or do I **ALSO** need to run `go get -u golang.org/x/net@v0.23.0`? |

Subject: Go 1.22.2 and 1.21.9 (CVE-2023-45288 HTTP/2 CONTINUATION issue)

[ Forwarding another announcement I didn't see on this
list relating to VU#421644 ]

<https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M>

| We have just released Go versions 1.22.2 and 1.21.9,
| minor point releases.
|
| These minor releases include 1 security fixes
| following the security policy:
|
| http2: close connections when receiving too many
| headers
|
| Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and
| process all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a
| connection. When a request's headers exceed
| MaxHeaderBytes, we don't allocate memory to store the
| excess headers but we do parse them. This permits an
| attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary
| amounts of header data, all associated with a request
| which is going to be rejected. These headers can
| include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly
| more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an
| attacker to send.
|
| Set a limit on the amount of excess header frames we
| will process before closing a connection.
|
| Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski (<https://nowotarski.info/>)
| for reporting this issue.
|
| This is CVE-2023-45288 and Go issue
| <https://go.dev/issue/65051>.
|
| View the release notes for more information:
| <https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.2>
|
| You can download binary and source distributions from
| the Go website:
| <https://go.dev/dl/>
|
| To compile from source using a Git clone, update to
| the release with
| git checkout go1.22.2 and build as usual.
|
| Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.22.2 and 1.21.9, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 1 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* http2: close connections when receiving too many headers

  Maintaining HPACK state requires that we parse and process all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, we don't allocate memory to store the excess headers but we do parse them. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

  Set a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.

  Thanks to Bartek Nowotarski (<https://nowotarski.info/>) for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2023-45288 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/65051>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.2>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.22.2` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Than and Dmitri for the Go team

# Vulnerability Report: GO-2024-2687

standard library

* CVE-2023-45288, GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m
* Affects:
  net/http, golang.org/x/net
* Published: Apr 03, 2024
* Modified: May 20, 2024

An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.
Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed.
This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.
The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.
