- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the link href attribute within the Open Link plugin for CKEditor.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected through the link href attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious link with JavaScript code in the href attribute, which is then processed by the vulnerable Open Link plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to insert malicious link with javascript code in the href attribute through the vulnerable CKEditor plugin.
