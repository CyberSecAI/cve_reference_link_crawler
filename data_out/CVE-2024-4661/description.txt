The WP Reset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_ajax function in all versions up to, and including, 2.02. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to modify the value fo the 'License Key' field for the 'Activate Pro License' setting.
