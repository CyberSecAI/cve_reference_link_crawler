- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient signature validation of software images during the software upgrade process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper verification of software image signatures, leading to a vulnerability where a modified image can be installed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to root.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker with administrator-level privileges can upload and install a modified software image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level privileges on the affected Cisco APIC or Cisco Cloud Network Controller system.
