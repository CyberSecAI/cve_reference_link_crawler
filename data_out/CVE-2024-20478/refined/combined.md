This vulnerability is due to insufficient signature validation of software images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to *root*.  **Note:** Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capic-priv-esc-uYQJjnuU>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.       | Cisco APIC Software Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 5.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 5.3 | 5.3(2d) (Sep 2024) |   | 6.0 | 6.0(6c) |   | 6.1 | Not vulnerable. |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.  **Cisco Cloud Network Controller**  Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. Cisco Cloud Network Controller has entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notice for Cisco Cloud Network Controller:  [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/cloud-application-policy-infrastructure-controller/cloud-network-controller-eol.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/cloud-application-policy-infrastructure-controller/cloud-network-controller-eol.html "https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/cloud-application-policy-infrastructure-controller/cloud-network-controller-eol.html")  When considering a software migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the new product type will be sufficient for their network needs and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
