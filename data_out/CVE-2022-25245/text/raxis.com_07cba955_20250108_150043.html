[# CVE-2022-25245: ManageEngine Asset Explorer Information Leakage](https://raxis.com/blog/cve-2022-25245/)

I’m Matt Dunn, a lead penetration tester at Raxis. Recently, I discovered an information leakage in ManageEngine Asset Explorer. This is a relatively minor information leakage, as it only leaks the currency that a current vendor uses. Though minor, it could lead to other inferred information such as vendor location based on their currency.

###### **Proof of Concept**

The information leakage occurs in the AJaxDomainServlet when given the action of *getVendorCurrency*. This servlet action does not require authentication, allowing a user to obtain a vendor’s currency with a GET request to a URL similar to the following:

```
http://192.168.148.128:8011/domainServlet/AJaxDomainServlet?action=getVendorCurrency&vendorId=3
```

In this example URL, we request the currency for the vendor with the specified *vendorId*. If the vendor doesn’t have an assigned currency, the dollar symbol is returned. If it does, the vendor’s specific currency identifier is returned, as shown here:
