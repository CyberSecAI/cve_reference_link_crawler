{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper validation of file content types or file content during the file upload process. It does not restrict the upload of PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The application does not check the content type or content of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload malicious PHP scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a PHP file containing malicious code and then execute it, leading to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uses the file upload functionality in the 'Edit profile' section of the web application. They upload a PHP file containing malicious code and then execute it, leading to remote code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application in order to access the 'Edit Profile' functionality. They also need to be able to intercept requests, for example using Burp Suite, to modify the content type of the uploaded file."
