Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `mt7921_coredump_work` function within the MediaTek mt76 driver for the mt7921 WiFi chip. The issue arises when processing sk_buff (socket buffer) data related to a coredump.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The code does not free the `skb` (socket buffer) when the combined size of data and the current `skb` length exceeds the `MT76_CONNAC_COREDUMP_SZ` limit. In such cases the loop continues with `continue` but the `skb` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory exhaustion:** Repeated triggering of coredump collection could lead to exhaustion of kernel memory, potentially causing system instability or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a device with a mt7921 wireless chip that triggers a coredump.
- It could be triggered by an attacker sending malformed packets or otherwise causing the chip to generate a coredump which is then processed by the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the mt7921 chip to initiate a coredump.
- This may involve sending specific packets or exploiting other vulnerabilities that might lead to the triggering of a coredump.

**More Details:**
The provided diffs show the fix, which adds `dev_kfree_skb(skb);` to free the `skb` when the size check fails, resolving the memory leak.
The fix has been backported to multiple stable branches as visible in the first log.
