The provided content relates to CVE-2021-23490.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `checkHeader` function of the `parse-link-header` package. This function is used to validate the link header input before parsing it. The regex used by the `checkHeader` function is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking when processing long inputs with specific patterns, leading to excessive CPU consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `checkHeader` function.
- Catastrophic backtracking due to the regex's structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS).
- Excessive CPU consumption.
- The system becomes inaccessible to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted, extremely long link header with a specific pattern that triggers the ReDoS vulnerability in the `checkHeader` function.
- The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and is remotely exploitable

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server utilizing the vulnerable library.
