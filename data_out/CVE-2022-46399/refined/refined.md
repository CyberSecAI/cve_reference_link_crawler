  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Bluetooth Low Energy implementation in affected Microchip devices does not properly handle a Connection Request Timeout with a zero value (ConReqTimeoutZero).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of a Connection Request Timeout with a zero value."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker within radio range can send a specially crafted Bluetooth Low Energy packet to cause a denial of service (DoS) to the Bluetooth functionality of the device. This attack causes the smartphone to shut down both Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) without user notification. The user must manually restart Bluetooth LE, and possibly the smartphone, to regain functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio communication"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be within radio range of the target device and have the ability to send BLE packets.",
     "more_info": "The provided content contains additional vulnerability information beyond the official CVE description. Specifically, it details the impact and the required actions from the user to regain the Bluetooth function and confirms it affects Microchip Bluetooth products BM64, BM70, BM71, BM77, BM78, BM83, IS1870, IS1871, RN4678, RN4870, RN4871, PIC32CX1012BZ25048, WBZ451."
