The provided content describes three high-risk vulnerabilities in the smanga application:

**1. Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/php/manga/delete.php` endpoint is vulnerable because it directly uses a user-controlled parameter (`mangaPath`) in a `rm -rf` command without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The endpoint is accessible without authentication, which allows any attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted request to `/php/manga/delete.php` with a malicious `mangaId` and `deleteFile` parameters. The payload leverages a SQL injection to manipulate the `mangaPath` variable used in the `rm -rf` command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**2. Unauthenticated SQL Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/php/history/add.php` endpoint is vulnerable because the parameters `mediaId`, `mangaId`, and `userId` are directly incorporated into SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    *  **Unauthenticated Access:** The endpoint is accessible without authentication, allowing any attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database or potentially modify the data.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted request to `/php/history/add.php` with malicious `mediaId`, `mangaId`, or `userId` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/php/get-file-flow.php` endpoint is vulnerable because the `file` parameter is not validated, allowing for path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `file` parameter.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The endpoint is accessible without authentication, allowing any attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, etc.
*  **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted request to `/php/get-file-flow.php` with a manipulated `file` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
