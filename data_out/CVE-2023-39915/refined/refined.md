- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient checking of input data in the decoding library `bcder` used by Routinator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Crafted RPKI objects can trigger a crash in Routinator due to improper input data handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Routinator crashes when processing specially crafted RPKI objects.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious RPKI objects crafted to exploit the `bcder` library's insufficient input validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious RPKI objects into a system where they are processed by vulnerable Routinator instances.
