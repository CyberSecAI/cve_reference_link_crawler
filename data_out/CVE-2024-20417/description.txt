Multiple vulnerabilities in the REST API of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct blind SQL injection attacks.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in REST API calls. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify data on the affected device.
