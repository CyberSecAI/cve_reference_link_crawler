Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an Out-of-Bounds Write that occurs when parsing a maliciously crafted DWF file in `AdDwfPdk.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is that the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can corrupt memory and lead to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Crash:** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash of the application.
- **Sensitive Data Read:** An attacker might be able to read sensitive data from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious DWF File:** The attack vector is a maliciously crafted DWF file. The user must open this malicious file using an affected Autodesk product to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted DWF file.
- They must trick a user into opening this malicious file using a vulnerable version of Autodesk software (specifically the Windows versions) to trigger the exploit, as user interaction is required.

**Affected Products:**

- Autodesk AutoCAD (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD Architecture (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD Electrical (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD Mechanical (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD MEP (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD Plant 3D (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk Civil 3D (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk Advance Steel (versions 2025, 2024)
- Autodesk AutoCAD LT (versions 2025, 2024)
- DWG TrueView (versions 2025, 2024)

**Mitigated Versions:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 2025.1 and 2024.1.6 of the affected products.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory specifically mentions that the vulnerability only affects Windows versions of the software.
- The exploit requires user interaction, as a user must open the malicious DWF file.
- Fixes for some products (AutoCAD, Advance Steel, Civil 3D, and specialized toolsets) need to install specific product updates and are not included in the toolset updates.
