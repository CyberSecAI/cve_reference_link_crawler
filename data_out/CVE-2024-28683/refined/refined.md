The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28683.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in DedeCMS v5.7 due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when creating a file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "create file" component of DedeCMS v5.7. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how user-supplied data is handled when a file is created via a web interface. The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection of a malicious `<img onerror="alert(1)" src="1" />` tag, which triggers the execution of JavaScript code upon rendering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to interact with the "create file" feature in DedeCMS v5.7. This likely means that the attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the file creation mechanism, and depending on its design, it may require prior authentication or be available for unauthenticated users.
