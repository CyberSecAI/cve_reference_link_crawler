Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the `text` parameter of the `/php/manage_customer.php` endpoint. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL code directly into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Specifically, it is a time-based blind SQL injection. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or sanitize the input received through the `text` parameter within the query to the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass normal access controls and retrieve sensitive information from the database.
*   **System Disruption:** The attacker can potentially modify or delete data, leading to system instability or data corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (potential):** While not explicitly mentioned, depending on the database user privileges and configuration, SQL injection can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/php/manage_customer.php` endpoint.
*   **`text` Parameter Manipulation:**  The attack vector is the `text` parameter of the request URL which is vulnerable to injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:**  The attacker needs to know the specific URL and parameter that are vulnerable.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and techniques to craft the malicious payloads.

**Additional details:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using the `SLEEP()` function.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Pharmacy Management System."
*   The vulnerability is considered "CRITICAL" severity.
*   The vulnerability is unpatched at the time of the report.
