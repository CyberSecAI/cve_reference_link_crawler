Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30078

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability due to insecure handling of user-controlled input passed to a `system` call. Specifically, the variables `ipv6_wan_ipaddr`, `ipv6_lan_ipaddr`, `ipv6_wan_length`, and `ipv6_lan_length` are used in a `sprintf` function using the format string `%s`, and then passed to the `system` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection vulnerability. The lack of proper sanitization of the four mentioned variables before they are used in a `system` call allows for arbitrary code execution by injecting shell commands.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability falls under the category of insecure permissions leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected router.
- **Full System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can lead to full compromise of the router, including but not limited to, the ability to join the router to a botnet, expose sensitive data on the internal network, or even brick the router.
- **Remote Access:** Using the provided PoC, an attacker can open a telnet session, gaining direct access to the routerâ€™s shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Authenticated Attacks:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability through the router's web interface by sending a crafted `POST` request to `ipv6_fix.cgi`.
- **Web Interface (Specific Page):** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits `http://192.168.1.1/IPV6_fixed.htm` and submits a modified request via `ipv6_fix.cgi`.
- **Manipulated POST Request Parameters:** The attack vector specifically involves manipulating the `ipv6_wan_ipaddr`, `ipv6_lan_ipaddr`, `ipv6_wan_length`, or `ipv6_lan_length` parameters within the `POST` request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface using valid credentials. The provided PoC shows a basic authentication of `admin:admin1`.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Netgear R6200\_v2
- Netgear R6300\_v2
- All firmware versions, including the latest R6200v2-V1.0.3.12\_10.1.11 and R6300v2-V1.0.4.52\_10.0.93

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `/sbin/acos_service` binary.
- The vulnerable code is located where the variables mentioned above are passed to a `sprintf` function, and then the formatted string is passed to the `system` call.

**PoC Explanation:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject the command `$(telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1235 -b 0.0.0.0)` through the `ipv6_wan_ipaddr` parameter. The server then executes this, opening a telnet shell, allowing for arbitrary command execution.
- Similar exploitation is possible using the other three parameters, `ipv6_lan_ipaddr`, `ipv6_wan_length`, and `ipv6_lan_length`.

This is a high-severity vulnerability due to the potential for complete compromise of the affected devices and remote execution of arbitrary commands.
