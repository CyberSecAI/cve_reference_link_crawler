- This message further clarifies that the fix for CVE-2024-35867 is not in the 5.10.y branch, as determined by the `dyad` tool output. The dyad tool produces a list of "vulnerable:fixed" pairs of version and git ids.

Based on the information available, it seems that CVE-2024-35867 is **UNRELATED** to the Linux kernel 5.10 as the vulnerable code is not present in that branch.
