- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A `DATA_FRAG` submessage with an invalid payload size can lead to a bad-free error due to an attempt to free uninitialized memory. Specifically, when processing a `DATA_FRAG` submessage, if the `payload_size` is invalid, the `serializedPayload` member of the `CacheChange_t` object (`ch`) is not properly initialized. This leads to a double free or use-after-free when the object is later deallocated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper memory management, specifically a bad-free error due to the destructor freeing uninitialized memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote termination of the Fast-DDS process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted `DATA_FRAG` submessage with an invalid payload size over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Fast-DDS process, with the ability to send UDP packets to it.
