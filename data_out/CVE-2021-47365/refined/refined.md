The provided content relates to a page leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's afs filesystem.

**Root cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing page reference cleanup in the `afs_extend_writeback()` function. This function attempts to extend a writeback operation by speculatively acquiring page references. However, it fails to release these references when it encounters a page that cannot be immediately written back. This issue arose due to a change from `find_get_pages_contig()` to xarray scanning which only retrieves one page at a time, removing a cleanup loop that was present in the former.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Page leak: The code fails to release page references when the writeback operation cannot be extended, leading to a memory leak.
- Incorrect resource management:  The speculative acquisition of page references without proper cleanup mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: The page leak can lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing system instability or denial of service. The provided information indicates a leak of ~4GiB of RAM with each run of a specific test case.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `afs_extend_writeback()` function through write operations on an afs filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger write operations on an AFS filesystem.
