- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device does not effectively defend against malicious external interference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Laser command injection vulnerability. The device fails to properly handle external malicious interference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow voice commands to be executed on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers need to be within visual distance of the device. Malicious laser interference is used to inject commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within visual distance of the targeted device to exploit the vulnerability, also the attacker must have means to generate malicious laser interference.
