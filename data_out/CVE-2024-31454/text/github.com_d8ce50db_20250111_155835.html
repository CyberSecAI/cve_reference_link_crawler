## Description

### Difference from vulnerability number [GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6)

This vulnerability allows you to violate the integrity of a file that is uploaded by another user. In this case, additional files are not loaded into the file bucket. Violation of integrity at the level of individual files. While the vulnerability with the number [GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6) allows you to violate the integrity of a file bucket without violating the integrity of files uploaded by other users. Thus, vulnerabilities are reproduced differently, require different security recommendations and affect different objects of the application’s business logic.

### Summary

The absence of restrictions on the endpoint, which is designed for uploading files, allows an attacker who received the id of a file distribution to change the files that are in this distribution.

### Details

Vulnerable endpoint: PATCH /files/{{id}}

### PoC

1. Create a file distribution.
2. Go to the link address for downloading files and download the file (in this case, the attacker receives the file id from the download request).
3. Send a PATCH /files/{{id}} request with arbitrary content in the request body.

Thus, the file with the specified id will be changed. What the attacker specifies in the body of the request will be added to the end of the original content. In the future, users will download the modified file.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to influence those users who come to the file distribution after him and slip the victim files with a malicious or phishing signature.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
