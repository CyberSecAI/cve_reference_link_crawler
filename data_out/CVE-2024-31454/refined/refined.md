The provided content relates to CVE-2024-31454.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of restrictions on the file upload endpoint. Specifically, the `PATCH /files/{{id}}` endpoint allows an attacker, who knows the ID of a file distribution, to modify the contents of files within that distribution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Modification:** The core issue is the absence of proper access controls on the `PATCH /files/{{id}}` endpoint. This allows unauthorized users to modify existing files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The endpoint does not validate or sanitize the content provided in the request body, leading to arbitrary data being appended to the files.
- **Missing Integrity Checks:** There are no mechanisms to prevent or detect unauthorized modifications to the uploaded files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **File Integrity Violation:** An attacker can alter the contents of files that are part of a file distribution.
- **Malicious Content Injection:** The attacker can inject malicious or phishing content into the files, potentially affecting users who download the modified files.
- **Supply Chain Risk:** Users who download the modified files might be exposed to malware or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **Direct Endpoint Manipulation:** The attacker uses the `PATCH /files/{{id}}` endpoint to alter file contents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of File Distribution ID:** The attacker must obtain the ID of the file distribution to exploit the vulnerability. This ID can be obtained from the file download link.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is different from `GHSA-xg8v-m2mh-45m6` because it allows for modification of individual files within a distribution rather than the entire bucket.
- The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.2.0 by introducing a locking mechanism to prevent modification once upload is completed.
- The fix included changes in `app/src/Upload/store/upload.js`, `lib/db.js` and `lib/endpoints.js`. These changes implemented bucket locking based on `sid`, and restricted file modification after the upload is complete.
