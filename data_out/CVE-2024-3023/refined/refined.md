Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3023:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling admin settings within the AnnounceKit WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious activities
* The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on availability.
