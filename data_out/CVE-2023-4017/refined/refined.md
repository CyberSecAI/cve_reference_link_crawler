  "CVE-2023-4017": {
    "Description": "The Goya theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘attra-color’, 'attra-size', and 'product-cata' parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the ‘attra-color’, 'attra-size', and 'product-cata' parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary web scripts can be injected and executed in a user's browser if they are tricked into clicking a malicious link. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the vulnerable parameters with injected JavaScript and tricking a user into clicking on the link.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link that a user will click on. No authentication is required for the attack."
