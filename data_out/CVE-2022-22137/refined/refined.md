- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of buffer size when processing a malformed IOCA file. Specifically, when the `size_Y` value in the file is null, a zero-byte allocation occurs for the `table_mys_rgb` array and later when `IGDIBRunEnds::delete_table_mys_rbg_ptr` is called, the code attempts to free an uninitialized pointer within this array leading to an arbitrary free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect buffer size calculation, leading to a zero-byte allocation and use of uninitialized memory in subsequent free operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can trigger an arbitrary free which can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted IOCA file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are required.
