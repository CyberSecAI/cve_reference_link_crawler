Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way iTerm2 handles specific control sequences, particularly those related to "Tmux integration" and "Request upload" features. These features inject linefeeds and potentially other data into the standard input (stdin) of the shell or program running within the terminal. This behavior, combined with the interpretation of specific escape sequences, allows for the injection of commands into the shell's command line.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** iTerm2 doesn't properly sanitize terminal output, allowing malicious escape sequences to be interpreted by the terminal, potentially injecting arbitrary commands into the shell's input.
- **In-band Control Encoding:** The fundamental weakness lies in the in-band encoding of control functions, where commands and data are mixed. This makes it difficult to differentiate between legitimate terminal output and malicious control sequences.
- **Linefeed Injection:** The tmux integration and request upload features of iTerm2 inject linefeeds to stdin, which can trigger execution of commands after the current one.
- **Abuse of DECRQSS and other escape sequences:** Attackers can use DECRQSS (Request Status String), XTReportSGR (Report selected graphic rendition), DSR (Device Status Report) and other escape sequences to inject arbitrary strings into the command line.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary remote code execution by crafting malicious terminal output. This could include launching applications, executing shell commands, or performing other unauthorized actions.
- **Command Injection:** The injected commands are executed in the context of the user running the terminal, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to user resources.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the executed commands, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Output:** The primary attack vector is via specially crafted terminal output generated by a program or remote host.
- **Terminal Emulators:** The vulnerability exists in the iTerm2 terminal emulator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Output Stream:** The attacker must have control over the output stream that iTerm2 is displaying. This could be a remote server, a script, or any application that prints to the terminal.
- **Knowledge of Escape Sequences:** The attacker needs to be knowledgeable about VT100 escape sequences and how iTerm2 handles them to craft effective payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided blog post details a novel exploit that doesn't require the attacker to deliver additional files. It relies on using the output itself to construct the command.
- The exploit takes advantage of how the shell interprets certain escape sequences, for example, by using `m4` to run system commands.
- The vulnerability is not easily patched due to the nature of the in-band encoding.
- The exploit provided is an example demonstrating how `m4` built-in command can be used to open the calculator app.
- The root of the problem is the legacy standard of terminals that mix control characters with data.

**Fix:**
The commit logs provided also point to a fix for this vulnerability, as described in the `Fix ReportUpload vulnerability` commit message. The fix involved sanitizing title reports by removing risky characters. Additionally, the DECSCPP and DECNLS escape sequences were removed.
