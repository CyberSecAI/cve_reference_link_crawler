# Introduction

> *Comodo Antivirus has a quarantine flaw that allows privilege escalation. Exploitation uses an NTFS directory junction to restore a malicious DLL from quarantine into the System32 folder. By overwriting/putting a DLL which is used by a SYSTEM level process, one can elevate his/her privileges.*
>
> *I’m disclosing this vulnerability after waiting them for 60 days. They didn’t respond my emails.*

# Description of the Vulnerability

1. Title: Comodo Antivirus Local Privilege Escalation Through Insecure File Move
2. Product: Comodo Antivirus
3. Version: 12.2.2.8012 (Latest Version on June 2022)
4. Homepage: <https://antivirus.comodo.com/>
5. Test Platform: Windows 10 19044

![]()

Comodo Antivirus has a service called **“Comodo Internet Security Helper Service”** which runs as the **SYSTEM**.

![]()

One of the jobs that this service does is the quarantine feature.

When a malicious file is detected, it is first quarantined by the application with the default settings. In order to restore this malicious file, the user can unblock it from the unblock applications tab. While restoring the file, **the file is moved to its older location via SYSTEM privileges by the cmdagent.exe which is the process of that service**. For example, an EICAR file (test.txt in the screenshot) was moved to its original location by this process.

![]()

Because of this, a non-admin user can put any file he/she wants to privileged locations like System32 by abusing the NTFS junctions. After that, he/she can use this ability to escalate his/her privileges to SYSTEM by overwriting/putting malicious DLLs under the System32 folder to abuse DLL Search Order.

To illustrate, I used the [symboliclink-testing-tools](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools) toolkit from James Forshaw.

To write an example file under the System32 directory from a low-privileged account, first, we can create a directory and a file on the Desktop. Then we can put Eicar content to this file to trigger the quarantine feature. After that, Comodo Antivirus detects this file and quarantines it.

When the file is in the quarantine, we can create an NTFS junction by using the CreateMountPoint tool from our symbolic link toolkit. **We can arrange this NTFS junction so that it redirects any write operation for the directory on the Desktop to the System32 directory.** When the NTFS junction is ready, if we restore the file, we can realize that it is now placed under the System32 directory.

I showed these steps in a Youtube video. You can watch it below. To escalate privilege, you can overwrite or put a malicious DLL, whose name is the same as a DLL imported by a SERVICE level process, under the System32 folder.

## What is an Antivirus

Antiviruses are powerful pieces of software designed to detect, stop, and remove malware from computers. With vulnerabilities constantly emerging in operating systems, browsers, add-ons, and other programs, an antivirus is an essential security component for home users.

## How Does Antivirus Software Work?

Whenever you download or launch a file, an antivirus program scans the file for malware. Most modern antivirus programs feature multiple scanning detection processes. The most basic detection process is known as specific detection. This is what most people think of when they think about how an antivirus works. Specific detection works by scanning a file for a specific set of characteristics and checking these characteristics against a known list of malware. This process is executed quickly and is an essential feature of an [antivirus software](https://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/antivirus.php), but it is also easy for cybercriminals to evade. Like a wanted outlaw in the old west, a cybercriminal can disguise a piece of malware to avoid detection. Modify the code slightly, and the malware is rendered undetectable.

Comodo Antivirus also uses heuristic detection and containment to ensure that even unknown malware cannot compromise our users’ computers. Heuristic detection describes the method of analyzing the code of a file to determine if it contains code commonly found in malware. If suspicious code is detected then the antivirus deletes the file or recommends it for containment. Files run in Comodo containment are kept in a sandbox environment, separate from your operating system. Heuristics is about detecting virus-like behavior or attributes rather than looking for a precise virus signature that matches a signature on the virus blacklist.

## Best Antivirus Software for Computer and Laptop

Laptops face all the same threats as desktops, from trojans, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware, etc. But in addition to these threats, laptops also face a unique vulnerability to plug-in attacks. Laptops running Windows, macOS, and Linux are all vulnerable to these attacks, which are executed by a cybercriminal compromising an unattended machine through a charger, docking station, or USB port.

To prevent falling victim to these types of attacks, users must install a laptop antivirus bundle that isolates unknown files entering the system. Comodo Antivirus’s containment technology keeps your laptop protected from all types of attacks by automatically isolating all unknown files in a secure virtual environment, where it cannot hard your computer.

Keep your laptop and desktop computer protected from all threats

## Security Software for Android Mobile and Tablet?

Android viruses have been making headlines recently. In September 2019, it was reported that a trojan called “the Joker” had been detected in 24 apps in the Google Play Store and had been downloaded nearly half a million times. There have even been confirmed reports of viruses disguised as fake antivirus apps making their way onto the Google Play Store and receiving over 100,000 downloads. As Android becomes more popular and more versions of the OS appear, Android phones and tablets become more vulnerable to infection, and the importance of protecting your device becomes more essential.

### Do I Need Antivirus for Android

The best way to protect your Android device from malware is by installing an antivirus from a trusted provider. Comodo offers a mobile security solution for Android-based mobile devices through Comodo Mobile Security (CMS). CMS protects your Android devices against viruses, unsafe apps, potentially risky settings and even from theft, and is available for free.

### Benefits of Using Antivirus for Android Devices

Because Android’s operating system relies on an open source code that allows end users and manufacturers to modify the operating system, Androids phones and tablets are more susceptible to threats than iOS phones and tablets. Therefore, it is essential for android users to download a trusted antivirus app that scans and detects viruses, filters out spam texts and calls, optimizes your system, protects against physical theft of your device, monitors traffic, and advises you on your privacy. Comodo Mobile Security for Android does all this, and is available for free.

### Antivirus for Windows Computer

Windows Defender is improving, but it’s still far from perfect. You should supplement your PC’s defense with a robust antivirus tool

### Best Antivirus for Windows Devices

The best antivirus for Windows devices should have features that keep your Windows PC protected against holes that Windows Defender leaves. Features like anti-spam, adware prevention, and safe browsing are essential for Windows users.

### Do You Need Antivirus for Windows 10?

Windows Defender is a good tool that provides more than baseline protection, but it has been shown by AV Comparatives and other tests to lag behind other antivirus programs when it comes to protecting your PC, and lacks some essential security features, including password managers. To ensure complete protection, relying on Windows Defender is not enough. An additional program, like [Comodo Antivirus for Windows 10](https://antivirus.comodo.com/antivirus-for-windows-10/), is necessary to cover the gaps that Windows Defender leaves.

### Antivirus Software for Windows 10

Windows Defender has been shown to lag slightly behind industry leading AV products. An effective antivirus for Windows 10 must be able to supplement Window’s built-in security features and cover any holes they leave. Essential features of an effective windows antivirus that Windows Defender does not provide, include anti-spam, safe browsing, email protection, VPN service, and live support. Comodo Antivirus provides all these features and more for only $29.99/year, making it an ideal antivirus to keep your PC protected.

### Antivirus for Windows 8

You get the best security suite in the industry, including an enterprise-level packet filtering [firewall](https://personalfirewall.comodo.com/what-is-firewall.php), Windows antivirus protection with Defense+ and Auto Sandbox technology and a highly advanced host intrusion prevention system (HIPS).

### Antivirus for Windows 7

Although mainstream support for Windows 7 ended in 2015, 31% of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 7, and Windows 7 continues to be the most used version in many countries. Microsoft recently warned users that security updates for Windows 7 will come to an end as of January 14, 2020. Therefore, it is essential for Windows 7 users to install an antivirus from a trusted security provider to keep their computers and sensitive information safe.

Equipped with cutting-edge technology like Containment, HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System), Default Deny Platform and Defense+ Approach, [Comodo Antivirus for Windows 7](https://antivirus.comodo.com/antivirus-for-windows-7/) provides complete protection against various security threats. And it’s available for only $29.99/year. No need for Microsoft's assistance. No need to upgrade to Windows 10. Just download Comodo Windows 7 Antivirus, and let us handle the rest.

### Antivirus for Linux

Malware for Linux is much less common than malware for Windows, but does this mean that Linux operating systems are completely safe from viruses? Not necessarily. Linux systems can still suffer ill effects from malware and spam. Comodo Antivirus for Linux provides important features that you won’t get elsewhere, including antispam, email security, real-time behaviour analysis, and an on-access scanner.
