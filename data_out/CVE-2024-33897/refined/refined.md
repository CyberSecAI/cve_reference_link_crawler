{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-33897",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Cosy+ device specifies the common name (CN) of the certificate in the certificate signing request (CSR). This CN is used by the Talk2M platform to assign the OpenVPN session to the corresponding account. An attacker with root access to a Cosy+ device can manipulate the CSR, inserting a foreign device's serial number as the CN, and obtain a valid signed certificate for that device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)"
    ],
    "impact": "A compromised Cosy+ device can be used to request a Certificate Signing Request from Talk2m for another device. This results in the attacker being able to hijack the VPN session of the targeted device, leading to several consequences such as:\n\t* Impacting the accessibility of the original device.\n\t* Attacking the Talk2M-connected user device via the VPN connection.\n\t* Eavesdropping and manipulating the network communication of connected users.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An attacker with root access to a Cosy+ device crafts a malicious CSR with a foreign device's serial number as the common name (CN), sends it to the Talk2M API and receives a signed certificate which then allows the attacker to hijack the VPN session of the targeted device."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "The attacker requires root access to a Cosy+ device to manipulate the CSR and retrieve the signed certificate",
      "The attacker requires knowledge of a victim's Cosy+ device serial number"
    ]
