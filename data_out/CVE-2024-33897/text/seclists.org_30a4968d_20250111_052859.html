I believe the problem lies elsewhere. The root cause is an
architectural or design problem.

Ewon Cosy+ should probably be using a protocol like Simple Certificate
Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) or Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST),
and not rolling their own scheme. Also see discussions like
<<https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/pkix/X94XpFJA5sKKkLTVkOYXL_dv8t4/>>
