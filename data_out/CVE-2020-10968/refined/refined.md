Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10968:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly mentions CVE-2020-10968, specifically stating it is related to:
  - FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.4
  - The interaction between serialization gadgets and typing
  - `org.aoju.bus.proxy.provider.remoting.RmiProvider`

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and polymorphic typing within the FasterXML jackson-databind library. This allows for the exploitation of "gadget" classes.
    *   Specifically the `org.aoju.bus.proxy.provider.remoting.RmiProvider` is mentioned as a gadget class.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Serialization Gadgets:** The presence of "gadget" classes in the classpath. These classes, when instantiated and modified via setters/field assignments during deserialization, perform unintended side effects.
    *   **Polymorphic Type Handling:**  Specifically with nominal type of `java.lang.Object` (or one of small number of “permissive” tag interfaces; `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`). This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary class names for instantiation during deserialization.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** Jackson's deserialization process does not properly validate or block potentially harmful class names specified in the JSON input.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by manipulating the types and properties of objects during deserialization.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through sending maliciously crafted JSON payloads to a server using Jackson for deserialization.
    *   Specifically, sending a specially crafted JSON that includes the name of a “gadget” class that exists within the server's classpath with setter methods that can be leveraged.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send a custom JSON payload to the vulnerable system.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of vulnerable "gadget" classes that exist within the classpath of the target application as well as knowledge on how to exploit them.

*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The provided medium.com article gives a detailed background on how Jackson-based gadget exploits work, describing the prerequisites and implications.
    *   The advisory from netapp.com confirms that multiple NetApp products are affected by this CVE, specifically referencing FasterXML jackson-databind versions prior to 2.9.10.4 and that a successful attack could lead to sensitive information disclosure, addition/modification of data or DoS.
    *   The oracle.com advisory lists affected components and versions, and states that a security alert for Oracle WebLogic Server (CVE-2020-14750) is included in that update, highlighting the threat from these types of vulnerabilities.
    *   The github.com content refers to the fix applied to address CVE-2020-10968 and related vulnerabilities in version 2.9.10.4 of jackson-databind.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-10968 is a critical vulnerability in FasterXML jackson-databind that arises from improper handling of serialization gadgets during polymorphic deserialization. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious JSON data containing the name of a gadget class, thereby achieving remote code execution, denial of service, or data disclosure on the affected system. The vulnerability is primarily addressed in Jackson versions >= 2.9.10.4
