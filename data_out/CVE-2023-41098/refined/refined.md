The provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the dashboard edit functionality of the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) application. The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the `DashboardsController.php` file, specifically the widget ID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: User-supplied data, likely the `id` parameter, is not properly sanitized before being used in the application's output when editing a dashboard, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Redirecting to malicious websites
  - Defacement of the user interface
  - Other malicious activities performed in the context of the victim's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted request when editing a dashboard that includes malicious JavaScript code in the widget's ID parameter (`id`). This malicious input is then reflected back to the user, resulting in the execution of the injected script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL or HTTP request that contains malicious JavaScript in the widget ID parameter of the dashboard edit functionality.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on this crafted link or otherwise trigger the malicious request via the browser.
- No specific privileges are mentioned in the provided content, but the user would need to be logged into the MISP application.
