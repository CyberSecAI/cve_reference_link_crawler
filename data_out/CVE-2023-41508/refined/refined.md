Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a hard-coded default administrator username ("admin") and password ("password") in Super Store Finder v3.6. This default credential was not changeable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hard-coded Credentials:** The application ships with a default, unchangeable username/password combination.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The hardcoded credentials bypass the authentication mechanism.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The included screenshots show a stored XSS vulnerability, indicating a lack of input validation within the admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel.
- **Data Breach:** Potential for complete data compromise, modification, or exfiltration
- **Code Execution:** The ability to inject stored XSS could lead to further exploitation and code execution on the server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains full administrative privileges.
- **Denial of Service:** The provided CVSS vector and description implies the potential to disrupt the application's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely via the application's login page.
- **Credentials Brute Forcing**: While the username and password are known, the vulnerability allows direct login without any attempts to bypass security checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the application's login page over the network.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the hardcoded "admin/password" credentials for Super Store Finder v3.6.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content also highlights the patch notes for version 3.7, which mentions fixing this vulnerability by upgrading the admin login library, removing predefined values, and other security updates.
