- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into a website. This malicious script would then be executed when other users visit the affected page, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or theft of user data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is introduced through the plugin's handling of user-provided input. An attacker could inject malicious scripts through these input fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need to be a contributor to inject malicious scripts.
