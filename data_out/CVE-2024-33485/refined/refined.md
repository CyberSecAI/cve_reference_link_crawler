The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `login.php` file of the "CASAP Automated Enrollment System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `login.php` file retrieves user input from the POST element without proper sanitization or validation. This unsanitized input is then used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization before being used in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Data breach: Sensitive information from the database can be accessed and potentially exfiltrated.
- Privilege escalation: If the database user has DBA privileges, the attacker could potentially gain control of the server host.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `login.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The specific vulnerable file is `login.php` in the `Final` directory.
- The vulnerability is located on line 4 (input retrieval) and line 21 (database query) of the file.
- A sample payload and HTTP request (using Burp Suite) are provided to demonstrate the exploit.
- The attacker can retrieve database names by exploiting this vulnerability.
