# **Insyde's Security Pledge**

#

![](/sites/default/files/page_images/insyde-pledge-3.jpg)

Since our inception 20 years ago, security has been essential. Hundreds of OEMs and ODM partners have trusted us with enabling the platforms that form the foundation of their products, knowing we share their commitment to make them secure. Product security is a top priority with our company and an area of focus that we continue to improve upon every day.

* We sit on the security review team of the industry’s leading firmware standards body; the UEFI Security Response Team.
* We have internal product security experts that drive our Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process within our BIOS and BMC firmware teams and evaluate existing and emerging threats.
* We issue regular and timely security alert bulletins when mitigations to vulnerabilities are discovered.
* We work closely with all of our silicon vendor partners to ensure the timely and critical delivery of microcode updates and other patches.

At Insyde, we work with the broader industry to identify, report, mitigate and disclose security vulnerabilities. We support you, our customers and partners, in closing the door to anything which compromises the security or privacy in your platforms. We take this role seriously, because if your firmware is not secure, your product is not secure.

This is our pledge to you. If you have any questions about Insyde Software’s commitment to security, I urge you to reach out to us at security.report@insyde.com

**Tim Lewis, Chief Technology Officer**
