The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-29863.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the QlikView installer executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability is a race condition in the QlikView installer, which allows a low-privileged user to potentially execute code with administrator privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a local low-privileged user to escalate their privileges to that of a Windows Administrator, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. A user needs to have existing access to the Windows environment where QlikView is running, or access to the QlikView plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have existing low-privilege access to the system where QlikView is installed, or access to the QlikView plugin. No network access is required for exploitation.
