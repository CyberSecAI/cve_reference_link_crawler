### Summary
The provided content indicates a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress plugin "SliceWP Affiliates", specifically in versions up to and including 1.1.20. The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of URLs using `remove_query_arg` without proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into pages that will execute if a user clicks a crafted link.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is the use of `remove_query_arg` on URLs without adequate escaping. This function removes specified query parameters from a URL, but in the vulnerable code, the resulting URL was not properly sanitized before being outputted to the web page. This lack of escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code by crafting a URL with specific query parameters.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities
The core vulnerability is a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, categorized as an **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation** vulnerability.

### Impact of exploitation
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
*   **Session hijacking:** An attacker might be able to steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Redirects:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify content or deface the target website.
*   **Information theft:** Malicious scripts could steal sensitive information.
*   **Malware delivery:** The injected code could redirect to websites hosting malware.

### Attack vectors
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code within query parameters.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a victim into clicking the specially crafted URL.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Victim interaction:** The attacker must trick a victim into clicking a malicious link.

### Technical Details
The vulnerable code is located in the `class-list-table-commissions.php`, `class-list-table-visits.php`, and `class-list-table-payments.php` files. The files use `remove_query_arg` without proper sanitization and escaping when constructing URLs, particularly in the reset links of the table. The plugin has been updated to version 1.1.21 which contains a fix for the issue.
