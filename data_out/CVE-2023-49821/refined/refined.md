- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LiveChat WordPress plugin (versions <= 4.5.15) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page that will cause a request to be sent to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to perform an action (click a link, visit a malicious page) to trigger the vulnerable functionality in the plugin. The user must be logged into the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
