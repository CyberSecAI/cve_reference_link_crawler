  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-27153",
      "root_cause": "Local Privilege Escalation and Remote Code Execution using CISSM",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `cissm` program, which runs as root, executes commands based on the `/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/common/bin/ssm.xml` file. This XML file has insecure permissions (777), allowing modification by an attacker, which leads to execution of malicious commands with root privileges.",
         "The configuration file is also reachable by remote attacker via file upload"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve local privilege escalation by modifying the `ssm.xml` file to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, or overwrite `ssm.xml` to make system changes. Remote code execution is possible by overwriting `ssm.xml` via an insecure upload functionality.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system to modify `/home/SYSROM_SRC/build/common/bin/ssm.xml`." ,
        "Remote access with insecure file upload to overwrite the configuration file."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Local file write access or remote file upload ability through another vulnerability"
