- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the BEAR plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (subscriber) can perform actions that they are not authorized to do. The specific impact of this varies but generally could allow access to sensitive data or modification of settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a subscriber by triggering the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a registered subscriber.
