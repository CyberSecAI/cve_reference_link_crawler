- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to trick a user's browser into sending malicious requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially add or modify home page product deals without the user's consent or knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of content or other administrative actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to a vulnerable endpoint. The victim needs to be authenticated with the target application and visit the malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file and have a victim visit it while they are authenticated to the target application. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
