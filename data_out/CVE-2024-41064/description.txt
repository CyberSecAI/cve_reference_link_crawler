In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/eeh: avoid possible crash when edev->pdev changes

If a PCI device is removed during eeh_pe_report_edev(), edev->pdev
will change and can cause a crash, hold the PCI rescan/remove lock
while taking a copy of edev->pdev->bus.
