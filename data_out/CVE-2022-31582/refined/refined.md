Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-315xx (Multiple)

**Root Cause:** Unsafe usage of the Flask `send_file` function, which allows absolute path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  * **CWE-22 (Path Traversal):** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths before passing them to the `send_file` function. This allows an attacker to specify an absolute path to a file on the server, bypassing intended access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

  *   **Confidentiality:** An attacker can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files or application source code.
  *   **Availability:** Although generally rated as low, in some cases, repeated requests of large files could potentially lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
  * **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
  * The attacker manipulates variables to reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences or by using absolute file paths. The Flask `send_file` function then processes this unsanitized path, leading to file access outside the web root directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
 * **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to make network requests to the vulnerable web application.
 * **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**
  * The vulnerability stems from the direct use of user-supplied input within the `send_file` function of the Flask framework. Specifically, the `filename` parameter in `send_file` is not properly validated or sanitized, which allows for path traversal attacks.
  * The vulnerability occurs due to the following code pattern (from multiple repositories):
     *   `flask.send_file(filename)` where `filename` is directly or indirectly influenced by user-provided input.
     * Sometimes unsafe usage of  `os.path.join`  is also the root cause.
  * A proof of concept (PoC) attack vector would be using `curl --path-as-is 'http://<domain>/download//../../../../etc/passwd'` to access files on the server.

**Remediation:**
 * The primary recommendation is to avoid passing untrusted data directly to `flask.send_file`.
 * Use `flask.safe_join` to validate user-supplied paths or replace `flask.send_file` with `flask.send_from_directory`.
*   Use `werkzeug.utils.safe_join`

**Additional Notes:**

   *   The vulnerability was discovered using code analysis tools like CodeQL.
   *   Many of the affected projects appear to be personal or academic projects, and do not have a well-defined release cycle or a large user base.
   *   There seems to be discussion about whether CVEs should be assigned to small or personal projects, but that the vulnerability pattern itself is valid.
   *  The issue was discovered by an external security researcher, and the fixes were made through a mix of direct commits and pull requests.
   * The vulnerability was found using *[CodeQL by Github](https://codeql.github.com/)*.
   * There was a discussion about the scope and appropriate use of CVEs, indicating that some felt that assigning CVEs to every instance of the vulnerability was too noisy, but it was also acknowledged that the reported pattern was indeed a valid vulnerability.
    * The vulnerability exists in the use of `os.path.join` since it is unsafe for use with untrusted input.
