|  | CVE-2024-33809 |
|  | [PRODUCT] |
|  | PingCAP TiDB |
|  | [VERSION] |
|  | =v7.5.1 |
|  | [PROBLEM TYPE] |
|  | buffer overflow |
|  | [DESCRIPTION] |
|  | PingCAP TiDB v7.5.1 was discovered to contain a buffer overflow vulnerability, |
|  | which could lead to database crashes and denial of service attacks. |
|  | The panic happens when get string from a column while the offset field in the |
|  | column is not initialized, which leads to the index out of range. The offset |
|  | field in the column should have been initialized in HashJoin\_30, but joiner.go:976 |
|  | could not do this. Tidb appends the inner to chkForJoin, which causes the |
|  | non-initialization of offset field in the column. It's the optimizer who fails |
|  | to set correct information in executor leads to the panic. |
