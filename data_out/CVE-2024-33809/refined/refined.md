Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in PingCAP TiDB v7.5.1. Specifically, it occurs during the process of retrieving string data from a column where the offset field has not been properly initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uninitialized offset field:**  The `offset` field within a column's data structure is not initialized correctly in certain scenarios during the `HashJoin_30` operation. This leads to the program attempting to access memory at an invalid address.
- **Incorrect initialization logic:** The `joiner.go:976` logic fails to initialize the offset field properly when the inner table data is appended to `chkForJoin`, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Optimizer failure:** The query optimizer fails to set the correct information in the executor, which ultimately contributes to the uninitialized offset issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database crashes:** The primary impact is database crashes due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Denial of service:** Repeated crashes can result in a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the database's availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Query:** The vulnerability can be triggered by executing a specific SQL query, crafted to exploit the join operation's logic when handling inner table data.
- The provided `error.sql` (in the provided links) demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database user privileges:** An attacker needs to be able to execute queries against the TiDB database.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable query patterns:** The attacker needs to know or discover the specific query patterns that trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects TiDB versions including 5.4.x, 6.1.x, 6.5.x, 7.1.x, 7.5.x and 8.1.x
