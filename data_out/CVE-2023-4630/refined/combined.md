# GitLab Security Release: 16.3.1, 16.2.5, and 16.1.5

Learn more about GitLab Security Release: 16.3.1, 16.2.5, and 16.1.5 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 16.3.1, 16.2.5 and 16.1.5 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version.

GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. For more information, you can visit our [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/). You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/). In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100) 30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are dedicated to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers upgrade to the latest security release for their supported version. You can read more [best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.

## Privilege escalation of "external user" to internal access through group service account

An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 16.1 before 16.1.5, all versions starting from 16.2 before 16.2.5, all versions starting from 16.3 before 16.3.1. If an external user is given an owner role on any group, that external user may escalate their privileges on the instance by creating a service account in that group. This service account is not classified as external and may be used to access internal projects. This is a medium severity issue (`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`, 6.5). It is now mitigated in the latest release and is assigned [CVE-2023-3915](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3915).

## Maintainer can leak sentry token by changing the configured URL (fix bypass)

An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 11.8 before 16.1.5, all versions starting from 16.2 before 16.2.5, all versions starting from 16.3 before 16.3.1. A malicious Maintainer can, under specific circumstances, leak the sentry token by changing the configured URL in the Sentry error tracking settings page. This was as a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-4365. This is a medium severity issue (`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`, 5.5).

# Add authorization checks to import status endpoint

The [GET /api/v4/project/:ID/import](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_import_export.html#import-status) endpoint can be used by users to see information about a project import like status, errors, stats, etc.

The endpoint returns 404 if the user doesn't have permission to READ the project and 200 if the user has permission. In other words, the endpoint is available for all public projects. And for private projects only if the user has a READ permission role.

### Problem

The endpoint exposes information like `failed_relations.exception_message` and `error_message`, which can contain sensitive information, like access token or URL, if not filtered out.

For example, <https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/46692792/import> shows the import details of an imported project from GitHub.

### Solution

To ensure security, it is ideal to limit access to the endpoint only to users with import capabilities, specifically maintainers users and above. This will prevent unnecessary exposure to unauthorized users.
