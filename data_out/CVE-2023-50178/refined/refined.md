- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of client-side certificate validation when establishing secure connections, which falls under CWE-295.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the communication channel between the vulnerable FortiADC device and remote servers. This could lead to information disclosure by intercepting data transmitted.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker positioned to intercept network traffic between the FortiADC device and remote servers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the FortiADC device and the remote server. No authentication is required.
