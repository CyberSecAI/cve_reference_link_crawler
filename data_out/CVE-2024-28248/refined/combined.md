# Layer 3 Examples[](#layer-3-examples "Permalink to this heading")

The layer 3 policy establishes the base connectivity rules regarding which endpoints
can talk to each other. Layer 3 policies can be specified using the following methods:

* [Endpoints Based](#endpoints-based): This is used to describe the relationship if both
  endpoints are managed by Cilium and are thus assigned labels. The
  advantage of this method is that IP addresses are not encoded into the
  policies and the policy is completely decoupled from the addressing.
* [Services based](#services-based): This is an intermediate form between Labels and CIDR and
  makes use of the services concept in the orchestration system. A good example
  of this is the Kubernetes concept of Service endpoints which are
  automatically maintained to contain all backend IP addresses of a service.
  This allows to avoid hardcoding IP addresses into the policy even if the
  destination endpoint is not controlled by Cilium.
* [Entities Based](#entities-based): Entities are used to describe remote peers which can be
  categorized without knowing their IP addresses. This includes connectivity
  to the local host serving the endpoints or all connectivity to outside of
  the cluster.
* [Node based](#node-based): This is an extension of `remote-node` entity. Optionally nodes

  can have unique identity that can be used to allow/block access only from specific ones.
* [IP/CIDR based](#cidr-based): This is used to describe the relationship to or from external
  services if the remote peer is not an endpoint. This requires to hardcode either
  IP addresses or subnets into the policies. This construct should be used as a
  last resort as it requires stable IP or subnet assignments.
* [DNS based](#dns-based): Selects remote, non-cluster, peers using DNS names converted to
  IPs via DNS lookups. It shares all limitations of the [IP/CIDR based](#cidr-based) rules
  above. DNS information is acquired by routing DNS traffic via a proxy.
  DNS TTLs are respected.

## Endpoints Based[](#endpoints-based "Permalink to this heading")

Endpoints-based L3 policy is used to establish rules between endpoints inside
the cluster managed by Cilium. Endpoints-based L3 policies are defined by using
an [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) inside a rule to select what kind of traffic can be
received (on ingress), or sent (on egress). An empty [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) allows
all traffic. The examples below demonstrate this in further detail.

Note

**Kubernetes:** See section [Namespaces](../kubernetes/#k8s-namespaces) for details on how
the [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) applies in a Kubernetes environment with
regard to namespaces.

### Ingress[](#ingress "Permalink to this heading")

An endpoint is allowed to receive traffic from another endpoint if at least one
ingress rule exists which selects the destination endpoint with the
[Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) in the `endpointSelector` field. To restrict traffic upon
ingress to the selected endpoint, the rule selects the source endpoint with the
[Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) in the `fromEndpoints` field.

### Simple Ingress Allow[](#simple-ingress-allow "Permalink to this heading")

The following example illustrates how to use a simple ingress rule to allow
communication from endpoints with the label `role=frontend` to endpoints with
the label `role=backend`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l3-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: backend
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        role: frontend

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "l3-rule"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"backend"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromEndpoints": [
          {"matchLabels":{"role":"frontend"}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

### Ingress Allow All Endpoints[](#ingress-allow-all-endpoints "Permalink to this heading")

An empty [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) will select all endpoints, thus writing a rule that will allow
all ingress traffic to an endpoint may be done as follows:

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "allow-all-to-victim"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: victim
  ingress:
  - fromEndpoints:
    - {}

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "allow-all-to-victim"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"victim"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromEndpoints": [
          {"matchLabels":{}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

Note that while the above examples allow all ingress traffic to an endpoint, this does not
mean that all endpoints are allowed to send traffic to this endpoint per their policies.
In other words, policy must be configured on both sides (sender and receiver).

### Egress[](#egress "Permalink to this heading")

An endpoint is allowed to send traffic to another endpoint if at least one
egress rule exists which selects the destination endpoint with the
[Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) in the `endpointSelector` field. To restrict traffic upon
egress to the selected endpoint, the rule selects the destination endpoint with
the [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) in the `toEndpoints` field.

### Simple Egress Allow[](#simple-egress-allow "Permalink to this heading")

The following example illustrates how to use a simple egress rule to allow
communication to endpoints with the label `role=backend` from endpoints with
the label `role=frontend`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l3-egress-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  egress:
  - toEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        role: backend

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "l3-egress-rule"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"frontend"}},
    "egress": [{
        "toEndpoints": [
          {"matchLabels":{"role":"backend"}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

### Egress Allow All Endpoints[](#egress-allow-all-endpoints "Permalink to this heading")

An empty [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector) will select all egress endpoints from an endpoint
based on the [CiliumNetworkPolicy](../../../network/kubernetes/policy/#ciliumnetworkpolicy) namespace (`default` by default). The
following rule allows all egress traffic from endpoints with the label
`role=frontend` to all other endpoints in the same namespace:

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "allow-all-from-frontend"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  egress:
  - toEndpoints:
    - {}

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "allow-all-from-frontend"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"frontend"}},
    "egress": [{
        "toEndpoints": [
          {"matchLabels":{}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

Note that while the above examples allow all egress traffic from an endpoint, the receivers
of the egress traffic may have ingress rules that deny the traffic. In other words,
policy must be configured on both sides (sender and receiver).

### Ingress/Egress Default Deny[](#ingress-egress-default-deny "Permalink to this heading")

An endpoint can be put into the default deny mode at ingress or egress if a
rule selects the endpoint and contains the respective rule section ingress or
egress.

Note

Any rule selecting the endpoint will have this effect, this example
illustrates how to put an endpoint into default deny mode without
whitelisting other peers at the same time.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "deny-all-egress"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: restricted
  egress:
  - {}

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "deny-all-egress"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"restricted"}},
    "egress": [{}]
}]

```

### Additional Label Requirements[](#additional-label-requirements "Permalink to this heading")

It is often required to apply the principle of *separation of concern* when defining
policies. For this reason, an additional construct exists which allows to establish
base requirements for any connectivity to happen.

For this purpose, the `fromRequires` field can be used to establish label
requirements which serve as a foundation for any `fromEndpoints`
relationship. `fromRequires` is a list of additional constraints which must
be met in order for the selected endpoints to be reachable. These additional
constraints do not grant access privileges by themselves, so to allow traffic
there must also be rules which match `fromEndpoints`. The same applies for
egress policies, with `toRequires` and `toEndpoints`.

The purpose of this rule is to allow establishing base requirements such as, any
endpoint in `env=prod` can only be accessed if the source endpoint also carries
the label `env=prod`.

This example shows how to require every endpoint with the label `env=prod` to
be only accessible if the source endpoint also has the label `env=prod`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "requires-rule"
specs:
  - description: "For endpoints with env=prod, only allow if source also has label env=prod"
    endpointSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: prod
    ingress:
    - fromRequires:
      - matchLabels:
          env: prod

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "requires-rule"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"prod"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromRequires": [
          {"matchLabels":{"env":"prod"}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

This `fromRequires` rule doesn’t allow anything on its own and needs to be
combined with other rules to allow traffic. For example, when combined with the
example policy below, the endpoint with label `env=prod` will become
accessible from endpoints that have both labels `env=prod` and
`role=frontend`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "l3-rule"
specs:
  - description: "For endpoints with env=prod, allow if source also has label role=frontend"
    endpointSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: prod
    ingress:
    - fromEndpoints:
      - matchLabels:
          role: frontend

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "l3-rule"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"prod"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromEndpoints": [
            {"matchLabels":{"role":"frontend"}}
        ]
    }]
}]

```

## Services based[](#services-based "Permalink to this heading")

Note

Services based rules rules will only take effect on Kubernetes services
without a selector.

Traffic from pods to services running in your cluster can be allowed via
`toServices` statements in Egress rules. Currently Kubernetes
[Services without a Selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#services-without-selectors)
are supported when defined by their name and namespace or label selector.
For services backed by pods, use [Endpoints Based](#endpoints-based) rules on the backend pod
labels.

This example shows how to allow all endpoints with the label `id=app2`
to talk to all endpoints of kubernetes service `myservice` in kubernetes
namespace `default`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "service-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      id: app2
  egress:
  - toServices:
    - k8sService:
        serviceName: myservice
        namespace: default

```

```
[{
      "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "service-rule"}],
      "endpointSelector": {
        "matchLabels": {
          "id": "app2"
        }
      },
      "egress": [
        {
          "toServices": [
            {
              "k8sService": {
                "serviceName": "myservice",
                "namespace": "default"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
}]

```

This example shows how to allow all endpoints with the label `id=app2`
to talk to all endpoints of all kubernetes services without selectors which
have `external:yes` set as the label.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "service-labels-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      id: app2
  egress:
  - toServices:
    - k8sServiceSelector:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            external: "yes"

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "service-labels-rule"}],
    "endpointSelector": {
        "matchLabels": {
            "id": "app2"
        }
    },
    "egress": [
        {
            "toServices": [
                {
                    "k8sServiceSelector": {
                        "selector": {
                            "matchLabels": {
                                "external": "yes"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
]

```

### Limitations[](#limitations "Permalink to this heading")

`toServices` statements must not be combined with `toPorts` statements in the
same rule. If a rule combines both these statements, the policy is rejected.

## Entities Based[](#entities-based "Permalink to this heading")

`fromEntities` is used to describe the entities that can access the selected
endpoints. `toEntities` is used to describe the entities that can be accessed
by the selected endpoints.

The following entities are defined:

host

The host entity includes the local host. This also includes all
containers running in host networking mode on the local host.

remote-node

Any node in any of the connected clusters other than the local host. This
also includes all containers running in host-networking mode on remote
nodes.

kube-apiserver

The kube-apiserver entity represents the kube-apiserver in a Kubernetes
cluster. This entity represents both deployments of the kube-apiserver:
within the cluster and outside of the cluster.

ingress

The ingress entity represents the Cilium Envoy instance that handles ingress
L7 traffic. Be aware that this also applies for pod-to-pod traffic within
the same cluster when using ingress endpoints (also known as *hairpinning*).

cluster

Cluster is the logical group of all network endpoints inside of the local
cluster. This includes all Cilium-managed endpoints of the local cluster,
unmanaged endpoints in the local cluster, as well as the host,
remote-node, and init identities.

init

The init entity contains all endpoints in bootstrap phase for which the
security identity has not been resolved yet. This is typically only
observed in non-Kubernetes environments. See section
[Endpoint Lifecycle](../lifecycle/#endpoint-lifecycle) for details.

health

The health entity represents the health endpoints, used to check cluster
connectivity health. Each node managed by Cilium hosts a health endpoint.
See [Checking cluster connectivity health](../../../operations/troubleshooting/#cluster-connectivity-health) for details on health checks.

unmanaged

The unmanaged entity represents endpoints not managed by Cilium. Unmanaged
endpoints are considered part of the cluster and are included in the
cluster entity.

world

The world entity corresponds to all endpoints outside of the cluster.
Allowing to world is identical to allowing to CIDR 0.0.0.0/0. An alternative
to allowing from and to world is to define fine grained DNS or CIDR based
policies.

all

The all entity represents the combination of all known clusters as well
world and whitelists all communication.

Note

The `kube-apiserver` entity may not work for *ingress traffic* in some Kubernetes
distributions, such as Azure AKS and GCP GKE. This is due to the fact that ingress
control-plane traffic is being tunneled through worker nodes, which does not preserve
the original source IP. You may be able to use a broader `fromEntities: cluster` rule
instead. Restricting *egress traffic* via `toEntities: kube-apiserver` however is expected
to work on these Kubernetes distributions.

### Access to/from kube-apiserver[](#access-to-from-kube-apiserver "Permalink to this heading")

Allow all endpoints with the label `env=dev` to access the kube-apiserver.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "dev-to-kube-apiserver"

    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"dev"}},
    "egress": [{
        "toEntities": ["kube-apiserver"]
    }]
}]

```

### Access to/from local host[](#access-to-from-local-host "Permalink to this heading")

Allow all endpoints with the label `env=dev` to access the host that is
serving the particular endpoint.

Note

Kubernetes will automatically allow all communication from the
local host of all local endpoints. You can run the agent with the
option `--allow-localhost=policy` to disable this behavior which
will give you control over this via policy.

k8s YAMLJSON

    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"dev"}},
    "egress": [{
        "toEntities": ["host"]
    }]
}]

```

### Access to/from all nodes in the cluster (or clustermesh)[](#access-to-from-all-nodes-in-the-cluster-or-clustermesh "Permalink to this heading")

Allow all endpoints with the label `env=dev` to receive traffic from any host
in the cluster that Cilium is running on.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:

  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
      - host
      - remote-node

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "to-dev-from-nodes-in-cluster"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"dev"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromEntities": [
            "host",
            "remote-node"
        ]
    }]
}]

```

### Access to/from outside cluster[](#access-to-from-outside-cluster "Permalink to this heading")

This example shows how to enable access from outside of the cluster to all
endpoints that have the label `role=public`.

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "from-world-to-role-public"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: public
  ingress:
    - fromEntities:
      - world

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value":"from-world-to-role-public"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"role":"public"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromEntities": ["world"]
    }]
}]

```

## Node based[](#node-based "Permalink to this heading")

Note

Example below with `fromNodes/toNodes` fields will only take effect when
`enable-node-selector-labels` flag is set to true (or equivalent Helm value
`nodeSelectorLabels: true`).

When `--enable-node-selector-labels=true` is specified, every cilium-agent
allocates a different local [security identity](../../network/identity/#arch-id-security) for all
other nodes. But instead of using [local scoped identity](../../../internals/security-identities/#local-scoped-identity)
it uses [remote-node scoped identity](../../../internals/security-identities/#remote-node-scoped-identity) identity range.

By default all labels that `Node` object has attached are taken into account,
which might result in allocation of **unique** identity for each remote-node.
For these cases it is also possible to filter only
[security relevant labels](../../../gettingstarted/terminology/#security-relevant-labels) with `--node-labels` flag.

This example shows how to allow all endpoints with the label `env=prod` to receive
traffic **only** from control plane (labeled
`node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=""`) nodes in the cluster (or clustermesh).

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "to-prod-from-control-plane-nodes"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
  ingress:
    - fromNodes:
        - matchLabels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""

```

```
[{
    "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "to-prod-from-control-plane-nodes"}],
    "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels": {"env":"prod"}},
    "ingress": [{
        "fromNodes": [{
            "matchLabels": {"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane": ""}
        }]
    }]
}]

```

## IP/CIDR based[](#ip-cidr-based "Permalink to this heading")

CIDR policies are used to define policies to and from endpoints which are not
managed by Cilium and thus do not have labels associated with them. These are
typically external services, VMs or metal machines running in particular
subnets. CIDR policy can also be used to limit access to external services, for
example to limit external access to a particular IP range. CIDR policies can
be applied at ingress or egress.

CIDR rules apply if Cilium cannot map the source or destination to an identity
derived from endpoint labels, ie the [Special Identities](../../../gettingstarted/terminology/#reserved-labels). For example, CIDR rules
will apply to traffic where one side of the connection is:

* A network endpoint outside the cluster
* The host network namespace where the pod is running.
* Within the cluster prefix but the IP’s networking is not provided by Cilium.
* ([optional](#cidr-select-nodes)) Node IPs within the cluster

Conversely, CIDR rules do not apply to traffic where both sides of the
connection are either managed by Cilium or use an IP belonging to a node in the
cluster (including host networking pods). This traffic may be allowed using
labels, services or entities -based policies as described above.

### Ingress[](#id5 "Permalink to this heading")

fromCIDR

List of source prefixes/CIDRs that are allowed to talk to all endpoints
selected by the `endpointSelector`.

fromCIDRSet

List of source prefixes/CIDRs that are allowed to talk to all endpoints
selected by the `endpointSelector`, along with an optional list of
prefixes/CIDRs per source prefix/CIDR that are subnets of the source
prefix/CIDR from which communication is not allowed.

### Egress[](#id6 "Permalink to this heading")

toCIDR

List of destination prefixes/CIDRs that endpoints selected by
`endpointSelector` are allowed to talk to. Note that endpoints which are
selected by a `fromEndpoints` are automatically allowed to reply back to
the respective destination endpoints.

toCIDRSet

List of destination prefixes/CIDRs that are allowed to talk to all endpoints
selected by the `endpointSelector`, along with an optional list of
prefixes/CIDRs per source prefix/CIDR that are subnets of the destination
prefix/CIDR to which communication is not allowed.

### Allow to external CIDR block[](#allow-to-external-cidr-block "Permalink to this heading")

This example shows how to allow all endpoints with the label `app=myService`
to talk to the external IP `20.1.1.1`, as well as the CIDR prefix `10.0.0.0/8`,
but not CIDR prefix `10.96.0.0/12`

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"

  - toCIDRSet:
    - cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
      except:
      - 10.96.0.0/12

}]

```

### Selecting nodes with CIDR / ipBlock[](#selecting-nodes-with-cidr-ipblock "Permalink to this heading")

Note

This is a beta feature. Please provide feedback and file a GitHub issue if
you experience any problems.

By default, CIDR-based selectors do not match in-cluster entities (pods or nodes).
Optionally, you can direct the policy engine to select nodes by CIDR / ipBlock.
This requires you to configure Cilium with `--policy-cidr-match-mode=nodes` or
the equivalent Helm value `policyCIDRMatchMode: nodes`. It is safe to toggle this
option on a running cluster, and toggling the option affects neither upgrades nor downgrades.

When `--policy-cidr-match-mode=nodes` is specified, every agent allocates a
distinct local [security identity](../../network/identity/#arch-id-security) for all other nodes.
This slightly increases memory usage – approximately 1MB for every 1000 nodes
in the cluster.

This is particularly relevant to self-hosted clusters – that is, clusters where
the apiserver is hosted on in-cluster nodes. Because CIDR-based selectors ignore
nodes by default, you must ordinarily use the `kube-apiserver` [entity](#entities-based)
as part of a CiliumNetworkPolicy. Setting `--policy-cidr-match-mode=nodes` permits
selecting the apiserver via an `ipBlock` peer in a KubernetesNetworkPolicy.

## DNS based[](#dns-based "Permalink to this heading")

DNS policies are used to define Layer 3 policies to endpoints that are not
managed by Cilium, but have DNS queryable domain names. The IP addresses
provided in DNS responses are allowed by Cilium in a similar manner to IPs in
[CIDR based](#cidr-based) policies. They are an alternative when the remote IPs may change
or are not know prior, or when DNS is more convenient. To enforce policy on
DNS requests themselves, see [Layer 7 Examples](#layer-7-examples).

Note

In order to associate domain names with IP addresses, Cilium intercepts
DNS responses per-Endpoint using a [DNS Proxy](#dns-proxy). This requires Cilium
to be configured with `--enable-l7-proxy=true` and an L7 policy allowing
DNS requests. For more details, see [Obtaining DNS Data for use by toFQDNs](#dns-obtaining-data).

An L3 [CIDR based](#cidr-based) rule is generated for every `toFQDNs`
rule and applies to the same endpoints. The IP information is selected for
insertion by `matchName` or `matchPattern` rules, and is collected from all
DNS responses seen by Cilium on the node. Multiple selectors may be included in
a single egress rule.

Note

The DNS Proxy is provided in each Cilium agent.
As a result, DNS requests targeted by policies depend on the availability
of the Cilium agent pod.
This includes DNS policies ([Layer 7 Protocol Visibility](../../../observability/visibility/#proxy-visibility)).

`toFQDNs` egress rules cannot contain any other L3 rules, such as
`toEndpoints` (under [Endpoints Based](#endpoints-based)) and `toCIDRs` (under [CIDR Based](#cidr-based)).
They may contain L4/L7 rules, such as `toPorts` (see [Layer 4 Examples](#layer-4-examples))
with, optionally, `HTTP` and `Kafka` sections (see [Layer 7 Examples](#layer-7-examples)).

Note

DNS based rules are intended for external connections and behave
similarly to [CIDR based](#cidr-based) rules. See [Services based](#services-based) and
[Endpoints based](#endpoints-based) for cluster-internal traffic.

IPs to be allowed are selected via:

`toFQDNs.matchName`

Inserts IPs of domains that match `matchName` exactly. Multiple distinct
names may be included in separate `matchName` entries and IPs for domains
that match any `matchName` will be inserted.

`toFQDNs.matchPattern`

Inserts IPs of domains that match the pattern in `matchPattern`, accounting
for wildcards. Patterns are composed of literal characters that are allowed
in domain names: a-z, 0-9, `.` and `-`.

`*` is allowed as a wildcard with a number of convenience behaviors:

* `*` within a domain allows 0 or more valid DNS characters, except for the
  `.` separator. `*.cilium.io` will match `sub.cilium.io` but not
  `cilium.io` or `sub.sub.cilium.io`. `part*ial.com` will match `partial.com` and
  `part-extra-ial.com`.
* `*` alone matches all names, and inserts all cached DNS IPs into this
  rule.

The example below allows all DNS traffic on port 53 to the DNS service and
intercepts it via the [DNS Proxy](#dns-proxy). If using a non-standard DNS port for
a DNS application behind a Kubernetes service, the port must match the backend
port. When the application makes a request for my-remote-service.com, Cilium
learns the IP address and will allow traffic due to the match on the name under
the `toFQDNs.matchName` rule.

### Managing Short-Lived Connections & Maximum IPs per FQDN/endpoint[](#managing-short-lived-connections-maximum-ips-per-fqdn-endpoint "Permalink to this heading")

Many short-lived connections can grow the number of IPs mapping to an FQDN
quickly. In order to limit the number of IP addresses that map a particular
FQDN, each FQDN has a per-endpoint max capacity of IPs that will be retained
(default: 50). Once this limit is exceeded, the oldest IP entries are
automatically expired from the cache. This capacity can be changed using the
`--tofqdns-endpoint-max-ip-per-hostname` option.

As with long-lived connections above, live connections are not expired until
they terminate. It is safe to mix long- and short-lived connections from the
same Pod. IPs above the limit described above will only be removed if unused by
a connection.

# Layer 4 Examples[](#layer-4-examples "Permalink to this heading")

## Limit ingress/egress ports[](#limit-ingress-egress-ports "Permalink to this heading")

Layer 4 policy can be specified in addition to layer 3 policies or independently.
It restricts the ability of an endpoint to emit and/or receive packets on a
particular port using a particular protocol. If no layer 4 policy is specified
for an endpoint, the endpoint is allowed to send and receive on all layer 4
ports and protocols including ICMP. If any layer 4 policy is specified, then
ICMP will be blocked unless it’s related to a connection that is otherwise
allowed by the policy. Layer 4 policies apply to ports after service port
mapping has been applied.

Layer 4 policy can be specified at both ingress and egress using the
`toPorts` field. The `toPorts` field takes a `PortProtocol` structure
which is defined as follows:

```
// PortProtocol specifies an L4 port with an optional transport protocol
type PortProtocol struct {
        // Port can be an L4 port number, or a name in the form of "http"
        // or "http-8080". EndPort is ignored if Port is a named port.
        Port string `json:"port"`

        // EndPort can only be an L4 port number. It is ignored when
        // Port is a named port.
        //
        // +optional
        EndPort int32 `json:"endPort,omitempty"`

        // Protocol is the L4 protocol. If omitted or empty, any protocol
        // matches. Accepted values: "TCP", "UDP", ""/"ANY"
        //
        // Matching on ICMP is not supported.
        //
        // +optional
        Protocol string `json:"protocol,omitempty"`
}

```

### Example (L4)[](#example-l4 "Permalink to this heading")

The following rule limits all endpoints with the label `app=myService` to
only be able to emit packets using TCP on port 80, to any layer 3 destination:

        ]
    }]
}]

```

### Example Port Ranges[](#example-port-ranges "Permalink to this heading")

```

### Labels-dependent Layer 4 rule[](#labels-dependent-layer-4-rule "Permalink to this heading")

This example enables all endpoints with the label `role=frontend` to
communicate with all endpoints with the label `role=backend`, but they must
communicate using TCP on port 80. Endpoints with other labels will not be
able to communicate with the endpoints with the label `role=backend`, and
endpoints with the label `role=frontend` will not be able to communicate with
`role=backend` on ports other than 80.

### CIDR-dependent Layer 4 Rule[](#cidr-dependent-layer-4-rule "Permalink to this heading")

This example enables all endpoints with the label `role=crawler` to
communicate with all remote destinations inside the CIDR `192.0.2.0/24`, but
they must communicate using TCP on port 80. The policy does not allow Endpoints
without the label `role=crawler` to communicate with destinations in the CIDR
`192.0.2.0/24`. Furthermore, endpoints with the label `role=crawler` will
not be able to communicate with destinations in the CIDR `192.0.2.0/24` on
ports other than port 80.

## Limit ICMP/ICMPv6 types[](#limit-icmp-icmpv6-types "Permalink to this heading")

ICMP policy can be specified in addition to layer 3 policies or independently.
It restricts the ability of an endpoint to emit and/or receive packets on a
particular ICMP/ICMPv6 type (both type (integer) and corresponding CamelCase message (string) are supported).
If any ICMP policy is specified, layer 4 and ICMP communication will be blocked
unless it’s related to a connection that is otherwise allowed by the policy.

ICMP policy can be specified at both ingress and egress using the
`icmps` field. The `icmps` field takes a `ICMPField` structure
which is defined as follows:

```

### Example (ICMP/ICMPv6)[](#example-icmp-icmpv6 "Permalink to this heading")

The following rule limits all endpoints with the label `app=myService` to
only be able to emit packets using ICMP with type 8 and ICMPv6 with message EchoRequest,
to any layer 3 destination:

k8s YAMLJSON
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "icmp-rule"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myService
  egress:
  - icmps:
    - fields:
      - type: 8
        family: IPv4
      - type: EchoRequest
        family: IPv6

```

```
[{
  "labels": [{"key": "name", "value": "icmp-rule"}],
  "endpointSelector": {"matchLabels":{"app":"myService"}},
  "egress": [{
    "icmps": [
      {"fields":[ {"type": 8, "family": "IPv4"}]},
      {"fields":[ {"type": "EchoRequest", "family": "IPv6"}]}
    ]
  }]
}]

```

# Layer 7 Examples[](#layer-7-examples "Permalink to this heading")

Layer 7 policy rules are embedded into [Layer 4 Examples](#l4-policy) rules and can be specified
for ingress and egress. `L7Rules` structure is a base type containing an
enumeration of protocol specific fields.

```
// L7Rules is a union of port level rule types. Mixing of different port
// level rule types is disallowed, so exactly one of the following must be set.
// If none are specified, then no additional port level rules are applied.
type L7Rules struct {
        // HTTP specific rules.
        //
        // +optional
        HTTP []PortRuleHTTP `json:"http,omitempty"`

        // Kafka-specific rules.
        //
        // +optional
        Kafka []PortRuleKafka `json:"kafka,omitempty"`

        // DNS-specific rules.
        //
        // +optional
        DNS []PortRuleDNS `json:"dns,omitempty"`
}

```

The structure is implemented as a union, i.e. only one member field can be used
per port. If multiple `toPorts` rules with identical `PortProtocol` select
an overlapping list of endpoints, then the layer 7 rules are combined together
if they are of the same type. If the type differs, the policy is rejected.

Each member consists of a list of application protocol rules. A layer 7
request is permitted if at least one of the rules matches. If no rules are
specified, then all traffic is permitted.

If a layer 4 rule is specified in the policy, and a similar layer 4 rule
with layer 7 rules is also specified, then the layer 7 portions of the
latter rule will have no effect.

Note

Unlike layer 3 and layer 4 policies, violation of layer 7 rules does
not result in packet drops. Instead, if possible, an application
protocol specific access denied message is crafted and returned, e.g.
an *HTTP 403 access denied* is sent back for HTTP requests which
violate the policy, or a *DNS REFUSED* response for DNS requests.

Note

Layer 7 rules do not currently support port ranges.

Note

There is currently a max limit of 40 ports with layer 7 policies per
endpoint. This might change in the future when support for ranges is
added.

Note

Layer 7 rules are not currently supported in [Host Policies](#hostpolicies), i.e.,
policies that use [Node Selector](../intro/#nodeselector).

Note

Layer 7 policies will proxy traffic through a node-local [Envoy](../../network/proxy/envoy/#envoy)
instance, which will either be deployed as a DaemonSet or embedded in the agent pod.
When Envoy is embedded in the agent pod, Layer 7 traffic targeted by policies
will therefore depend on the availability of the Cilium agent pod.

## HTTP[](#http "Permalink to this heading")

The following fields can be matched on:

Path

Path is an extended POSIX regex matched against the path of a request.
Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional “path”
part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a `/`. If
omitted or empty, all paths are all allowed.

Method

Method is an extended POSIX regex matched against the method of a request,
e.g. `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, … If omitted or
empty, all methods are allowed.

Host

Host is an extended POSIX regex matched against the host header of a request,
e.g. `foo.com`. If omitted or empty, the value of the host header is
ignored.

Headers

Headers is a list of HTTP headers which must be present in the request. If
omitted or empty, requests are allowed regardless of headers present.

### Allow GET /public[](#allow-get-public "Permalink to this heading")

The following example allows `GET` requests to the URL `/public` from the
endpoints with the labels `env=prod` to endpoints with the labels
`app=service`, but requests to any other URL, or using another method, will
be rejected. Requests on ports other than port 80 will be dropped.

### All GET /path1 and PUT /path2 when header set[](#all-get-path1-and-put-path2-when-header-set "Permalink to this heading")

The following example limits all endpoints which carry the labels
`app=myService` to only be able to receive packets on port 80 using TCP.
While communicating on this port, the only API endpoints allowed will be `GET
/path1`, and `PUT /path2` with the HTTP header `X-My-Header` set to
`true`:

## Kafka (beta)[](#kafka-beta "Permalink to this heading")

Note

This is a beta feature. Please provide feedback and file a GitHub issue if
you experience any problems.

PortRuleKafka is a list of Kafka protocol constraints. All fields are optional,
if all fields are empty or missing, the rule will match all Kafka messages.
There are two ways to specify the Kafka rules. We can choose to specify a
high-level “produce” or “consume” role to a topic or choose to specify more
low-level Kafka protocol specific apiKeys. Writing rules based on Kafka roles
is easier and covers most common use cases, however if more granularity is
needed then users can alternatively write rules using specific apiKeys.

The following fields can be matched on:

Role

Role is a case-insensitive string which describes a group of API keys
necessary to perform certain higher-level Kafka operations such as “produce”
or “consume”. A Role automatically expands into all APIKeys required
to perform the specified higher-level operation.
The following roles are supported:

> * “produce”: Allow producing to the topics specified in the rule.
> * “consume”: Allow consuming from the topics specified in the rule.

This field is incompatible with the APIKey field, i.e APIKey and Role
cannot both be specified in the same rule.
If omitted or empty, and if APIKey is not specified, then all keys are
allowed.

APIKey

APIKey is a case-insensitive string matched against the key of a request,
for example “produce”, “fetch”, “createtopic”, “deletetopic”. For a more
extensive list, see the [Kafka protocol reference](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#protocol_api_keys).
This field is incompatible with the Role field.

APIVersion

APIVersion is the version matched against the api version of the Kafka
message. If set, it must be a string representing a positive integer. If
omitted or empty, all versions are allowed.

ClientID

ClientID is the client identifier as provided in the request.

From Kafka protocol documentation: This is a user supplied identifier for the
client application. The user can use any identifier they like and it will be
used when logging errors, monitoring aggregates, etc. For example, one might
want to monitor not just the requests per second overall, but the number
coming from each client application (each of which could reside on multiple
servers). This id acts as a logical grouping across all requests from a
particular client.

If omitted or empty, all client identifiers are allowed.

Topic

Topic is the topic name contained in the message. If a Kafka request contains
multiple topics, then all topics in the message must be allowed by the policy
or the message will be rejected.

This constraint is ignored if the matched request message type does not
contain any topic. The maximum length of the Topic is 249 characters,
which must be either `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.` or `_`.

If omitted or empty, all topics are allowed.

## DNS Policy and IP Discovery[](#dns-policy-and-ip-discovery "Permalink to this heading")

Policy may be applied to DNS traffic, allowing or disallowing specific DNS
query names or patterns of names (other DNS fields, such as query type, are not
considered). This policy is effected via a DNS proxy, which is also used to
collect IPs used to populate L3 [DNS based](#dns-based) `toFQDNs` rules.

Note

While Layer 7 DNS policy can be applied without any other Layer 3
rules, the presence of a Layer 7 rule (with its Layer 3 and 4
components) will block other traffic.

DNS policy may be applied via:

`matchName`

Allows queries for domains that match `matchName` exactly. Multiple
distinct names may be included in separate `matchName` entries and queries
for domains that match any `matchName` will be allowed.

`matchPattern`

Allows queries for domains that match the pattern in `matchPattern`,
accounting for wildcards. Patterns are composed of literal characters that
that are allowed in domain names: a-z, 0-9, `.` and `-`.

`*` is allowed as a wildcard with a number of convenience behaviors:

* `*` within a domain allows 0 or more valid DNS characters, except for the
  `.` separator. `*.cilium.io` will match `sub.cilium.io` but not
  `cilium.io`. `part*ial.com` will match `partial.com` and
  `part-extra-ial.com`.
* `*` alone matches all names, and inserts all IPs in DNS responses into
  the cilium-agent DNS cache.

In this example, L7 DNS policy allows queries for `cilium.io`, any subdomains
of `cilium.io`, and any subdomains of `api.cilium.io`. No other DNS queries
will be allowed.

The separate L3 `toFQDNs` egress rule allows connections to any IPs returned
in DNS queries for `cilium.io`, `sub.cilium.io`, `service1.api.cilium.io`
and any matches of `special*service.api.cilium.io`, such as
`special-region1-service.api.cilium.io` but not
`region1-service.api.cilium.io`. DNS queries to `anothersub.cilium.io` are
allowed but connections to the returned IPs are not, as there is no L3
`toFQDNs` rule selecting them. L4 and L7 policy may also be applied (see
[DNS based](#dns-based)), restricting connections to TCP port 80 in this case.

          { "matchPattern": "special*service.api.cilium.io" }
       ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

Note

When applying DNS policy in kubernetes, queries for
service.namespace.svc.cluster.local. must be explicitly allowed
with `matchPattern: *.*.svc.cluster.local.`.

Similarly, queries that rely on the DNS search list to complete the
FQDN must be allowed in their entirety. e.g. A query for
`servicename` that succeeds with
`servicename.namespace.svc.cluster.local.` must have the latter
allowed with `matchName` or `matchPattern`. See [Alpine/musl deployments and DNS Refused](#alpine-musl-deployments-and-dns-refused).

### Obtaining DNS Data for use by `toFQDNs`[](#obtaining-dns-data-for-use-by-tofqdns "Permalink to this heading")

IPs are obtained via intercepting DNS requests with a proxy or DNS polling, and
matching names are inserted irrespective of how the data is obtained. These IPs
can be selected with `toFQDN` rules. DNS responses are cached within Cilium
agent respecting TTL.

#### DNS Proxy[](#dns-proxy "Permalink to this heading")

> A DNS Proxy intercepts egress DNS traffic and records IPs seen in the
> responses. This interception is, itself, a separate policy rule governing the
> DNS requests, and must be specified separately. For details on how to enforce
> policy on DNS requests and configuring the DNS proxy, see [Layer 7
> Examples](#layer-7-examples).
>
> Only IPs in intercepted DNS responses to an application will be allowed in
> the Cilium policy rules. For a given domain name, IPs from responses to all
> pods managed by a Cilium instance are allowed by policy (respecting TTLs).
> This ensures that allowed IPs are consistent with those returned to
> applications. The DNS Proxy is the only method to allow IPs from responses
> allowed by wildcard L7 DNS `matchPattern` rules for use in `toFQDNs`
> rules.
>
> The following example obtains DNS data by interception without blocking any
> DNS requests. It allows L3 connections to `cilium.io`, `sub.cilium.io`
> and any subdomains of `sub.cilium.io`.

### Alpine/musl deployments and DNS Refused[](#alpine-musl-deployments-and-dns-refused "Permalink to this heading")

Some common container images treat the DNS `Refused` response when the [DNS
Proxy](#dns-proxy) rejects a query as a more general failure. This stops traversal of the
search list defined in `/etc/resolv.conf`. It is common for pods to search by
appending `.svc.cluster.local.` to DNS queries. When this occurs, a lookup
for `cilium.io` may first be attempted as
`cilium.io.namespace.svc.cluster.local.` and rejected by the proxy. Instead
of continuing and eventually attempting `cilium.io.` alone, the Pod treats
the DNS lookup is treated as failed.

This can be mitigated with the `--tofqdns-dns-reject-response-code` option.
The default is `refused` but `nameError` can be selected, causing the proxy
to return a NXDomain response to refused queries.

A more pod-specific solution is to configure `ndots` appropriately for each
Pod, via `dnsConfig`, so that the search list is not used for DNS lookups
that do not need it. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-config)
for instructions.

# Deny Policies[](#deny-policies "Permalink to this heading")

Deny policies, available and enabled by default since Cilium 1.9, allows to
explicitly restrict certain traffic to and from a Pod.

Deny policies take precedence over allow policies, regardless of whether they
are a Cilium Network Policy, a Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy or even a
Kubernetes Network Policy.

Similarly to “allow” policies, Pods will enter default-deny mode as soon a
single policy selects it.

If multiple allow and deny policies are applied to the same pod, the following
table represents the expected enforcement for that Pod:

| **Set of Ingress Policies Deployed to Server Pod** | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Allow Policies** | Layer 7 (HTTP) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Layer 4 (80/TCP) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Layer 4 (81/TCP) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| Layer 3 (Pod: Client) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| **Deny Policies** | Layer 4 (80/TCP) |  | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Layer 3 (Pod: Client) |  |  | ✓ | ✓ |  |
| **Result for Traffic Connections (Allowed / Denied)** | | | | | | |
| **Client → Server** | curl server:81 | Allowed | Allowed | Denied | Denied | Denied |
| curl server:80 | Allowed | Denied | Denied | Denied | Denied |
| ping server | Allowed | Allowed | Denied | Denied | Denied |

If we pick the second column in the above table, the bottom section shows the
forwarding behaviour for a policy that selects curl or ping traffic between the
client and server:

* Curl to port 81 is allowed because there is an allow policy on port 81, and
  no deny policy on that port;
* Curl to port 80 is denied because there is a deny policy on that port;
* Ping to the server is allowed because there is a Layer 3 allow policy and no deny.

The following policy will deny ingress from “world” on all namespaces on all
Pods managed by Cilium. Existing inter-cluster policies will still be allowed
as this policy is allowing traffic from everywhere except from “world”.

k8s YAML
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "external-lockdown"
spec:
  endpointSelector: {}
  ingressDeny:
  - fromEntities:
    - "world"
  ingress:
  - fromEntities:
    - "all"

```

Deny policies do not support: policy enforcement at L7, i.e., specifically
denying an URL and `toFQDNs`, i.e., specifically denying traffic to a specific
domain name.

# Disk based Cilium Network Policies[](#disk-based-cilium-network-policies "Permalink to this heading")

This functionality enables users to place network policy YAML files directly into
the node’s filesystem, bypassing the need for definition via k8s CRD.
By setting the config field `static-cnp-path`, users specify the directory from
which policies will be loaded. The Cilium agent then processes all policy YAML files
present in this directory, transforming them into rules that are incorporated into
the policy engine. Additionally, the Cilium agent monitors this directory for any
new policy YAML files as well as any updates or deletions, making corresponding
updates to the policy engine’s rules. It is important to note that this feature
only supports CiliumNetworkPolicy and CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy.

The directory that the Cilium agent needs to monitor should be mounted from the host
using volume mounts. For users deploying via Helm, this can be enabled via `extraArgs`
and `extraHostPathMounts` as follows:

```
extraArgs:
- --static-cnp-path=/policies
extraHostPathMounts:
- name: static-policies
   mountPath: /policies
   hostPath: /policies
   hostPathType: Directory

```

To determine whether a policy was established via Kubernetes CRD or directly from a directory,
execute the command `cilium policy get` and examine the source attribute within the policy.
In output, you could notice policies that have been sourced from a directory will have the
`source` field set as `directory`. Additionally, `cilium endpoint get <endpoint_id>` also have
fields to show the source of policy associated with that endpoint.

## Previous limitations and known issues[](#previous-limitations-and-known-issues "Permalink to this heading")

For Cilium versions prior to 1.14 deny-policies for peers outside the cluster
sometimes did not work because of [GitHub issue 15198](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/15198). Make sure that you are
using version 1.14 or later if you are relying on deny policies to manage
external traffic to your cluster.

# Host Policies[](#host-policies "Permalink to this heading")

Host policies take the form of a [CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy](../../../network/kubernetes/policy/#ciliumclusterwidenetworkpolicy) with a
[Node Selector](../intro/#nodeselector) instead of an [Endpoint Selector](../intro/#endpointselector). Host policies can
have layer 3 and layer 4 rules on both ingress and egress. They cannot have
layer 7 rules.

Host policies apply to all the nodes selected by their [Node Selector](../intro/#nodeselector). In
each selected node, they apply only to the host namespace, including
host-networking pods. They don’t apply to communications between
non-host-networking pods and locations outside of the cluster.

Installation of Host Policies requires the addition of the following `helm`
flags when installing Cilium:

* `--set devices='{interface}'` where `interface` refers to the network
  device Cilium is configured on, for example `eth0`. If you omit this
  option, Cilium auto-detects what interface the host firewall applies to.
* `--set hostFirewall.enabled=true`

As an example, the following policy allows ingress traffic for any node with
the label `type=ingress-worker` on TCP ports 22, 6443 (kube-apiserver), 2379
(etcd), and 4240 (health checks), as well as UDP port 8472 (VXLAN).

k8s YAML
```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "lock-down-ingress-worker-node"
spec:
  description: "Allow a minimum set of required ports on ingress of worker nodes"
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      type: ingress-worker
  ingress:
  - fromEntities:
    - remote-node
    - health
  - toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "22"
        protocol: TCP
      - port: "6443"
        protocol: TCP
      - port: "2379"
        protocol: TCP
      - port: "4240"
        protocol: TCP
      - port: "8472"
        protocol: UDP

```

To reuse this policy, replace the `port:` values with ports used in your
environment.

## Troubleshooting Host Policies[](#troubleshooting-host-policies "Permalink to this heading")

If you have troubles with Host Policies, try the following steps:

* Ensure the `helm` options listed in [the Host Policies description](#hostpolicies) were applied during installation.
* To verify that your policy has been accepted and applied by the Cilium agent,
  run `kubectl get CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy -o yaml` and make sure the
  policy is listed.
* If policies don’t seem to be applied to your nodes, verify the
  `nodeSelector` is labeled correctly in your environment. In the example
  configuration, you can run `kubectl get nodes -o
  custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,LABELS:.metadata.labels | grep
  type:ingress-worker` to verify labels match the policy.

To troubleshoot policies for a given node, try the following steps. For all
steps, run `cilium-dbg` in the relevant namespace, on the Cilium agent pod
for the node, for example with:

```
$ kubectl exec -n $CILIUM_NAMESPACE $CILIUM_POD_NAME -- cilium-dbg ...

```

Retrieve the endpoint ID for the host endpoint on the node with `cilium-dbg
endpoint get -l reserved:host -o jsonpath='{[0].id}'`. Use this ID to replace
`$HOST_EP_ID` in the next steps:

* If policies are applied, but not enforced for the node, check the status of
  the policy audit mode with `cilium-dbg endpoint config $HOST_EP_ID | grep
  PolicyAuditMode`. If necessary, [disable the audit mode](../../host-firewall/#disable-policy-audit-mode).
* Run `cilium-dbg endpoint list`, and look for the host endpoint, with
  `$HOST_EP_ID` and the `reserved:host` label. Ensure that policy is
  enabled in the selected direction.
* Run `cilium-dbg status list` and check the devices listed in the `Host
  firewall` field. Verify that traffic actually reaches the listed devices.
* Use `cilium-dbg monitor` with `--related-to $HOST_EP_ID` to examine
  traffic for the host endpoint.

## Host Policies known issues[](#host-policies-known-issues "Permalink to this heading")

* The first time Cilium enforces Host Policies in the cluster, it may drop
  reply traffic for legitimate connections that should be allowed by the
  policies in place. Connections should stabilize again after a few seconds.
  One workaround is to enable, disable, then re-enable Host Policies
  enforcement. For details, see [GitHub issue 25448](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/25448).
* In the context of ClusterMesh, the following combination of options is not
  supported:

  + Cilium operating in CRD mode (as opposed to KVstore mode),
  + Host Policies enabled,
  + tunneling enabled,
  + kube-proxy-replacement enabled, and
  + WireGuard enabled.

  This combination results in a failure to connect to the
  clustermesh-apiserver. For details, refer to [GitHub issue 31209](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/31209).
* Host Policies do not work on host WireGuard interfaces. For details, see
  [GitHub issue 17636](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/17636).
* When Host Policies are enabled, hosts drop traffic from layer-2 protocols
  that they consider as unknown, even if no Host Policies are loaded. For
  example, this affects LLC traffic (see [GitHub issue 17877](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/17877)) or VRRP traffic
  (see [GitHub issue 18347](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/18347)).
* When kube-proxy-replacement is disabled, or configured not to implement
  services for the native device (such as NodePort), hosts will enforce Host
  Policies on service addresses rather than the service endpoints. For details,
  refer to [GitHub issue 12545](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/12545).

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
