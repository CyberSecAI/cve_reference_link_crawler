Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Root Cause:** The `/core/tools/update_place.php` endpoint in Flusity-CMS v2.33 does not implement proper CSRF protection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Lack of CSRF token or other mechanisms to verify the request's origin.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions, such as modifying place names in the CMS.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack is carried out by creating a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing their malicious page. No specific position is needed as this attack exploits the trust between a logged-in user and the vulnerable site.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML code shows how to exploit the CSRF vulnerability. It includes:
*   A form that targets the vulnerable `update_place.php` endpoint.
*   Hidden input fields containing the necessary parameters to perform a place update.  Specifically, `action`, `place_id`, and `place_name`.
*   A submit button that, when clicked by a logged-in victim, will trigger the malicious request.

The images provided as part of the PoC show the process and successful exploitation of the vulnerability.
