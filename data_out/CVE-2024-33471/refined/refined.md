- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the device passing SMTP credentials in plaintext when authenticating to a mail server after the mail server host is changed by an administrative user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Plaintext storage of SMTP credentials.
    - Lack of input validation/sanitization on the mail server host field.
    - Absence of re-authentication/re-entry of SMTP credentials upon changes to the mail server host (in affected S models prior to firmware 1.10.4).
    - Credential pass-back.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative access can intercept the SMTP credentials in plaintext, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the email account associated with those credentials. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker gains administrative access to the Room Alert device.
    - The attacker modifies the mail server host setting within the device's configuration to point to an attacker controlled server.
    - When the device tries to authenticate to the attacker-controlled mail server it sends the previously stored SMTP credentials in plain text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs administrative access to the Room Alert device's web interface or configuration settings.
    - The attacker needs to control or have access to an SMTP server they control and able to capture the credentials being passed to it from the affected device.
