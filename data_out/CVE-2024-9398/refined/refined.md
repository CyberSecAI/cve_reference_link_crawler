  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `window.open` function, which when called with specific protocol handlers, returns a result that can be used to determine if the application which implements that protocol handler is installed.",

    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can enumerate installed applications by checking the result of calls to `window.open` with specifically set protocol handlers.",

      "By calling `window.open` with specific protocol handlers and observing the result."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application (Thunderbird, Firefox). No special privileges are needed. This is achievable through a crafted web page.",
