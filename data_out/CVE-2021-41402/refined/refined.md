Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the "Permalink" parameter when creating or editing pages in the FlatCore-CMS administrative panel. Malicious PHP code inserted into this parameter is not properly escaped or filtered, allowing it to be stored and subsequently executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a code injection flaw. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Permalink" field, allowing the injection of arbitrary PHP code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the "Permalink" field's input. This allows an attacker to inject server-side scripting code (PHP).
- **File Modification:** The injected malicious code is stored in cache files (`/content/cache/active_urls.php` and `/content/cache/cache_lastedit.php`), which means the injected code is stored persistently and executed by the webserver when those cached files are used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server user.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE could lead to full system compromise if the attacker is able to escalate privileges.
- **Website Defacement/Malware Distribution:** An attacker could deface the website, inject malicious scripts for browser-based attacks, or use the server as a staging area for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the FlatCore-CMS administrative panel, specifically via the page creation/editing interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the FlatCore-CMS backend to create or edit pages. This implies a compromised administrator account or the exploitation of another vulnerability that allows bypassing authentication.
- **Knowledge of the CMS:** An understanding of how the FlatCore CMS stores permalink information into the cache files.
