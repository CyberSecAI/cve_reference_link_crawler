Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper session management and authentication controls in the "Online Graduate Tracer System for College of ICT Alumni." Specifically, the system does not adequately validate user sessions or enforce authentication on subsequent page requests after an initial login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Validation:** The system allows access to authenticated pages even after cookies are deleted and the browser is refreshed, indicating that the session is not being properly tracked or validated. This means the server relies solely on the existence of cookies to determine if a user is logged in, without any server-side session validation.
- **Missing Authentication Enforcement:** After the initial login, the system does not re-authenticate the user for subsequent page accesses which allows anyone to access protected pages after a login without re-authenticating, effectively bypassing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrator functions of the system without needing valid credentials.
- **Data Manipulation:** Once authenticated, an attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive alumni data, student information, or system settings, depending on the level of access.
- **System Compromise:** This unauthorized access could potentially lead to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly navigate to admin pages after a valid login without needing any user session manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would require to login using a valid account at least once.
- The attacker can access the admin page directly after the login even if the session has expired (cookies deleted, browser refreshed)
