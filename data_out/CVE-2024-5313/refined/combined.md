CWE-668: Exposure of the Resource Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that exposes a SSH
interface over the product network interface. This does not allow to directly exploit the product or
make any unintended operation as the SSH interface access is protected by an authentication
mechanism. Impacts are limited to port scanning and fingerprinting activities as well as attempts
to perform a potential denial of service attack on the exposed SSH interface.

CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following cybersecurity best practices.

•  Device should only be used in a personal home network.
•  Device should not have a publicly accessible IP address.
•  Do NOT use port forwarding to access a device from the public internet.
•  A device should be on its own network segment. If your router supports a guest network

or VLAN, it is preferable to locate the device there.

•  Use the strongest Wi-Fi encryption available in the home Wi-Fi network, such as WPA3

or WPA2/3 with protected management frames.

•  Schedule regular reboots of your routing device, smartphones, and computers.
•  Ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain physical access to your devices or
regularly inspect the device for visual clues that may reveal a tampering attempt.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
