- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The presence of a non-disabled SSH interface on the EVlink Home Smart charging station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of an SSH interface over the product network interface (CWE-668: Exposure of the Resource Wrong Sphere).
- **Impact of exploitation:** While the SSH interface is protected by authentication, the exposure can lead to:
    - Increased exposure to potential network scanning or reconnaissance activities.
    - Port scanning and fingerprinting activities.
    - Attempts to perform a potential denial of service attack on the exposed SSH interface.
    -  It does not allow to directly exploit the product or make any unintended operation due to the authentication mechanism.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the exposed SSH interface, specifically targeting the local area network of the homeowner.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same local area network as the EVlink Home Smart charging station to access the exposed SSH interface.
