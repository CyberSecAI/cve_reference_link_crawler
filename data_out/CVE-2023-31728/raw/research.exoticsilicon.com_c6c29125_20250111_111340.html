All of our on-line services have now been moved to new servers, in a different datacenter. The back-end website code has been mostly re-written from scratch, for even better performance, and it's now running on a different operating system. We've even re-organised our office space and upgraded the air-conditioning, so we're nice and comfortable with high expectations for the future.</div><div class="j">More things have changed than have stayed the same, but rest assured that if you enjoyed Exotic Silicon before, we're confident that you'll be even happier now!</div><div class="j">Most of the old website content has either been updated or removed completely, but we've already got plenty of new material on-line that we created during the break, and there is more in the works, so stay tuned and check back regularly for updates.</div><div class="y">“Rebooted - and better for it!”</div></div><div class="b"></div><footer style="text-align:right;"><div class="_"><div class="a"><a href="/themes?r=/news">Current theme</a>: Tropical days, (auto-selected).</div><div class="a">Website copyright 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, Exotic&nbsp;Silicon.
