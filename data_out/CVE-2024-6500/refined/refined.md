{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing capability check on the 'parse_request' function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authorization, leading to arbitrary file read and delete.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files on both Windows and Linux servers. On Windows servers, attackers can also delete arbitrary files. On Linux servers, file deletion is limited to files within the WordPress installation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks by sending crafted requests to the 'parse_request' function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication required."
