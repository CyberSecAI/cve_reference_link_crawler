- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in Oracle MySQL Server versions through 8.0.35 and 8.2.0, which are incorporated into multiple NetApp products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a high privileged attacker to compromise the MySQL server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a complete denial of service (DOS) due to the ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash of MySQL Server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker requires network access via multiple protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user with network access to the vulnerable MySQL server instance.
