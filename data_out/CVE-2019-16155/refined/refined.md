The content is related to CVE-2019-16155.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how FortiClient for Linux handles specially crafted client requests injected into the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) socket. This allows for privilege escalation via backup file manipulation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of IPC socket requests leading to a privilege escalation.
- Vulnerability in the GUI component of the FortiClient that allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privilege user can run root system commands.
- System files can be overwritten.
- FortiClient processes can be crashed, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Injection of malicious client requests via the IPC socket.
- Exploitation through the GUI component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges on the Linux system where FortiClient is installed.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted requests to the IPC socket of the FortiClient process or interact with the vulnerable GUI component.
