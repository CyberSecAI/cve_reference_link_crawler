- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter (`tagname`) before outputting it back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities, especially if the user has high privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `dscf7_refreshcaptcha` and a crafted `tagname` parameter containing the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site. User interaction is required as the malicious script will execute in the context of a user's browser after the user visits a page where this reflected xss is triggered, such as a page that makes use of this plugin.
