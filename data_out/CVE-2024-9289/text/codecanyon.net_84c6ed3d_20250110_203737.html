### Affiliate Marketing Meets Multi-Level Marketing (MLM):

Affiliate marketing is a powerful strategy that lets individuals promote products and earn a commission for each sale made through their unique affiliate link. But what if you could amplify this concept? Enter Multi-Level Marketing (MLM), a strategy that rewards you not only for your direct referrals but also for the referrals made by your recruits – creating a network effect that boosts your earnings exponentially.

### Expanding with Multi-Level Marketing:

Now, imagine taking affiliate marketing a step further with Multi-Level Marketing. MLM introduces a multi-tiered structure where affiliates not only from their direct sales but also from the sales generated by their recruited affiliates, creating a network effect that can lead to substantial revenue growth. By integrating MLM into your WordPress Affiliate Program, you’re not just building a team of marketers; you’re cultivating a self-sustaining sales ecosystem.

In our Affiliate for Woocommerce Program plugin you can choose any of the MLM Matrix from **Binary, Forced Matrix, and Unilevel** and start earning money through your MLM members. You can set a number of children and levels of the MLM chain. You can even set a commission for each level.

### Binary MLM

* In Binary MLM you can set the Depth to determine how many levels can MLM chain has and can also set the maximum no of children, the maximum no of children can be 2 in the Binary MLM plan. Users start getting commission once they complete the chainset on that MLM plan by Admin.

### Forced Matrix MLM

* In the Forced matrix MLM, you can set the Depth of how many levels can MLM chain has and can also set the maximum number of children that each user can have. Users start getting commission once they complete the chainset on that MLM plan by Admin.

### Unilevel MLM

* In the UniLevel matrix, you can set the Depth of how many levels an MLM chain has. There can be an ‘N‘ number of children a user can have, but an Affiliate can have only one child under their affiliate chain.

### Unlimited MLM

* In Unlimited MLM, a user can have an unlimited number of users under their affiliate chain and the affiliate gets a commission when at least 1 member comes under his chain. Create as many affiliates as you want to promote your products.
