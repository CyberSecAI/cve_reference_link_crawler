- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary commands as root, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious request can be sent over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required. Low attack complexity.
