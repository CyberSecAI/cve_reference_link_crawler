Package        : org-mode
Version        : 9.1.14+dfsg-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-30203 CVE-2024-30204 CVE-2024-30205
Debian Bug     : 1067663

Multiple problems were discovered in Org-mode, a GNU Emacs major mode
for keeping notes, authoring documents, and maintaining to-do lists.

CVE-2024-30203 & CVE-2024-30204

    In Emacs before 29.3, LaTeX preview is enabled by default for e-mail
    attachments in some Emacs MUAs.  This can lead to denial of service.

    (A request has been submitted to MITRE to merge these CVE numbers.)

CVE-2024-30205

    In Emacs before 29.3, Org mode considers the contents of remote
    files to be trusted.  This affects Org Mode before 9.6.23.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
9.1.14+dfsg-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your org-mode packages.

For the detailed security status of org-mode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
