Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a hidden functionality within the Netgear Orbi Satellite RBS750 that allows an attacker to enable and log into a hidden telnet service through the ubus backend communications. This is achieved by sending specific commands through a crafted JSON object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Command Execution:** The core issue is the ability to execute arbitrary commands due to the hidden telnet service being enabled through the ubus interface.
-   **Hidden Functionality:** The presence of a hidden telnet service that can be enabled via a specific command is a security weakness.
-   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The vulnerability is exacerbated if the device's default administrator password has not been changed, as the SHA256 hash of the password is used for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.
-   **Full System Control:** Gaining access to the telnet service provides the attacker with a shell, granting them full control over the device.
-   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised satellite devices can potentially be used as a pivot point to further compromise other devices on the network.
-   **Data Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** An attacker could potentially exfiltrate data, modify device configurations, or disrupt device functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network-based:** The attacker needs network access to the device, either through Wi-Fi or an Ethernet connection.
-   **ubus Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the ubus interface, specifically by sending commands via HTTP POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
-   **Web GUI Password:** The attacker must know the web GUI administrator password (or exploit a device using the default password), which is used to generate the required SHA256 hash for authentication.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
-   The report provides the specific HTTP POST requests with the JSON payloads to authenticate with the device using the SHA256 hash of the administrator password and to then enable the hidden telnet service.
-   The report includes a proof-of-concept of a telnet login into the device and executing arbitrary commands.
-   The vulnerability is linked to a specific version of the firmware on the Netgear Orbi Satellite RBS750 (4.6.8.5).
-   The Netgear advisory (PSV-2022-0188) and mitigation details, including patched firmware versions, are included.
