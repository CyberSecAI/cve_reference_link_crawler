- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from improper handling of IS-IS packets received by a vulnerable device. Specifically, a crafted IS-IS packet can trigger a condition leading to a denial-of-service. The vulnerability is identified with CWE-476, which indicates a Null Pointer Dereference issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a crafted IS-IS packet to a vulnerable device after forming an adjacency.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and have established an adjacency with it via the IS-IS protocol. They do not need to be authenticated.
