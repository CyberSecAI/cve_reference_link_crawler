- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the allocation of resources without limits or throttling. Specifically, the issue arises from saving rejected certificates after an authentication failure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is related to CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling. The software allows for unbounded allocation of resources when handling rejected certificates, leading to a gradual degradation in performance.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of the vulnerability is a gradual degradation in performance. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An unauthorized attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending requests that lead to authentication failures and the subsequent saving of rejected certificates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) and can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
