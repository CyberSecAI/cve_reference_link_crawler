- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of Omniverse Kit applications (Create, Audio2Face, Isaac Sim, View, Code, and Machinima) to automatically execute embedded Python code within Universal Scene Description (USD) files. This allows for malicious code to be executed when a user opens a crafted USD file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled execution of embedded Python code in USD files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a remote attacker crafting a malicious USD file containing embedded Python code and then persuading a local user to open the file using one of the vulnerable applications.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious USD file and then convince a user to open this file locally on their system.
