# Unsigned code template execution through workflows in projectdiscovery/nuclei

## Package

gomod

github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

> 3.0.0

## Patched versions

3.2.0

## Description

### Overview

A significant security oversight was identified in Nuclei v3, involving the execution of unsigned code templates through workflows. This vulnerability specifically affects users utilizing custom workflows, potentially allowing the execution of malicious code on the user's system. This advisory outlines the impacted users, provides details on the security patch, and suggests mitigation strategies.

### Affected Users

1. **CLI Users:** Those executing custom workflows from untrusted sources. This includes workflows authored by third parties or obtained from unverified repositories.
2. **SDK Users:** Developers integrating Nuclei into their platforms, particularly if they permit the execution of custom workflows by end-users.

### Security Patch

The vulnerability is addressed in Nuclei v3.2.0. Users are strongly recommended to update to this version to mitigate the security risk.

### Mitigation

* **Immediate Upgrade:** The primary recommendation is to upgrade to Nuclei v3.2.0, where the vulnerability has been patched.
* **Avoid Untrusted Workflows:** As an interim measure, users should refrain from using custom workflows if unable to upgrade immediately. Only trusted, verified workflows should be executed.

### Details

The vulnerability stems from an oversight in the workflow execution mechanism, where unsigned code templates could be executed, bypassing the security measures intended to authenticate the integrity and source of the templates. This issue is isolated to workflow executions and does not affect direct template executions.

### Workarounds

The only effective workaround, aside from upgrading, is to avoid the use of custom workflows altogether. This approach limits functionality but ensures security until the upgrade can be performed.

### Acknowledgements

We extend our sincere gratitude to [@gpc1996](https://github.com/gpc1996) for their diligence in identifying and reporting this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
