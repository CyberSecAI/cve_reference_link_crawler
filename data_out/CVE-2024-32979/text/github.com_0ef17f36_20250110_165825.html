Wonder if we could make this more generic without making it ridiculously complex or just grepping the entire codebase

Agreed that would be nice.

We could theoretically add this particular logic to the generic view testing instead of being a single dedicated test, but since the faulty logic was common to all uses of `object_list.html` and involved a single common fix, I didn't feel like that would actually add significant value versus the increased test run time.

~~I'm always a bit surprised to rediscover that there isn't an `assertNotInHTML` in Django test.~~ (Correction: there's `assertNotContains(response, text, html=True)`) It'd be kinda neat to have a set of generic tests that throw various "bad" input into query parameters and assert that that input isn't present in the rendered page, or if present is sanitized appropriately.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This set of changes doesn't address a bug so far as I know, but while I was in here, this similarly replaces some string-splitting logic for processing form data as query parameters with the use of URLSearchParams and FormData instead, getting us ever-so-slightly further away from jQuery in the process. I did some manual testing here as well as the integration-tests passing still so I'm reasonably confident in this change.

Sorry, something went wrong.
