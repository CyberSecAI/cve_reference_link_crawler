- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the LearnPress WordPress plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user (subscriber) can execute actions that are normally reserved for users with higher privileges. The specific impact is not detailed but is stated to be "highly dangerous and expected to become mass exploited."
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting a function that lacks proper access control checks, accessible to a subscriber.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A subscriber level account is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
