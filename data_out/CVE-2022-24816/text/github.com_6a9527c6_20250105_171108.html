# Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') in jai-ext

Critical

[aaime](/aaime)
published
GHSA-v92f-jx6p-73rx
Apr 13, 2022

## Package

maven

jt-jiffle
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.22

## Patched versions

1.1.22

## Description

### Impact

Programs using jt-jiffle, and allowing Jiffle script to be provided via network request, are susceptible to a Remote Code Execution as the Jiffle script is compiled into Java code via Janino, and executed. In particular, this affects the downstream GeoServer project.

### Patches

Version 1.2.22 will contain a patch that disables the ability to inject malicious code into the resulting script.

### Workarounds

Negate the ability to compile Jiffle scripts from the final application, by removing janino-x.y.z.jar from the classpath.

### References

None.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID
