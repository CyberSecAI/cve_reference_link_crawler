- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `cwpsrv` process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required. The `cwpsrv` process, listening on the loopback interface, is targeted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
