Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-31410:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**
*   The devices managed by PowerPanel use identical certificates based on a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Impact:**

*   An attacker can impersonate any client in the system and send malicious data.

**Attack Vector:**

*   Network-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attacker needs to have access to the network where the devices managed by PowerPanel are connected.
*   Attacker needs to have low privileges in the system (e.g., an already compromised device).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key used to generate certificates for devices managed by PowerPanel. This means that all devices share the same cryptographic material.
