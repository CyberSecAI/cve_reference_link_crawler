{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `ctl_save()` function within the Cool Timeline plugin. The code checks for the presence of a nonce, but if the nonce isn't present, the check is bypassed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Missing nonce validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can save field icons via a forged request if a site administrator can be tricked into clicking a crafted link. While the direct impact might be limited to changing icons, CSRF vulnerabilities can be chained with other attacks to achieve greater impact.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an administrator, sends a forged request to the vulnerable function."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or performing an action that triggers the forged request.  No specific server access is required as the attack exploits a user's browser session"
  }
