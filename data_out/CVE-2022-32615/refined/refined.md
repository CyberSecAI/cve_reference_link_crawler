- **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from an improper input validation in the ccd component. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write can occur due to the use of uninitialized data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation within the ccd component. This allows the out-of-bounds write condition to occur when processing uninitialized data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain elevated permissions on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the device to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the device, although no additional execution privileges are needed. User interaction is not required for the exploitation to occur.
