The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47479.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition between the `r871xu_dev_remove()` function and the `ndo_open()` callback in the `rtl8712` driver. Specifically, the firmware was being released before the network device was unregistered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Use-after-free vulnerability. The driver accesses the released firmware in the `->ndo_open()` callback, which occurs because the firmware is released before unregistering the network device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A use-after-free vulnerability could potentially lead to a crash, denial of service, or possibly arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a race condition during the removal of a USB interface where the `rtl8712` driver is loaded. The sequence of events triggers the use-after-free.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to trigger the removal of a USB interface using the affected `rtl8712` driver.
