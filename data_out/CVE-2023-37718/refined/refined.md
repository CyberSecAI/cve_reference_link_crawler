Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-37718 (Based on the filename of the report.md file located at https://github.com/FirmRec/IoT-Vulns/blob/main/tenda/fromSafeClientFilter/report.md and the surrounding file structure)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `page` function, specifically within the `/goform/fromSafeClientFilter` page of Tenda routers.
* The `fromRouteStatic` function reads user-provided input for the `page` parameter and uses it in a call to `sprintf` without any length checks.
* This lack of input validation allows an attacker to write beyond the boundaries of the stack-based buffer `v15` when the user-controlled parameter `page` exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow on the stack, where writing past buffer boundaries corrupts program memory and potentially control flow.
* **Lack of input validation:** The vulnerable code does not validate the length of the user-supplied input before copying it into the stack buffer, which enables the overflow condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can cause the device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With a carefully crafted payload, an attacker can overwrite return addresses on the stack, redirect program execution to their code and achieve RCE.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/fromSafeClientFilter` endpoint.
* **`page` parameter:** The vulnerable input is the `page` parameter of the GET request. By providing a string of sufficient length, the buffer overflow occurs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target Tenda router.
* **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable endpoint `/goform/fromSafeClientFilter` and its parameters.
* **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker should be capable of constructing and sending HTTP requests containing overflow payloads.

**Additional Details:**
* The report specifies that the vulnerability affects Tenda Router models F1202 and FH1202, and possibly 4G300. Specific affected firmware versions are also mentioned.
* The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a simple way to trigger the vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request with an oversized value for the `page` parameter.
