{
  "CVE-2021-29662": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation of octal strings in Perl's Data::Validate::IP module.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The module fails to properly handle IPv4 addresses with octal components, leading to false negatives when checking if an address is private.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass IP address validation, potentially leading to SSRF, RFI, and LFI vulnerabilities. Allows unauthorized access or modification of data.",
      "Attack vectors": "Submitting specially crafted IP addresses with octal representations to applications relying on the vulnerable module for IP validation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker capable of submitting IP addresses to a vulnerable application."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Perl module Data::Validate::IP incorrectly handles octal literals in IPv4 addresses.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The module's `is_private_ipv4()` function returns a false negative for private IPs represented with octal notation, like '012.0.0.1' (which is equivalent to '10.0.0.1').",
       "Impact of exploitation": "This can be exploited to bypass security checks that rely on `is_private_ipv4()` to validate IP addresses, leading to SSRF, RFI, and LFI vulnerabilities.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker provides a specially crafted IP address string containing octal values.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit IP addresses to an application that uses the vulnerable Perl module for validation."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of octal representations in IP addresses within the `Data::Validate::IP` Perl module.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `is_private_ipv4` function incorrectly returns `false` when provided an IP address containing octal literals, like `012.0.0.1`, which should be treated as the private IP `10.0.0.1`. This leads to inconsistent validation results.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms reliant on this module to validate IP addresses as public or private. This can result in indeterminate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in applications using this module.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft IP addresses containing octal numbers, which will then be incorrectly processed by the vulnerable `Data::Validate::IP` module.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to provide the crafted IP addresses as input to a vulnerable system/application."
