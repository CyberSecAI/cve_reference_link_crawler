|  |  |  |
|  |  | It's important to understand that if C<is\_ipv4($ip)> or C<is\_ipv6($ip)> return |
|  |  | false, then all other validation functions for that IP address family will |
|  |  | I<also> return false. So for example, if C<is\_ipv4($ip)> is false, so are both |
|  |  | C<is\_private\_ipv4($ip)> I<and> C<is\_public\_ipv4($ip)>. |
|  |  | It's important to understand that if C<is\_ipv4($ip)>, C<is\_ipv6($ip)>, or |
|  |  | C<is\_ip($ip)> return false, then all other validation functions for that IP |
|  |  | address family will I<also> return false. So for example, if C<is\_ipv4($ip)> |
|  |  | returns false, then C<is\_private\_ipv4($ip)> I<and> C<is\_public\_ipv4($ip)> will |
|  |  | both also return false. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This means that simply calling C<is\_private\_ipv4($ip)> by itself is not |
|  |  | sufficient if you are dealing with untrusted input. You should always check |
|  |  | C<is\_ipv4($ip)> as well. |
|  |  | C<is\_ipv4($ip)> as well. This applies as well when using IPv6 functions or |
|  |  | generic functions like C<is\_private\_ip($ip)>. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | There are security implications to this around certain oddly formed |
|  |  | addresses. Notably, an address like "010.0.0.1" is technically valid, but the |
|  |  | operating system will treat "010" as an octal number. That means that |
|  |  | "010.0.0.1" is equivalent to "8.0.0.1", I<not> "10.0.0.1". |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | However, this module's C<is\_ipv4($ip)> function will return false for |
|  |  | addresses like "010.0.0.1" which have octal components. And of course that |
|  |  | means that it also returns false for C<is\_private\_ipv4($ip)> I<and> |
|  |  | C<is\_public\_ipv4($ip)>. |
