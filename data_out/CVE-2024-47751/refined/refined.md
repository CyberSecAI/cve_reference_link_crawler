The provided content relates to CVE-2024-47751.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an incorrect check in the `kirin_pcie_parse_port()` function within the Linux kernel's PCI subsystem. Specifically, the `pcie->num_slots` variable is compared against `MAX_PCI_SLOTS` after being incremented, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write when accessing the `pcie->gpio_id_reset` array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow**: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, caused by an incorrect check before incrementing the `pcie->num_slots`. When too many PCI slots are present, the `pcie->num_slots` is incremented and used as an index in `pcie->gpio_id_reset` array without checking if the incremented value is within the `MAX_PCI_SLOTS` bounds, leading to an out-of-bounds array access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption, which could potentially cause system instability, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the PCI configuration. Specifically, if the system is configured with a number of PCI slots that is at or exceeds MAX\_PCI\_SLOTS, the out-of-bounds write will occur.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to configure the system with a number of PCI slots that will trigger the overflow. This would typically require some level of system access or control over the device tree configuration used by the kernel.
