### Description

The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy – Feed to Post, Autoblogging, News & YouTube Video Feeds Aggregator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'feedzy\_wizard\_step\_process' and 'import\_status' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor access and above, who are normally restricted to only being able to create posts rather than pages, to draft and publish posts with arbitrary content.
