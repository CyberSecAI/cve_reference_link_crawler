- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow (CWE-120) and command injection (CWE-77) vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote command execution with root-level privileges on the affected device.
    - Denial of service (DoS) due to unexpected device restarts.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device, and remote management feature enabled or attacker on the LAN.
