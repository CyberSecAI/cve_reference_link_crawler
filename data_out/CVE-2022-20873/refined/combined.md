These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with *root*-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid *Administrator* credentials on the affected device.  Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rce-overflow-ygHByAK>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers:    + RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall   + RV130 VPN Router   + RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router   + RV215W Wireless-N VPN RouterDetermine the Device Configuration The web-based management interface of these devices is available through a LAN connection, which cannot be disabled, or through the WAN connection if the remote management feature is enabled. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.  To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled on a device, open the web-based management interface and choose **Basic Settings > Remote Management**. If the **Enable** check box is checked, remote management is enabled on the device. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notices for these products:  [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers (selected models)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/small-business-rv-series-routers/eos-eol-notice-c51-742771.pdf)  Customers are encouraged to migrate to the Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.  When considering a device migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that new devices will be sufficient for their network needs; the new devices contain sufficient memory, and current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
