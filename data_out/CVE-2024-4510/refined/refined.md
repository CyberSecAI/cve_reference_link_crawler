Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `arp_add_commit.php` interface within the Ruijie RG-UAC Unified Internet Behavior Management Audit System. The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-supplied input in the `text_ip_addr` and `text_mac_addr` parameters, which allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The system is vulnerable to OS command injection through the `arp_add_commit.php` interface.  This occurs because the application directly uses user-controlled input from `text_ip_addr` and `text_mac_addr`  within system commands without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
- **Server Control:** Successful exploitation gives the attacker control over the server, potentially allowing them to compromise the entire system, exfiltrate sensitive data, install malware or further compromise the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system in order to reach the `/view/networkConfig/ArpTable/arp_add_commit.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This typically implies network access to the system running the Ruijie RG-UAC software. They also need to be aware of the vulnerable interface URL and parameters involved in the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the backend of the application management gateway.
- The provided github link points to an exploit PoC (PDF).
- The VulDB entry ID is [263114] which provides additional details with text_ip_addr/text_mac_addr os command injection.
