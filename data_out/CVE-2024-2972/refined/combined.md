## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Floating Chat Widget < 3.1.9 - Editor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to "Chaty > New Widget"
2. Create a new widget (make sure to select WhatsApp and add a WhatsApp Number) and use Burp to intercept the request
3. For the `cht\_social\_Whatsapp[bg\_color]` entry, add the payload `#000000 <script>alert(1)</script>`
4. View the site and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
