Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the incomplete filtering functionality in the "File Sanitization Library" and "File Sanitization Option" used by RevoWorks products. Specifically, the third-party component used for sanitization fails to detect and remove Microsoft Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incomplete sanitization of files downloaded from the internet into the sandboxed environment.
- Failure to detect and remove malicious Microsoft Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of malicious macros upon opening the sanitized file in the local environment.
- Potential compromise of the local environment's information security through the executed macros.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Downloading a malicious file containing Excel 4.0 macros from the internet into the RevoWorks sandboxed environment.
- Transferring the "sanitized" file to the local environment.
- User opening the file which then executes the malicious macros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to create a malicious file with Excel 4.0 macros.
- The attacker would need to convince a user of the RevoWorks product to download the malicious file from the internet.
- The attacker does not need special privileges or network access as they are leveraging the user and the flawed file sanitization process.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects RevoWorks SCVX, RevoWorks Browser, and RevoWorks Desktop when using the "File Sanitization Library" or "File Sanitization Option" in vulnerable versions.
- The vendor has released patched versions of the products that address this vulnerability
- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-27176 and JVNDB-2022-000039.
- JPCERT/CC has assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.2 and a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 to this vulnerability.
