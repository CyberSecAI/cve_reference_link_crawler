# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1642

## FreshTomato httpd update.cgi directory traversal vulnerability

##### January 26, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-38451

##### SUMMARY

A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the httpd update.cgi functionality of FreshTomato 2022.5. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary file read. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

FreshTomato 2022.5

Siretta QUARTZ-GOLD G5.0.1.5-210720-141020

AdvancedTomato commit 67273b0

##### PRODUCT URLS

FreshTomato - <https://www.freshtomato.org/>
QUARTZ-GOLD - <https://www.siretta.com/products/industrial-routers/4g-lte-router/gigabit-ethernet-small-footprint-lte-router-eu/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

6.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

##### CWE

CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (‘Path Traversal’)

##### DETAILS

FreshTomato is an open source firmware based on linux. The firmware offers several features for Broadcom-based routers.

The FreshTomato’s httpd component offers a simple template language to call an API during the loading of the HTML page. This process is performed through `asp api`. The `asp api` normally is not directly callable, but a FreshTomato’s API called `update.cgi` will allow it.

Following is one of the functions responsible for performing the `update.cgi` API:

```
static void wo_update(char *url)
{
    const aspapi_t *api;
    const char *name;
    int argc;
    char *argv[16];
    char s[32];

    if ((name = webcgi_get("exec")) != NULL) {
        for (api = aspapi; api->name; ++api) {
            if (strcmp(api->name, name) == 0) {
                for (argc = 0; argc < 16; ++argc) {
                    snprintf(s, sizeof(s), "arg%d", argc);
                    if ((argv[argc] = (char *)webcgi_get(s)) == NULL) break;
                }
                api->exec(argc, argv);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}

```

The `wo_update` function will take an `exec` parameter, used to specify which `asp api` to call, and a variable number of parameters based on the `asp api` to be called.
We are going to focus on the `notice` `asp api`. The function responsible for performing the `notice` action is called `asp_notice`:

```
void asp_notice(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char s[64];
    char buf[2048];

    if (argc != 1)
        return;

    snprintf(s, sizeof(s), "/var/notice/%s", argv[0]);                                                  [1]
    if (f_read_string(s, buf, sizeof(buf)) <= 0)                                                        [2]
        return;

    web_putj(buf);
}

```

The function takes one argument. This function will take the argument passed (effectively a filename) and use it at `[1]` to compose the string `/var/notice/<argument passed>`. The composed string is used, at `[2]`, as argument of the `f_read_string` function, which will open the file and read its contents. Eventually, if the file exist, the `asp_notice` function will print out its contents.

The problem is that from `wo_update` up to the instruction at `[2]` no sanitization of the filename parameter is performed. If the `/var/notice` folder does exist, it would be possible to perform a path traversal to read any file in the file system.
