- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The iDRAC Service Module contains an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, which could be exploited by a local attacker to read memory outside of allocated buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have privileged access to the system. User interaction is also required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have privileged local access to the system and needs to perform a specific action in order to trigger the vulnerability.
