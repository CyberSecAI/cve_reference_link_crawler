The provided content relates to CVE-2021-47618.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a conflict between Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) and kprobes on ARM32 architecture. Kprobes uses software simulation to emulate instructions, which involves setting up an execution environment by binding registers. When KASAN is enabled, it interferes with this register binding process, leading to instruction simulation errors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incompatibility between KASAN and kprobe instruction emulation on ARM32.
- Destruction of register binding relationships by KASAN during kprobe emulation.
- Incorrect memory access during instruction simulation due to KASAN interference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel panic.
- System instability.
- Potential denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Inserting a kprobe on ARM32 architecture while KASAN is enabled.
- Triggering the kprobe, which then leads to the flawed instruction simulation.
- Specifically, when emulating `ldr` instruction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to insert a kprobe in the kernel.
- The target system must be ARM32 architecture with both KASAN and kprobes enabled.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue occurs within the `emulate_ldr` function, which is used to simulate the `ldr` instruction when a kprobe is placed on it.
- The problem manifests because KASAN instrumentation introduces calls to `__asan_load4` which interfere with the register setup required for instruction emulation.
- The kprobe emulation code is located in `actions-common.c`, `actions-arm.c`, and `actions-thumb.c`.
- The fix disables KASAN for these files, preventing the interference.
- The kernel log provides a detailed call stack showing the execution path leading to the NULL pointer dereference, including the affected functions: `cap_capable`, `emulate_ldr`, `kprobe_handler`, `kprobe_trap_handler`, `do_undefinstr`, and others.
