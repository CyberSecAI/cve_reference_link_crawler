Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a signed integer overflow in the `buffer_copy_string_len` function within the `burl.c` file of lighttpd. This occurs when processing a request with the `url-path-2f-decode` option enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The `buffer_copy_string_len` function performs a subtraction operation on two variables (`rlen` and `plen`). When `plen` is greater than `rlen`, this results in a signed integer overflow, leading to a large positive number. This incorrect length value is then used in `memmove` leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash and subsequent exit of the lighttpd server due to an `abort()` call. This leads to a denial of service as the server becomes unavailable to process requests.
*   **No Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability doesn't allow for arbitrary code execution. The crash is the result of a failed assertion or realloc and is handled with an abort.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request that triggers the vulnerability when the `url-path-2f-decode` is enabled. The crafted URL involves sequences such as `%2F` (URL encoded forward slash) that are processed and decoded.
*   **Network-based attack:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted server.
*   **Vulnerable Server Configuration:** The `url-path-2f-decode` option in the server configuration must be explicitly enabled to trigger the vulnerability. This feature is not enabled by default.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is triggered by the following code: `buffer_copy_string_len(con->uri.query, qstr + 1, rlen - plen - 1);` where `rlen - plen - 1` results in a negative number which is then converted to large positive number due to integer overflow.
*   The specific input that triggers the vulnerability involves URLs with sequences like `/` or `%2F`, particularly within the query string. The `burl_normalize_path` function is involved in the processing of these sequences when the `url-path-2f-decode` option is enabled.
*   The fix addresses the overflow vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in lighttpd version 1.4.54.
