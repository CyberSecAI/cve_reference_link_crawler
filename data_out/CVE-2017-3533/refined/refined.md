Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2017-3533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a newline injection flaw in the FTP client implementation within the Networking component of OpenJDK. This means that the FTP client does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject newline characters into FTP commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The primary vulnerability is a newline injection. The lack of proper input sanitization or validation when constructing FTP commands allows for the injection of newline characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to manipulate FTP connections established by a Java application. This could include:
    - Executing arbitrary FTP commands on the server.
    - Changing the directory on the FTP server and accessing unauthorized files.
    - Potentially modifying existing files or uploading malicious ones.
    - Disruption of service by manipulating the FTP connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote, leveraging the vulnerable FTP client implementation within Java applications. 
- An attacker can inject newline characters into the input that is used to construct the FTP commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a network position where they can interact with a Java application that uses the vulnerable FTP client.
- They must have the ability to influence the input to the application in a way that allows them to inject newline characters.
- The attacker could exploit this vulnerability from a malicious website by making a user visit it while having the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes**

- Multiple documents refer to this CVE impacting "OpenJDK" meaning it is a vulnerability in the open source version of Java and also present in IBM and Oracle versions.
- The vulnerability is described as "Moderate" in severity by Red Hat, however, "Important" in severity by Oracle.
- The vulnerability can be triggered from a malicious website if the icedtea-web plugin is installed by simply visiting the malicious website.
- The fix involves the removal of MD5 as a supported hashing algorithm when verifying JAR files to prevent the injection of malicious code via modified JAR files.
- The vulnerability is also present in the SMTP client implementation in OpenJDK, as described by CVE-2017-3544.
- The Red Hat advisory for java-1.8.0-openjdk (RHSA-2017:1108) provides a mitigation for NTLM connection re-use, but does not disable caching by default. This is a related, but separate, issue to CVE-2017-3533.
- The fix for this CVE was included in the update to java-1.7.0-openjdk, java-1.8.0-openjdk, java-1.6.0-ibm, java-1.7.0-ibm, java-1.8.0-ibm, java-1.6.0-sun, and java-1.8.0-oracle.
