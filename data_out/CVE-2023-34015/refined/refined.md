- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation involves tricking a logged-in user into performing actions through a malicious request.
