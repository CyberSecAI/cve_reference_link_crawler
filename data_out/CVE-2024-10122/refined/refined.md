Based on the provided information, this content relates to a vulnerability, but not necessarily CVE-2024-10122 as there is no CVE ID mentioned in the provided text.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Top Data Inner Rep Plus Web Server v.2.01 displays operator passwords in plaintext within the browser when an admin user views the operator list. Even though the credentials are encrypted during transmission, they are not masked in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Missing Password Field Masking: The primary vulnerability is the lack of masking of password fields in the browser's user interface.
*   Exposure of plaintext passwords: Despite transmitting operator data encrypted, the application exposes the passwords in cleartext within the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized access: A malicious actor can obtain operator passwords and use them to impersonate authorized users.
*   Arbitrary actions: By using the compromised credentials, the attacker can execute actions with the privileges of the targeted operator account.
*   Compromise of the system: As operators are likely to have elevated privileges, an attacker can cause damage to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Web Browser: An attacker with access to the web interface as an admin user can view and obtain the operator's plaintext passwords via the browser.
*   Network proximity: An attacker with access to the admin user's browser session or potentially through man-in-the-middle attacks, can obtain these passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Administrative access: The attacker must have administrative access to the Top Data Inner Rep Plus web interface.
*   Browser access: The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface and view the operator list.
