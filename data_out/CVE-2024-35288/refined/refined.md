Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the unsafe use of custom actions within the MSI installer of Nitro PDF Pro during repair mode. Specifically, the MSI installer executes `certutil.exe` with elevated privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) to add certificates, which allows an attacker to gain an elevated command prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe MSI Custom Actions:** The MSI installer's custom actions, intended for repair operations, execute `certutil.exe` with SYSTEM privileges in a way that can be exploited.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization or Validation:** The custom actions do not properly validate the execution context or prevent manipulation, allowing an attacker to inject commands.
*   **Insecure File Operations:** The installer attempts to add certificate files from the installation directory without proper checks, allowing an attacker to interfere with these file operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low-privileged access can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Once the attacker has SYSTEM privileges, they can execute arbitrary code, install malware, access sensitive data, and completely compromise the system.
*  **Persistent Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited any time after software installation due to the cached MSI installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows system where Nitro PDF Pro is installed.
*   **MSI Installer Manipulation:** The attacker leverages the cached MSI installer and its repair functionality.
*   **File Operation Locking:** The attacker uses `SetOpLock.exe` to interrupt the installer’s `certutil.exe` execution flow.
*  **Browser Interaction**: The attacker needs to open the "Legacyconsolemode" link in the conhost window using a browser other than Edge/IE, and then use the browser to run a command line

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User Access:** The attacker must have a user account with standard privileges on the target Windows system.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:** The attacker must be able to run commands via the command line or a scripting environment.
*   **Knowledge of MSI Installer Mechanics:** The attacker needs to know how to trigger MSI repair mode via `msiexec.exe`.
*   **Use of External Tool:** The attacker must be able to use a tool like `SetOpLock.exe` to lock file operations.
*  **Browser access and manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate browser windows.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user executes the MSI installer in repair mode via the command `msiexec.exe /fa C:\Installer\<installer name>.msi`.
*   The attack requires a browser other than Edge or Internet Explorer to open the “Legacyconsolemode” link in the conhost window.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Nitro PDF Pro versions 14.26.1.0 and 13.70.8.82 and later.
