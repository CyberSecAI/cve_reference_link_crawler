```
As per the below, method match should be considered before the largest
of header/query param matches. This commit is to consider method attr
into sorting rule.

# Gateway API route matching order contradicts specification

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-qcm3-7879-xcww
Aug 15, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

1.16.0
>= 1.15.0, < 1.15.8

## Patched versions

1.16.1
1.15.8

## Description

### Impact

Gateway API HTTPRoutes and GRPCRoutes do not follow the match precedence specified in the Gateway API specification. In particular, request headers are matched before request methods, when the specification describes that the request methods must be respected before headers are matched ([HTTPRouteRule](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRouteRule), [GRPCRouteRule](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io%2fv1.GRPCRouteRule)).

If users create Gateway API resources that use both request headers and request methods in order to route to different destinations, then traffic may be delivered to the incorrect backend. If the backend does not have Network Policy restricting acceptable traffic to receive, then requests may access information that you did not intend for them to access.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in [#34109](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/34109).

This issue affects:

* Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.7 inclusive
* Cilium v1.16.0

This issue is fixed in:

* Cilium v1.15.8
* Cilium v1.16.1

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this issue.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Cure53 and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@sayboras](https://github.com/sayboras) for remediating this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
