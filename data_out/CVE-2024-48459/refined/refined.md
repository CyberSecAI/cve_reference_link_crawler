Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `formLanCfgSet` function within the `libgo.so` library of Tenda routers. Specifically, the `lan.ip` and `lan.mask` parameters received via HTTP requests are not validated before being passed to the `SetValue` function. Later, these values are used in `doSystemCmd` which uses `system` call without any validation, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection vulnerability. The router directly uses attacker-controlled input for the `lan.ip` and `lan.mask` parameters within shell commands executed by the `system` call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router with the highest privileges (root).
- **Shell Access:** This can lead to gaining a reverse shell on the device, granting the attacker full control over the router's file system.
- **Device Compromise:** This can further allow for data exfiltration, network manipulation or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via crafted HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface, specifically the `formLanCfgSet` CGI endpoint.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to inject malicious shell commands within the `lan.ip` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Tenda router.
- **Authentication:** Although the provided exploit code includes login, the vulnerability itself exists after successful authentication; therefore, an authorized user with the ability to modify network settings can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to construct specific HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload, including valid session details.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Models:** The vulnerability affects models AX2 Pro, WIFI6L Pro, and AX2L Pro.
- **Affected Firmware:** Several firmware versions are vulnerable, including V16.03.29.50, V16.03.29.48, V16.03.29.45, V16.03.29.36, V16.03.29.33 and V16.03.29.30.
- **Exploit Code:** The provided Python script demonstrates a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit for the vulnerability, including steps for authentication, sending the malicious payload, and establishing a reverse shell.
