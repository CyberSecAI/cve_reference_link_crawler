# Malicious projects or extensions can read and upload arbitrary files from disk

Moderate

[GarboMuffin](/GarboMuffin)
published
GHSA-wg4p-vj7h-q82q
Aug 17, 2023

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.8.0

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

### Impact

TurboWarp Desktop versions prior to version 1.8.0 allowed a malicious project or malicious custom extension (sandboxed or unsandboxed) to silently read arbitrary files from disk and upload them to a remote server due to the desktop app allowing unrestricted access to `file://` and allowing unrestricted network access. The only required user interaction is opening the sb3 file or loading the extension. Pressing the green flag is not necessary.

The web version of TurboWarp is not affected.

### Patches

The `file://` access bug is resolved on TurboWarp Desktop 1.8.0 and later. Manually updating is likely to be required as many official distribution channels do not support automatic updates.

Additional mitigations are being developed for future versions.

### Workarounds

Avoid opening sb3 files or loading custom extensions from untrusted sources such as those sent over chat messaging apps.

### References

* This was originally intended to be fixed by [f0f82aa](https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/f0f82aaf6cc8170e9da8b36953c98bfe533c019f) but was reverted by [a62dbd7](https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/a62dbd7a28b41857e3b6f32443fda0527d493267) for causing regressions
* It was ultimately fixed by [55e07e9](https://github.com/TurboWarp/desktop/commit/55e07e99b59db334d75e8f46792a1569ab0884a6)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
