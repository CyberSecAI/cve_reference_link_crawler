## Installation

Go to Plugins > Add New and search for aThemes Starter Sites. Install and activate it.

## FAQ

### Will this Starter Site plugin work with my theme?

The starter sites are built using Sydney, Botiga and Airi. We suggest picking your favourite and using that.

### Are there any FREE starter sites?

You will get several FREE pre-made websites. There are many more premium starters that can be accessed when you purchase our PRO version.

### Can I import a starter site on an existing website?

It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding settings and page design. However, a page template can be imported on an existing website as well.

### Do I need to install any other plugin before importing a starter site?

All you need to do is install the Starter Sites plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.

### Will you add more starter sites?

Yes, of course! We are working on many more free and pro starter demos.

This plugin sounds great, but nowhere in the description does it mention that you need to have an aThemes theme installed to use these starter sites! If you dig down into the FAQs it does mention it, but it would save a lot of frustration if it was mentioned in the main description!I haven’t tried either the aThemes Starter Sites plugin or the aThemes Themes, and they may well be great, but the Starter Sites plugin wasn’t what I needed, and I had to install, activate, then de-activate, delete the plugin, then go back and check the FAQs to find out that it worked with their theme! I respectfully suggest that you rewrite the main description and make this little fact more obvious if you want people to take your products seriously.
