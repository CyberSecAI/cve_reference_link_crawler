PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Simcenter STAR-CCM+ is a multiphysics computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) software for the simulation
of products operating under real-world conditions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43517

The affected application improperly assigns ﬁle permissions to installation folders.

This could allow a local attacker with an unprivileged account to override or modify the service
executables and subsequently gain elevated privileges.
