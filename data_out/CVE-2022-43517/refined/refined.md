- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application improperly assigns file permissions to installation folders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission assignment for critical resources (CWE-732). Specifically, non-administrative users have write permissions on files and folders located under the installation path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker with an unprivileged account can override or modify the service executables, and subsequently gain elevated privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a local unprivileged account on the system where Simcenter STAR-CCM+ is installed.
