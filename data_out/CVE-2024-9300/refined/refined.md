Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9300

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data within the `admin/inquiries/index.php` file of the Sourcecodester Online Railway Reservation System. Specifically, the code `<?= ucwords($row['fullname']) ?>, <?= ($row['email']) ?>, and <?= ($row['message']) ?>` directly outputs user input without sanitizing it, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `admin/inquiries/index.php` file.
- The application does not sanitize user inputs before displaying them on the admin interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `contact_us.php` form (full name and message fields).
- When an administrator visits the `admin/inquiries/index.php` page to view the inquiries, the injected JavaScript code is executed within the admin's browser session.
- The attacker can steal the admin's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and further compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `contact_us.php` form, where a user can submit an inquiry containing malicious JavaScript code in the `full name` or `message` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and submit a form on the `/orrs/?page=contact_us` page of the application
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated
- The attacker does not require any special privileges

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability is specifically located in the admin panel where inquiries are displayed. The admin user is the target of this vulnerability
