- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper storage of sensitive API keys within a custom metadata object (`Apttus_DocuApi__DocusignAuthentication__mdt`) in the Conga Docusign API package for Salesforce.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure storage of API keys in a publicly accessible custom metadata object.
    - Lack of proper access controls on the custom metadata object, allowing unauthorized users to read sensitive data.
    - Use of default settings during package installation, making the object accessible to all users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Complete compromise of the Docusign account, as the disclosed API keys can be used to create a valid session.
    - Potential for attackers to re-authenticate as specific users within the Docusign account due to the admin service account's permissions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to examine the custom metadata record.
    - Direct access to the metadata object through the Salesforce platform, due to insecure default configurations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to access the custom metadata records, which can be achieved by simply being a user on the Salesforce instance with default installation settings.
    - Knowledge of the API session creation process to use disclosed API keys.
    - Ability to send a HTTP request to obtain the information.
