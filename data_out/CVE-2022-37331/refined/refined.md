Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-37331:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `GaussianOutputFormat::ReadMolecule` function within `formats/gaussformat.cpp` of Open Babel.
- An out-of-bounds write occurs due to improper handling of string concatenation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `coords_type` buffer, declared on the stack with a size of 25 bytes, is overflowed.
- The `strncpy` function does not ensure null-termination, which is a separate issue, but not the direct cause of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of Gaussian file format.
- Specifically, the code reads lines from the input file looking for lines containing `"orientation:"`.
- It then extracts the first token of this line and copies it to `coords_type`.
- Subsequently, it uses `strcat` to concatenate `" orientation:"` to `coords_type`, causing a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the stack layout and compilation details.
-  A specially crafted malformed Gaussian file can trigger this issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious file:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Gaussian file as input to the vulnerable application (Open Babel)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted Gaussian file to a system that is using a vulnerable version of Open Babel.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is triggered during file parsing, prior to any authentication checks.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a Gaussian file with the `GaussianOutputFormat::ReadMolecule` function.
- The `obabel` tool can be used to trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious Gaussian file.
- The vulnerable code attempts to identify the coordinate system used in the file by scanning for the "orientation:" string and reading the coordinate type.
- `strncpy` is used to copy the coordinate type string (first token of the line), but the destination buffer `coords_type` can be overflown due to the subsequent `strcat` operation.
