Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function of the Tenda AX1806 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `password` parameter, received via a POST request, is copied into a fixed-size buffer (`dest`) on the stack using `strcpy`. The size of `dest` is 128 bytes. There is no check on the size of the `password` parameter before copying it to `dest`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- By providing a password longer than 128 bytes, an attacker can overwrite the stack, which can lead to:
    - **Code execution**: Overwriting the return address on the stack could potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    - **Denial of service:** Overwriting critical data on the stack could crash the device or lead to other unpredictable behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/execCommand` with a `password` parameter that exceeds 128 bytes. The `password` is sent within the cookie header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which implies network accessibility, often within the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- No authentication is explicitly required to trigger this specific vulnerability.
