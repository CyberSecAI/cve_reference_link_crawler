Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Affected Software:** Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System v1.0

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `save_users()` function in `Users.php` is vulnerable.
- The application doesn't implement CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to validate the origin of requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify an existing user's details, including the administrator's password.
- In the provided PoC, the attacker can change the administrator's password to "admin", effectively taking over the admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable `Users.php?f=save` endpoint.
- The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into opening this malicious HTML page.
- The victim's browser, upon opening the page, automatically sends the crafted request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host the crafted HTML page.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the system, but requires an authenticated victim.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided PoC uses `XMLHttpRequest` to send a `POST` request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The `Content-Type` is set to `multipart/form-data`, which is used to modify the user data, in this case, the admin user.
- The POST data contains fields for user details (`id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `username`, `password`, and `img`). The attacker sets a new password for the admin user.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable function is `save_users()` in `/employee_gatepass/classes/Users.php`.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to change the admin password to "admin".
- The vulnerability exists in version v1.0 of the Employee and Visitor Gate Pass Logging System.
