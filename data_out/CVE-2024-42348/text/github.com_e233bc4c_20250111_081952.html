PoC launched, FOG server is https://192.168.0.138/fog/
1.) Search for an existing image present on the server...
   -> Image found "Win10_x64_v2", ID : 1
2.) Create a new computer in the database, with MAC+Name:01:CA:FE:AC:AA:65 ...
   -> Done, with imaging!
3.) Scrape AD parameters...

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
