- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the `_http_wsche_saveAssocSsid` function, specifically in the handling of the `profile` parameter when processing HTTP POST requests to `/data/scheduler.association.json`. The vulnerability arises due to the use of `strcpy_until` and `strncpy` without proper bounds checking, leading to uncontrolled memory writes.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow: The `strcpy_until` function copies data from the request parameters (`ssid`, `band`, `profile`, `action`) into stack-allocated buffers (`ssid_copy`, `band_copy`, `profile_copy`, `action_copy`) without proper size checks.
    - Unbounded `strncpy` usage: After the initial copy, `strncpy` copies data from the `_copy` buffers into the `wrpOpDo_params` structure without validating input lengths. This leads to overflows in the `wrpOpDo_params` structure.
    - Lack of input validation: The application does not validate the lengths of the `ssid`, `band`, `profile`, and `action` parameters before copying them into fixed-size buffers.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote code execution: An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, potentially including the return address, to gain control of code execution on the device.
    - Denial of service: The overflow can cause the `httpd_portal` service to crash.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending an authenticated HTTP POST request to the `/data/scheduler.association.json` endpoint with overly long `ssid`, `band`, `profile`, or `action` parameters.
    - The `operation` parameter must have a value other than "read" or "load" to trigger the vulnerable code path.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes**:
- The report covers multiple CVEs, each related to a different parameter involved in the same overflow.
- The report details the differences in how the vulnerability manifests in EAP225 and EAP115 devices, especially with respect to the use of pointers when copying data to `wrpOpDo_params`.
- The report provides specific vulnerable function offsets within the `httpd_portal` and `httpd` binaries for the affected firmware versions.
- The report includes a crash information excerpt showing the result of an overflow, leading to a segmentation fault.
