Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20614:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly mentions `CVE-2022-20614` in relation to the Jenkins Mailer Plugin.
   - The description aligns with the vulnerability information available from the CVE description, confirming that the content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   * **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
     - The Mailer Plugin's form validation method does not enforce permission checks and does not require POST requests.

   * **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - **Missing permission check:** A method in the Mailer Plugin lacks proper checks to ensure only authorized users can perform the action.
     - **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

   * **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - An attacker with Overall/Read access can utilize the Jenkins instance's DNS resolver to resolve an attacker-specified hostname.
     - The CSRF vulnerability allows attackers to execute actions without the user's knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized DNS lookups.

   * **Attack Vectors:**
     - **Network-based attack:** An attacker can make requests over the network.
     - **Exploiting the vulnerability:** An attacker crafts a malicious request to exploit the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability.

   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - **Overall/Read access:** The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
     - **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins instance.

**3. Additional Details:**
   - The vulnerability exists in Mailer Plugin versions up to and including 391.ve4a\_38c1b\_cf4b\_.
   - The fix is provided in Mailer Plugin version 408.vd726a\_1130320, which requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

**4. Summary of Technical Details:**
   - The primary vulnerability is the lack of access control and CSRF protection in the form validation method of the Mailer Plugin. This allows a read-level user to use the Jenkins server's DNS resolver by sending an HTTP request to the server, potentially leaking internal hostname information.
   - The lack of CSRF protection means that the attacker can perform this action on behalf of a legitimate user without their awareness.

**5. Summary of Fix:**
   - The fix requires users to use a newer version of the Mailer Plugin that enforces permissions and CSRF protection, ensuring only those with the Overall/Administer permission can use the affected form validation method and that they are using a POST request.
