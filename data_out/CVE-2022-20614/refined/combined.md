## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### CSRF vulnerability in build triggers

**SECURITY-2558
/
CVE-2022-20612**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.329 and earlier, LTS 2.319.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint handling manual build requests when no security realm is set, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger build of job without parameters.

Jenkins 2.330, LTS 2.319.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Mailer Plugin

**SECURITY-2163
/
CVE-2022-20613 (CSRF), CVE-2022-20614 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

Mailer Plugin 391.ve4a\_38c1b\_cf4b\_ and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to use the DNS used by the Jenkins instance to resolve an attacker-specified hostname.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Mailer Plugin 408.vd726a\_1130320 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Matrix Project Plugin

**SECURITY-2017
/
CVE-2022-20615**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`matrix-project`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-project)**

**Description:**

Matrix Project Plugin 1.19 and earlier does not escape HTML metacharacters in node and label names, and label descriptions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure permission.

Matrix Project Plugin 1.20 escapes HTML metacharacters in node and label names, and label descriptions.

### Missing permission check in Credentials Binding Plugin allows validating secret file credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2342
/
CVE-2022-20616**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.27 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to validate if a credential ID refers to a secret file credential and whether it’s a zip file.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.27.1 performs permission checks when validating secret file credentials IDs.

### OS command execution vulnerability in Docker Commons Plugin

**SECURITY-1878
/
CVE-2022-20617**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-commons`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-commons)**

**Description:**

Docker Commons Plugin 1.17 and earlier does not sanitize the name of an image or a tag.

This results in an OS command execution vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission or able to control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

Docker Commons Plugin 1.18 sanitizes the name of an image or a tag.

### Missing permission checks in Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin allow enumerating credentials IDs

CVE-2022-20618**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source)**

**Description:**

Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 746.v350d2781c184 requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability in Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin allows capturing credentials

**SECURITY-2467
/
CVE-2022-20619**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source)**

**Description:**

Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 746.v350d2781c184 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

### Missing permission checks in SSH Agent Plugin allow enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2189
/
CVE-2022-20620**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ssh-agent`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-agent)**

**Description:**

SSH Agent Plugin 1.23 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in SSH Agent Plugin 1.23.2 requires the appropriate permissions.

### Access key stored in plain text by Metrics Plugin

**SECURITY-1624
/
CVE-2022-20621**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`metrics`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics)**

**Description:**

Metrics Plugin 4.0.2.8 and earlier stores access keys unencrypted in its global configuration file `jenkins.metrics.api.MetricsAccessKey.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This access key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Metrics Plugin 4.0.2.8.1 stores access key encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

Additionally, the token value is only displayed once when it is generated.

### User passwords transmitted in plain text by Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-1389
/
CVE-2022-23105**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

Active Directory Plugin 2.25 and earlier does not encrypt the transmission of data between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers unless it is configured to use the OS agnostic LDAP mode and the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` is set to `true`.

This allows attackers able to capture network traffic between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers to obtain credentials of users logging into Jenkins, as well as credentials of the manager DN (LDAP mode) or the Windows/Active Directory user Jenkins is running as (ADSI mode).

Active Directory Plugin 2.25.1 adds an option to only connect to Active Directory via TLS/SSL to both modes (ADSI and LDAP).
This option is enabled by default for new installations and is now the recommended way to enforce TLS/SSL for connections to Active Directory.
Unlike the existing StartTLS option for the LDAP-based mode, it will not proceed using an insecure connection if establishing a TLS/SSL connection fails.

Administrators upgrading from previous versions of the plugin will be shown a warning on the Jenkins UI requesting they update the plugin configuration unless the (now otherwise obsolete) flag `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` was set to `true`.

|  | The plugin exposes configuration of the ADSI flags implementing the TLS/SSL requirement via the system properties `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_FLAGS_OVERRIDE` and `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_PASSWORDLESS_FLAGS_OVERRIDE`. See the plugin documentation for further details. |
| --- | --- |

|  | Care needs to be taken when reconfiguring the security realm to not accidentally lock yourself out. See [the documentation](/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/) for advice how to resolve this problem if it occurs. |

### Non-constant time token comparison in Configuration as Code Plugin

**SECURITY-2141
/
CVE-2022-23106**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.55 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two authentication tokens are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid authentication token.

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.55.1 now uses a constant-time comparison when validating authentication tokens.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-2090
/
CVE-2022-23107**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin 9.10.2 and earlier does not restrict the name of a file when configuring a custom ID.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to write and read specific files with a hard-coded suffix on the Jenkins controller file system.

Warnings Plugin 9.10.3 checks for the presence of prohibited directory separator characters in the custom ID.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Badge Plugin

**SECURITY-2547
/
CVE-2022-23108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`badge`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/badge)**

**Description:**

Badge Plugin allows adding custom build badges with a custom description and optionally a link to a URL.

Badge Plugin 1.9 and earlier does not escape the description and does not check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Badge Plugin 1.9.1 escapes the description and check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

### Improper credentials masking in HashiCorp Vault Plugin

**SECURITY-2213
/
CVE-2022-23109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hashicorp-vault-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hashicorp-vault-plugin)**

**Description:**

Pipelines display commands executed in their Pipeline step descriptions and their output in build logs.
To mask sensitive output, [Pipeline: Groovy Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps) 2.84 and earlier specified an allowlist of known non-sensitive variables and masked everything else.
This caused problems, so Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.85 and newer expects pipeline steps to explicitly specify that variables are to be treated as sensitive and should be removed from output.

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier relied on the previous behavior and did not explicitly declare variables as sensitive or redacted them.

This can result in exposure of Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0 explicitly masks Vault credentials in build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

This fix only applies to new builds.
Administrators are advised to review build logs and Pipeline metadata files created before HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.8.0 for the presence of Vault credentials.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Publish Over SSH Plugin

**SECURITY-2287
/
CVE-2022-23110**

SECURITY-2558 / CVE-2022-20612
Jenkins 2.329 and earlier, LTS 2.319.1 and earlier does not require POST
requests for the HTTP endpoint handling manual build requests when no
security realm is set, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger build of job without
parameters.

SECURITY-2163 / CVE-2022-20613 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-20614 (missing permission
check)
Mailer Plugin 391.ve4a_38c1b_cf4b_ and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to use the DNS used by the
Jenkins instance to resolve an attacker-specified hostname.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-2017 / CVE-2022-20615
Matrix Project Plugin 1.19 and earlier does not escape HTML metacharacters
in node and label names, and label descriptions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Agent/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2342 / CVE-2022-20616
Credentials Binding Plugin 1.27 and earlier does not perform a permission
check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to validate if a credential
ID refers to a secret file credential and whether it's a zip file.

SECURITY-1878 / CVE-2022-20617
Docker Commons Plugin 1.17 and earlier does not sanitize the name of an
image or a tag.

This results in an OS command execution vulnerability exploitable by
attackers with Item/Configure permission or able to control the contents of
a previously configured job's SCM repository.

SECURITY-2033 / CVE-2022-20618
Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlier does not
perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs
of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to
capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-2467 / CVE-2022-20619
Bitbucket Branch Source Plugin 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlier does not
require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2189 / CVE-2022-20620
SSH Agent Plugin 1.23 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials IDs
of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to
capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1624 / CVE-2022-20621
Metrics Plugin 4.0.2.8 and earlier stores access keys unencrypted in its
global configuration file `jenkins.metrics.api.MetricsAccessKey.xml` on the
Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This access key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins
controller file system.

SECURITY-1389 / CVE-2022-23105
Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: integration with
ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

Active Directory Plugin 2.25 and earlier does not encrypt the transmission
of data between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers unless
it is configured to use the OS agnostic LDAP mode and the system property
`hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps`
is set to `true`.

This allows attackers able to capture network traffic between the Jenkins
controller and Active Directory servers to obtain credentials of users
logging into Jenkins, as well as credentials of the manager DN (LDAP mode)
or the Windows/Active Directory user Jenkins is running as (ADSI mode).

SECURITY-2141 / CVE-2022-23106
Configuration as Code Plugin 1.55 and earlier does not use a constant-time
comparison when checking whether two authentication tokens are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid authentication token.

SECURITY-2090 / CVE-2022-23107
Warnings Next Generation Plugin 9.10.2 and earlier does not restrict the
name of a file when configuring a custom ID.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to write and read
specific files with a hard-coded suffix on the Jenkins controller file
system.

SECURITY-2547 / CVE-2022-23108
Badge Plugin allows adding custom build badges with a custom description
and optionally a link to a URL.

Badge Plugin 1.9 and earlier does not escape the description and does not
check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2213 / CVE-2022-23109
Pipelines display commands executed in their Pipeline step descriptions and
their output in build logs. To mask sensitive output,
Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.84 and earlier specified an
allowlist of known non-sensitive variables and masked everything else. This
caused problems, so Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.85 and newer expects pipeline
steps to explicitly specify that variables are to be treated as sensitive
and should be removed from output.

HashiCorp Vault Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier relied on the previous behavior
and did not explicitly declare variables as sensitive or redacted them.

This can result in exposure of Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs and
Pipeline step descriptions.

SECURITY-2287 / CVE-2022-23110
Publish Over SSH Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not escape the SSH server
name.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Overall/Administer permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2290 / CVE-2022-23111 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-23112 (missing permission
check)
Publish Over SSH Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in methods implementing connection tests.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to connect to an
attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, these connection tests methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2307 / CVE-2022-23113
Publish Over SSH Plugin 1.22 and earlier performs a validation of the file
name specifying whether it is present or not.

This results in a path traversal vulnerability allowing attackers with
Item/Configure permission to discover the name of the Jenkins controller
files.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2291 / CVE-2022-23114
Publish Over SSH Plugin 1.22 and earlier stores password unencrypted in its
global configuration file
`jenkins.plugins.publish_over_ssh.BapSshPublisherPlugin.xml` on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1025 / CVE-2022-23115
batch task Plugin 1.19 and earlier does not require POST requests for
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with Overall/Read access to retrieve
logs, build or delete a batch task.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2522 (1) / CVE-2022-23116
Conjur Secrets Plugin 1.0.9 and earlier implements functionality that
allows agent processes to obtain the plain text of any attacker-provided
encrypted secret.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to decrypt secrets
stored in Jenkins obtained through another method.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2522 (2) / CVE-2022-23117
Conjur Secrets Plugin 1.0.9 and earlier implements functionality that
allows agent processes to obtain all username/password credentials
(Credentials Plugin) stored on the Jenkins controller.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to retrieve those
credentials.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2546 / CVE-2022-23118
Debian Package Builder Plugin 1.6.11 and earlier implements functionality
that allows agent processes to invoke command-line `git` at an
attacker-specified path on the controller.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to invoke arbitrary
OS commands on the controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
