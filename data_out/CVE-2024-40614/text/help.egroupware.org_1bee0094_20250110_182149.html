Hello everybody,

we have released a new maintenance and **security release**.

> ![:warning:](//help.egroupware.org/images/emoji/twitter/warning.png?v=5 ":warning:") We do not publish security updates for version 21.1 and before!
>
> If you are not running EGroupware version 23.1, you should (finally) upgrade to 23.1!

Changelog:

* Mail: fix broken PDF attachments which were quoted-printable encoded
* Mail: do not stall (quick-)preview on mails without text-part e.g. PDF only
* Mail: allow to edit/fix mail account if no session password is available e.g. SAML or OpenID Connect SSO login
* Filemanager: automatic shorten too long filenames and replace 4-byte utf-8 characters, which gave an error when trying to store VFS
* Calendar: fix editing recurring events of type RDATE/explicit dates
* Calendar: fix generating/importing exceptions on recurring events using explicit RDATEs instead of a RRULE
* CalDAV/CardDAV/REST API: fix not working limited result
* eSync: fix whole-day events were one day longer (shifted by timezone difference)
* eSync/Mail/Calendar: limit request for all mail and events to 1 year back, instead of previous 178 or 100 days
* eSyncPro/EPL: fix provisioning loop cause by wrong timezone conversation
* Calendar/eSync/EPL: better cope with Android bug reporting always 1st of current month as cutoffdate, if a policy is given: use setting of default policy instead
* Resources: fix category-name not shown in edit, if user has no edit rights to the resources
* Resources: fix editing on mobile devices gave a template error
* ProjectManager: if sorting element-list by start, end, budget, time or quantity: consider both varieties, but prefer the requested one
* **InfoLog: now fully supported by REST API**
* **Many translations**

This maintenance update does not yet contain the changes that we announced in the newsletter:

![:uk:](//help.egroupware.org/images/emoji/twitter/uk.png?v=5 ":uk:") [Newsletter: Simplified customizing, data security & S3, events](https://help.egroupware.org/t/uk-newsletter-simplified-customizing-data-security-s3-events/78410)

![:de:](//help.egroupware.org/images/emoji/twitter/de.png?v=5 ":de:") [Newsletter: Vereinfachtes Customizing, Datensicherheit & S3, Veranstaltungen](https://help.egroupware.org/t/de-newsletter-vereinfachtes-customizing-datensicherheit-s3-veranstaltungen/78411)

This maintenance update had to be brought forward in order to deliver security-relevant fixes.

**New functions / preferences or other important things:**

* **InfoLog: now fully supported by REST API**

We have finalised the REST API for InfoLog:

[github.com](https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/blob/master/doc/REST-CalDAV-CardDAV/Infolog.md)

#### [EGroupware/egroupware/blob/master/doc/REST-CalDAV-CardDAV/Infolog.md](https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/blob/master/doc/REST-CalDAV-CardDAV/Infolog.md)

```
# EGroupware REST API for InfoLog

Authentication is via Basic Auth with username and a password, or a token valid for:
- either just the given user or all users
- CalDAV/CardDAV Sync (REST API)
- InfoLog application

Following RFCs / drafts used/planned for JSON encoding of InfoLog entries
* [rfc8984: JSCalendar: A JSON Representation of Calendar Data](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8984)
* [links sub-collection to add attachments and links to other application-entries](Links-and-attachments.md)

### Used JSCalendar Task schema to encode InfoLog entries plus EGroupware&InfoLog specific extensions:
* stock JSCalendar Task attributes like: `uid`, `title`, `start`, ... (see above link)
* `@type` is always `Task` independent of InfoLog type, see `egroupware.org:type` below
* `progress` stock values:
  * `needs-action` (InfoLog `not-started`)
  * `in-progress` (InfoLog `ongoing`)
  * `completed` (InfoLog `done`)
  * `cancelled`
  * `egroupware.org:<infolog-status>` (all other status supported by InfoLog use a `egroupware.org:` prefix)

```

* **Many translations**

We have added many translations in many languages and also made many corrections/changes.

If something is wrong or needs improvement, please send an email to

su@egroupware.org.

We are always looking for more community translators!

Every contribution, no matter how small, makes the translations better ![:slight_smile:](//help.egroupware.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5 ":slight_smile:")
