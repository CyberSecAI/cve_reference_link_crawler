* **THIS IS A SECURITY UPDATE**: thanks to Christian Zaeske from SySS GmbH and Hochschule Magdeburg-Stendal, **please update ASAP**
* Mail: fix broken PDF attachments which were quoted-printable encoded
* Mail: do not stall (quick-)preview on mails without text-part e.g. PDF only
* Mail: allow to edit/fix mail account if no session password is available e.g. SAML or OpenID Connect SSO login
* Filemanager: automatic shorten too long filenames and replace 4-byte utf-8 characters, which gave an error when trying to store VFS
* Calendar: fix editing recurring events of type RDATE/explicit dates
* Calendar: fix generating/importing exceptions on recurring events using explicit RDATEs instead of a RRULE
* CalDAV/CardDAV/REST API: fix not working limited result
* eSync: fix whole-day events were one day longer (shifted by timezone difference)
* eSync/Mail/Calendar: limit request for all mail and events to 1 year back, instead of previous 178 or 100 days
* eSyncPro/EPL: fix provisioning loop cause by wrong timezone conversation
* Calendar/eSync/EPL: better cope with Android bug reporting always 1st of current month as cutoffdate, if a policy is given: use setting of default policy instead
* Resources: fix category-name not shown in edit, if user has no edit rights to the resources
* Resources: fix editing on mobile devices gave a template error
* ProjectManager: if sorting element-list by start, end, budget, time or quantity: consider both varieties, but prefer the requested one
* InfoLog: now fully supported by [REST API](https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/tree/master/doc/REST-CalDAV-CardDAV#rest-api-using-egroupware-caldavcarddav-server-with-json)
* Many translations
* [**Extended release notes**](https://help.egroupware.org/t/egroupware-maintenance-security-release-23-1-20240624/78438)
