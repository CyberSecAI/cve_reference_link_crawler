{
  "CVE-2017-3575": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is located in `src/VBox/Devices/Network/DevVirtioNet.cpp` in VirtualBox VMs using a virtio network adapter. The guest kernel can write up to 4GB of controlled data out-of-bounds in the trusted userland host process due to a missing overflow check during the calculation of the buffer size.",
    "Root cause": "The lengths of the IO vector elements are summed without overflow checking. If the total length of the IO vector is over 4GB, `uSize` wraps around, causing the allocated buffer to be up to 4GB smaller than the data copied into it. Also, `uOffset` is only 32 bits wide, causing the start offsets of the IO vector elements to wrap.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "The guest kernel can write up to 4GB of controlled data out of bounds in the trusted userland host process, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service on the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest can send a specially crafted IO vector to the host via the virtio network interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the guest operating system and have the ability to send network packets to the host."
