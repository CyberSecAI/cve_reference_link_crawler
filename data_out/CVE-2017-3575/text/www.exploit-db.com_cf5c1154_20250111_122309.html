**Vulnerable App:**

```
Source: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1136

This is a vulnerability that affects VirtualBox VMs that use a virtio
network adapter (which is a non-standard configuration). It permits
the guest kernel to write up to 4GB of controlled data out of bounds
in the trusted userland host process.

The bug is in the following code in
src/VBox/Devices/Network/DevVirtioNet.cpp (comments starting with
`//###` are by me):

while (vqueuePeek(&pThis->VPCI, pQueue, &elem))
{
    unsigned int uOffset = 0;
    if (elem.nOut < 2 || elem.aSegsOut[0].cb != uHdrLen)
    {
        [...]
    }
    else
    {
        unsigned int uSize = 0;
        [...]
        /* Compute total frame size. */
        //### .cb members are attacker-controlled uint32_t.
        //### addition is performed without overflow check.
        for (unsigned int i = 1; i < elem.nOut; i++)
            uSize += elem.aSegsOut[i].cb;
        [...]
        //### Assert() has no effect in release builds.
        Assert(uSize <= VNET_MAX_FRAME_SIZE);
        if (pThis->pDrv)
        {
            [...]
            PPDMSCATTERGATHER pSgBuf;
            //### undersized buffer is allocated here.
            int rc = pThis->pDrv->pfnAllocBuf(pThis->pDrv, uSize, pGso, &pSgBuf);
            if (RT_SUCCESS(rc))
            {
                Assert(pSgBuf->cSegs == 1);
                /* Assemble a complete frame. */
                for (unsigned int i = 1; i < elem.nOut; i++)
                {
                    //### memory corruption happens here.
                    PDMDevHlpPhysRead(pThis->VPCI.CTX_SUFF(pDevIns), elem.aSegsOut[i].addr,
                                      ((uint8_t*)pSgBuf->aSegs[0].pvSeg) + uOffset,
                                      elem.aSegsOut[i].cb);
                    uOffset += elem.aSegsOut[i].cb;
                }
                [...]
            }
            else
            {
                [...]
            }
            [...]
        }
    }
    [...]
}

This code basically takes an IO vector (`elem.aSegsOut`) from the
guest, allocates a buffer (`pSgBuf`) that is large enough to hold the
concatenation of all elements of the IO vector, then copies data from
the IO vector into the newly allocated buffer. The issue here is that
the lengths from the IO vector are summed up without overflow
checking. If the total length of the IO vector is over 4GB, `uSize`
wraps around, causing the allocated buffer to be up to 4GB smaller
than the data that is copied into it.

The reason why the amount of data that is written out of bounds can be
less than 4GB is that uOffset is also only 32 bits wide, causing the
start offsets of the IO vector elements to wrap.

A VM does not need to have 4GB of memory to be able to trigger the bug.

To reproduce, create a VM with 2GB of RAM, configure the VM to use
virtio, then run a Linux system with the following kernel patch
applied inside the VM:

As soon as the VM tries to talk to the network, the VM will crash.
In a test with VirtualBox 5.1.14 r112924, a segfault occured with the
following backtrace:

Regarding exploitability: I have not investigated exploitability in
detail; however, I believe that this issue is probably exploitable.
For example, if the network interface is a NAT interface,
drvNATNetworkUp_AllocBuf() is used to allocate the buffer, which in
the pGso!=NULL case will allocate an arbitrarily-sized buffer with
RTMemAlloc(), which should allow arbitrarily-sized allocations,
permitting an out-of-bounds write behind a big heap allocation with
fully controlled length and data.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
