## FAQ

### The title tag is output twice

The `title` tag output in wp\_head (`_wp_render_title_tag`) is deleted, but if it is written directly in `<head>`, it will be duplicated.

Remove the handwritten `title` tag.

### How to overwrite the output on a particular page?

Most of the output tags use filter hooks, so you can overwrite them with `add_filter`.

The following hooks are available.

* ‘ssp\_output\_title’
* ‘ssp\_output\_robots’
* ‘ssp\_output\_description’
* ‘ssp\_output\_canonical’
* ‘ssp\_output\_keyword’
* and more…

ウェブサイト運用に必要な最小限のMETAタグのカスタマイズができます。機能が最小限でわかりやすいので、ウェブ制作の初学者でも使いやすいと思います。クラシックテーマだけでなく、最新のブロックテーマでも動作します（対応いただきありがとうございます！）。
