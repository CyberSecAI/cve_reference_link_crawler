Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a "broken access control issue". This indicates a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks within a function of the WordPress Save as PDF plugin by Pdfcrowd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Broken Access Control:** Specifically, the plugin lacks proper checks to prevent unprivileged users from executing actions that should require higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the broken access control flaw within the plugin's functionality. This allows a user with "subscriber" privileges to trigger privileged actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have an account with at least "subscriber" privileges on the affected WordPress website.

**Additional Notes:**
