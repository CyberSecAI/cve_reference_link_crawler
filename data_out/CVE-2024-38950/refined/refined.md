Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `__interceptor_memcpy` function of the `libde265` library. This occurs when copying data to a destination buffer, where the size of data being copied exceeds the allocated size of the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a heap-based buffer overflow. The `memcpy` operation attempts to write beyond the bounds of a memory region allocated on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a program crash due to the memory corruption caused by the buffer overflow. This is evidenced by the AddressSanitizer (ASan) reports, which detail the overflow and lead to the program aborting.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more severe exploits like arbitrary code execution, depending on the context and memory layout. This is a potential risk, although not immediately detailed in this report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted input file processed by the `dec265` utility. The provided poc.zip and poc1.zip attachments demonstrate this. The vulnerability occurs within the library during the process of decoding an HEVC video stream.
- **Specific Function:** The overflow occurs within `__interceptor_memcpy`, which is called indirectly through `SDL_YUV_Display::display420` or `SDL_YUV_Display::display444as420`, indicating that the issue arises during display processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** An attacker would need to be able to provide a malicious HEVC video stream to an application using `libde265` to trigger the vulnerability. This means the attacker would need to control the input data being processed by the vulnerable library.
- **Target System:** The attacker needs to target systems running the vulnerable version of the library (specifically v1.0.15) and application (dec265 utility)
- **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability does not require any special privileges. It is exploitable by simply processing the malicious input through the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided ASan output gives specific memory addresses and sizes involved in the overflow, aiding in debugging and understanding the exact nature of the issue. The provided code snippets show the call stack leading to the crash.
- The issue is reproducible as demonstrated by the validation steps using the provided poc files.
- The issue was found using AFL++ fuzzer.
