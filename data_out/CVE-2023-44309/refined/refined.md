- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the fragment components. Specifically, non-HTML fields of linked source assets are not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the application, phishing attacks, or malware distribution. The impact is rated as high, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring a low level of privilege and user interaction. The vulnerability exists in fragment components and relies on injecting a crafted payload into a non-HTML field of a linked source asset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges and must be able to inject malicious code into non-HTML fields of fragment component source assets, which requires a user interaction (victim clicks link or loads page where crafted payload executed).
