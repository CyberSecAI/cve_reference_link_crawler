## FAQ

### Is Youzify FREE?

Yes! Youzify’s core features are and always will be FREE.

Most of the features that were premium for the past years are now offered for FREE for everyone and we will keep adding even more features in the future.

### Can I use my existing WordPress theme?

Yes! Youzify works out-of-the-box with nearly every WordPress theme. But you might find conflict with some themes that includes also styling for BuddyPress, in this case, we recommend reaching the theme team to add their BuddyPress styling in a separate file so we can disable it easily for you and solve this problem.

### Is Youzify works with all BuddyPress plugin?

Great question. While we haven’t tested every BuddyPress plugin, to improve the look and the functionalities of Youzify we were forced to make changes to the structure of the BuddyPress template which might affect some other BuddyPress plugins. But the good news is that our doors are open for everyone, we are open to working with any plugin team to make it compatible with Youzify as long as they want that too.

### Is BuddyPress required for Youzify to work?

Yes! Youzify is based on BuddyPress, and it requires BuddyPress to be installed and active in order to work. But you can disable any BuddyPress component you don’t want with one click.

I didn’t necessarily need a whole community, just several of the core features. I was happy that I was able to adjust this plugin for my needs. It was a total lifesaver. I highly recommend Youzify to anyone wanting to create a cool community on WordPress. It’s super easy to use and lets you customize your site to look exactly how you want. The support team is always there to help, which is a huge plus. If you’re looking to make your site more social and interactive, Youzify is the way to go!
