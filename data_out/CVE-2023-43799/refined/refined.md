Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Altair GraphQL Client Desktop Application fails to sanitize external URLs before passing them to the underlying operating system. Additionally, the renderer process isn't properly isolated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of URL Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate URLs, allowing potentially malicious URLs to be passed directly to the system.
*   **Inadequate Renderer Process Isolation:** The renderer process is not isolated, meaning code executed within it can directly interact with the underlying system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Malicious code executed in the renderer process can compromise the user's system. This includes opening files, executing applications, and potentially performing other harmful actions.
*   **System Compromise:** Due to the lack of sanitization and isolation, an attacker could potentially open arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code. This can lead to a full compromise of the user's machine

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed URLs:**  An attacker can craft malicious URLs (e.g., URLs with spaces or file:/// URIs) and inject them into the application.
*   **Renderer Process Code Injection:** By injecting code into the application's renderer process, an attacker can leverage the lack of isolation to interact directly with the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges, as the vulnerability can be exploited from within the application using the developer console.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must open the application and an attacker would need to somehow cause the malicious code to be run.
*   **Local Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited from within the application on the user's system.
*   **Developer Tools Access:** The attacker can use the developer console (or remote devtools) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in Altair Desktop Client versions prior to 5.2.5.
* The fix was included in version 5.2.5
* The affected platforms are MacOS, Windows and Linux.
* The CVSS v3 base score is 5.0, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
