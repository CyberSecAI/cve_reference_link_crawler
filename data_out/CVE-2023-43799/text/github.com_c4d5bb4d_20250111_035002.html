# The Altair Desktop Client Does Not Sanitize External URLs before passing them to the underlying system

Moderate

[imolorhe](/imolorhe)
published
GHSA-9m5v-vrf6-fmvm
Oct 2, 2023

## Package

actions

Altair desktop clients (macOS, linux, windows)
([GitHub Actions](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Aactions))

## Affected versions

< 5.2.5

## Patched versions

5.2.5

## Description

### Summary:

The Altair GraphQL Client Desktop Application does not sanitize external URLs before passing them to the underlying system. Moreover, Altair GraphQL Client also does not isolate the context of the renderer process.

### Platform(s) Affected:

MacOS, Windows, Linux

### Steps To Reproduce:

1. Open the Altair GraphQL Client Desktop Application.
2. Open the developer tools using [shortcuts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/#shortcuts) or remote devtools.
3. [Open External Site] Within the console, attempt to open a new window with a malformed URL, `window.open('https://google%20.com')`. The application does not sanitize this URL before passing it to the system.
4. [Open an executable file] Within the developer tools console, execute `window.open('file:///Applications/Emacs.app')` – observe that, if installed on the system, the Emacs app opens. Essentially, any malicious code that runs in the renderer process can compromise the user’s underlying system.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
