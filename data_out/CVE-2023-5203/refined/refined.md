- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize request URL or query parameters before using them in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated SQL injection. Specifically, blind time-based SQL injection and error/union-based SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious GET requests to the vulnerable server containing crafted SQL payloads in URL or query parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. The attacker can send unauthenticated requests to the vulnerable server from a remote position.
