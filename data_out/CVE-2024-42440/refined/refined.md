The provided content details a security bulletin (ZSB-24034) for **CVE-2024-42441**, describing a privilege escalation vulnerability in the installer for Zoom products on macOS. Hereâ€™s the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management within the installer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The installer allows a privileged user to escalate their privileges. This means a user with some elevated privileges can gain even more access than intended by exploiting the installer.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit leads to privilege escalation, where an attacker gains higher privileges than they should have. This could allow them to perform actions they are not authorized to, potentially compromising the system.

**Attack vectors:** Local access to a vulnerable macOS system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system already. The vulnerability is exploited through a local interaction, not a remote attack.
