[@pwhelan](https://github.com/pwhelan) at cursory glance, it seems to me that previous to this commit (which fixes [CVE-2024-4323](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68mr-468g-4wmg "CVE-2024-4323")), disabling the trace API endpoint(s) in the config did not actually result in the affected endpoint being disabled.

[9311b43#diff-a944a60850c06cb44a5fe5452b5f771cb40f2a1403b209e12eb15317dd0f679fR661](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/commit/9311b43a258352797af40749ab31a63c32acfd04#diff-a944a60850c06cb44a5fe5452b5f771cb40f2a1403b209e12eb15317dd0f679fR661)

> * api/v1/traces: disable traces api when tracing is disabled.

Is my understanding correct? If so, this would be problematic, since some advisories making the rounds[1](#user-content-fn-1-cf73a8fb9f8fceb15a5958c10d7f4086) [2](#user-content-fn-2-cf73a8fb9f8fceb15a5958c10d7f4086) [3](#user-content-fn-3-cf73a8fb9f8fceb15a5958c10d7f4086) [4](#user-content-fn-4-cf73a8fb9f8fceb15a5958c10d7f4086) mention disabling the tracing API as a temporary workaround until a patch for [CVE-2024-4323](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68mr-468g-4wmg "CVE-2024-4323") is deployed.
