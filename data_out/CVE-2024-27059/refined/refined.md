```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values from ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands. The calculation involves division and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of these values is 0.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Division by zero vulnerability
- Lack of proper input validation before performing division and modulus operations.

Impact of exploitation:
- Kernel crash/denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- A flawed or subversive USB device emulation can provide crafted ATA ID information with HEADS or SECTORS values set to 0.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to present a USB storage device with malicious ATA ID data to a vulnerable system.
