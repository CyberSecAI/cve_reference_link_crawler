- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Simple HTML Sitemap plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when users visit the site. This could lead to various malicious activities, including unauthorized actions, data theft, or further malware distribution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts within the plugin's functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any authentication and can inject the script without any prior access.
