Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when constructing SQL queries in the `literalizeRegexPart` function within the Postgres storage adapter of the Parse Server. Specifically, the function inadequately handles special characters within regex patterns when used with PostgreSQL, allowing for potential SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Malicious input within regex patterns bypasses sanitization and becomes part of the SQL query, potentially allowing unauthorized database access or modification.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The code fails to properly escape or sanitize all special characters that could be used to inject SQL into the database query, particularly within the `literalizeRegexPart` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have a severe impact:
- Data Breach: Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- Authentication Bypass: By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.
- Complete System Compromise: In worst-case scenarios, successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise and allow further access to underlying systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can remotely send malicious requests to the Parse Server, injecting SQL through carefully crafted regex queries.
- Input Manipulation: The attacker manipulates input provided to the Parse Server, specifically utilizing regex patterns in queries to introduce malicious SQL fragments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the Parse Server instance.
- Knowledge of Parse Server: The attacker needs to be aware that the server uses a vulnerable version of the Parse Server PostgreSQL adapter.
- Understanding of SQL and regex syntax: The attacker needs to understand how to construct malicious regex patterns that will be converted into SQL injection payloads.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, meaning any user can potentially send malicious queries.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Parse Server versions prior to 6.5.7 and versions between 7.0.0 and 7.1.0.
- Patches have been released for both the 6.x.x and 7.x.x branches to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Smile Thanapattheerakul of Trend Micro and coordinated by Manuel Trezza.
- The provided text confirms that the issue is a SQL injection vulnerability when using Parse Server with PostgreSQL.
- It is classified as Critical with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8
