Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Graylog handles user sessions in a multi-node cluster. Each node maintains an independent, in-memory cache of user sessions.
- When a user logs out, the session is removed from the local cache of the node handling the logout and deleted from the database. However, other nodes in the cluster retain their cached copy of the session.
- These cached sessions on other nodes remain valid until their original expiry time, even though the user has logged out and the session has been invalidated on the node where the logout occurred.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stale Session Cache:** The core issue is the use of independent, uncoordinated session caches across multiple nodes. This leads to inconsistencies in session state after a user logs out.
- **Lack of Session Invalidation Propagation:** The system fails to propagate session invalidation to all nodes in the cluster upon logout.
- **Bypass of Logout via API:** The vulnerability can be exploited by making API calls with the `X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true` header. This prevents the session's "last access" timestamp from being updated, which would normally trigger a check against the database and invalidate the session on other nodes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized API Access:** An attacker who has obtained a valid session ID can continue to use it for API requests, even after the user has logged out and the UI displays the login screen.
-   **Limited Time Frame:** The impact is limited to the configured session lifetime, starting from the time the user logged out.
-   **No Session ID Leakage:** The vulnerability does not leak session identifiers, requiring a compromised session to start with.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Direct API Requests:** The primary attack vector involves making direct API requests to the Graylog cluster using a previously valid session ID.
-   **`X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true` Header:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires the attacker to include the `X-Graylog-No-Session-Extension:true` header in their API request to prevent session invalidation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Compromised Session ID:** The attacker must have obtained a valid session ID of a user, before the user has logged out.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the Graylog cluster (access to the load balancer, as described in the PoC).

**Additional Details from Commit Diff:**

The provided commit `bb88f3d` includes changes to address the vulnerability. These changes consist of:

-   **Clearing Session Cache on all Nodes**: The core fix is to clear the session cache on all nodes in the cluster upon session deletion. This prevents stale sessions from remaining active after a logout.
-   **SessionDeletedEvent**: A new `SessionDeletedEvent` is introduced. This event is posted when a session is deleted, which triggers the cache invalidation on other nodes.
-   **MongoDbSessionDAO Modification**: The `MongoDbSessionDAO` is updated to subscribe to the `SessionDeletedEvent` and uncache the corresponding session.
-   **UserSessionTerminationService**: Changes to the `UserSessionTerminationService` are made, potentially to ensure all sessions are terminated and not just the ones from the current node.
-   **UsersResource**: Modifications to the `UsersResource` involve proper session handling, especially when session timeouts are changed.

This vulnerability allows for potential unauthorized access to the Graylog API after user logout, due to inconsistent session state across nodes. The fix involves invalidating the session cache across the cluster upon logout.
