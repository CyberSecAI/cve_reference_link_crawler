- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing SSL certificate validation and disabling of HTTPS warnings in the HTTPie application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper certificate validation (CWE-295).
    - Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200) due to the possibility of MITM attacks.
    - Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319) if the connection is intercepted.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
    - Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
    - User unaware of insecure SSL implementations.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Interception of network traffic between the client and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to intercept network traffic, typically by being in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
