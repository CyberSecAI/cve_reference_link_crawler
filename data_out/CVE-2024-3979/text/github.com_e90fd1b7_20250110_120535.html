| vSomeip Version 3.4.10 Boost Version 1.71 Environment Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS Describe the bug During testing of vsomeip with AFL++, a concurrency bug was identified. This vulnerability may lead to crashes or inconsistent behavior when vsomeip is concurrently accessed. Reproduction Steps Compile the test program. `mkdir build` `cd build` `cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=afl-clang-fast -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=afl-clang-fast++ ..` `make`  Please refer to the specific CMakeLists.txt in the details.zip for details. For the program startup command, crash test cases, and test program, please refer to poc.txt in the details.zip.
