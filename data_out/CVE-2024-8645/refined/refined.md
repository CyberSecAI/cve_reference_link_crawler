Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The SPRT dissector in Wireshark incorrectly continues to parse RTP packets using the SPRT protocol even after the SPRT session has ended. This occurs when the same UDP port is reused for a different RTP stream with a different payload type and RTP version (specifically when switching back to G.711 after SPRT is finished).
*   The dissector does not properly check the RTP version or payload type after the SPRT session ends, leading to the SPRT dissector attempting to process packets that are not valid SPRT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Protocol Handling:** The SPRT dissector fails to recognize that the subsequent RTP packets on the same UDP port are no longer SPRT, causing it to treat them as if they were still SPRT packets.
*   **Memory Access Violation:** When the SPRT dissector tries to parse these invalid packets, it causes a memory access violation, leading to a crash.
*   **Lack of Proper RTP Stream Context:** The dissector does not properly manage the context of the RTP stream, specifically the RTP version and payload type. It relies on the UDP port number to determine the dissector instead of checking the RTP header details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed packets onto the network or convincing a user to open a malicious packet trace file. This results in denial of service as the application becomes unusable due to the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject specially crafted network packets with a specific RTP stream that uses the same UDP port used for SPRT, with the expectation that Wireshark will crash when it attempts to parse it as SPRT.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can create a malicious capture file with a combination of SPRT and G.711 packets, with the goal of crashing Wireshark upon opening it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto the network being monitored by Wireshark or create a malicious capture file that a victim will open.
*   The attacker needs to know that the target is using Wireshark with vulnerable versions.
* The attacker must be able to craft packets with the specified characteristics: SPRT (payload not 0, and version 0) followed by G.711 RTP packets (payload 0 version 2) on the same port.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability occurs due to the SPRT dissector's failure to validate the RTP version and payload type before processing the packets.
*   The issue is triggered when a UDP port previously used for SPRT is reused for a different RTP stream, specifically G.711.
* The provided gitlab issue includes a sample capture file, logs and build information of vulnerable versions.
