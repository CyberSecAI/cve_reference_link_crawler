Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the user management interface of WVP-GB28181-pro 2.0. Specifically, when changing a user's password, the `userId` parameter in the request is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to modify the password of other users, including the administrator account.

*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization checks when updating user passwords. The system relies on the user-supplied `userId` parameter without verifying if the current user has the authority to modify the password of the user identified by the provided `userId`.

*  **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An ordinary user can modify the password of the administrator account, gaining full access to the platform.
    *   **Data Exposure/Modification:** With administrator access, the attacker can access and modify sensitive information, platform resources, and configurations.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker must be able to log into the platform with a non-administrative user account.
    *   The attacker must then navigate to the user management interface and intercept the password change request.
    *   The attacker modifies the request by changing the `userId` parameter to "1" (or the administrator's ID), and by modifying the new password value.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs a valid non-administrator user account on the platform.
    *   The attacker needs basic web development skills to inspect and modify HTTP requests.
    *   The attacker must have access to the network where the application is hosted.

**Technical Details:**

The report indicates the following steps to reproduce the vulnerability:

1.  Log into the WVP-GB28181-pro 2.0 platform with a regular user account (credentials were shown to be `admin/123`).
2.  Navigate to the user management section.
3.  Intercept the password change request.
4.  Modify the `userId` parameter in the request to `1` (or the ID of the admin user).
5.  Change the password to a new value and send the request.
6.  Login using the admin account with the changed password.

The report also provided a link to a publicly accessible instance of the vulnerable application: `http://112.28.134.194:8088/#/login`.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content includes links to the repository and documentation of the wvp-GB28181-pro project. It also emphasizes that the vulnerability exists in version 2.0 and that the reported issue was a logical flaw.

**Summary:**

The content describes a critical IDOR vulnerability in the password reset functionality of the `wvp-GB28181-pro` application. A non-admin user can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges, gain full access to the system, and potentially compromise sensitive data. The attacker achieves this by manipulating the `userId` parameter in the password change request, enabling them to modify the passwords of other users, including the administrator.
