Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-21641:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `promoted builds` plugin versions 3.9 and earlier do not enforce POST request requirements for HTTP endpoints that trigger build promotion actions (regular, forced, and re-execute).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The lack of POST request validation on the promotion endpoints allows an attacker to craft malicious web pages or links that, when accessed by an authenticated user, will trigger build promotions without the user's explicit intent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can promote builds without the user's knowledge or consent. This could lead to a number of issues including deploying untested or malicious code and potentially disrupting the CI/CD pipeline.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker crafts a malicious webpage or link. When a logged-in user clicks the link or visits the webpage, the browser automatically sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint, causing the targeted action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in Jenkins user into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking on a malicious link.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the Jenkins server URL and the affected plugin endpoints.
- The attacker does not require special privileges on the Jenkins server. The targeted user should be authenticated and have the necessary permissions to promote builds.
