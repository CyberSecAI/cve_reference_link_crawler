Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A regression introduced in the 6.3 kernel due to the conversion to netfs.
- The issue arises when the maximum write size negotiated with the server or specified by the user during mount is not a multiple of 4096 (PAGE_SIZE).
- When the write size is not a multiple of 4096, the netfs code can incorrectly skip the end of the final page during large sequential writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Data corruption:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for data corruption during large sequential writes to the SMB share. Specifically, data at the end of pages could be skipped.
- **Incorrect write size handling:** The code did not correctly handle cases where the maximum write size was not a multiple of 4096, which is a requirement of the underlying netfs layer after the conversion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data corruption during write operations. This could lead to loss of data integrity, file corruption, application errors, and potentially system instability, depending on the nature of the written data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious SMB server:** A malicious server could negotiate a maximum write size that is not a multiple of 4096, triggering the bug on the client when the client performs a write.
- **Mount option manipulation:** An attacker with the ability to influence mount options could specify a `wsize` parameter that is not a multiple of 4096 to trigger the bug when writing to the SMB share.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to either control or have the ability to influence either:
  - The SMB server and its configuration for negotiating the maximum write size.
  - The mount options to the SMB client, specifically the 'wsize' parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix rounds down the negotiated or user-provided maximum write size to the nearest multiple of 4096 (PAGE_SIZE).
- If the rounded-down value is zero, the write size is reset to the minimum value of 4096 (PAGE_SIZE).
- A warning message is added if the user specifies a `wsize` that is not a multiple of 4096.
- The issue affects Linux kernel versions 6.3 and later, where the netfs conversion was introduced.
