## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ad Injection <= 1.2.0.19 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting & RCE

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize the body of the adverts injected into the pages, allowing a high privileged user (Admin+) to inject arbitrary HTML or javascript even with unfiltered\_html disallowed, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Further it is also possible to inject PHP code, leading to a Remote Code execution (RCE) vulnerability, even if the DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT and DISALLOW\_FILE\_MOD constants are both set.

### Proof of Concept

- On the left colum go to Settings > Ad Injection.
- In the section Adverts: Top ad (below post title - this is not a 'header' ad) use the following payload:
For RCE:
<?php system('id'); ?>
Alternatively for XSS:
<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
