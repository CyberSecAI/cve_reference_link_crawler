The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's BPF JIT compiler for the PowerPC 32-bit architecture. Specifically, it addresses a stack corruption issue arising from tail calls to BPF programs with different stack depths.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When a BPF program performs a tail call to another BPF program with a different stack depth, the stack was not correctly adjusted. The caller's stack was preserved, but the callee restored the stack based on its own frame size. This lead to the stack pointer being increased erroneously on each tail call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack corruption due to incorrect stack handling during tail calls, specifically with inconsistent stack frame sizes between caller and callee BPF programs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash (Oops) due to attempts to write beyond the stack boundary.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a tail call from a BPF program to another BPF program that has a different stack depth will cause the stack corruption. This can be triggered by loading and running specific crafted BPF programs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to load and execute BPF programs with tail calls, likely requiring root privileges.

**Technical details:**

- The original implementation preserved the callerâ€™s stack frame during tail calls and passed the tail call count via the stack, because the powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone in the stack. However, the called function would restore the stack based on its own frame size, leading to stack corruption when the stack frame sizes of the caller and callee differed.
- The fix uses register r4 to pass the tail call count. At entry of a function, the count is saved to the stack if required, resolving the stack corruption issue.
- The fix modifies `arch/powerpc/net/bpf_jit_comp32.c`, specifically:
    - The prologue is changed to initialize r4 with 0 for the tail call counter.
    - The tail call logic is modified to pass the tail call counter in r4, and to save this value to the stack at entry of the BPF program if needed.
    -  The epilogue of BPF programs was corrected to handle the stack frame adjustment correctly.
