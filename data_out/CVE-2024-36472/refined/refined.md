- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The portal helper in GNOME Shell loads untrusted web content without user input, allowing an attacker to force the portal helper to launch.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The portal helper loads arbitrary web content, enabling HTML/JavaScript execution.
    - The helper is vulnerable to WebKit zero-day exploits.
    - The attack can occur without user interaction, including when the computer is locked, unattended or potentially during fullscreen video playback, and in multiseat environments.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution, leading to actions like cryptocurrency mining or participation in DDoS attacks.
    - Exploitation of WebKit vulnerabilities to potentially gain code execution and possibly achieve sandbox escape, which can compromise the host system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Active network attacker can force the portal helper to launch.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and force the portal helper to launch.
    - The attacker doesn't need to trick the user into clicking anything, but needs to be in a network position.
