Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5901

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Image Grid widget of the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input for the `link_attributes` within the Image Grid widget and also fails to escape it when outputting to the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages using the vulnerable Image Grid widget. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - Modifying the content of the webpage.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the Image Grid widget renders the user-supplied `link_attributes`.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the attributes of the image links within the Image Grid widget. For example, the `link_attributes` array could include a key such as `onclick` or `onmouseover` with a malicious JavaScript payload as a value. This malicious code will then be executed when the link is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher are able to exploit the vulnerability because they can edit and add content to pages with the vulnerable widget.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `default.php` template file for the Image Grid widget, specifically where the `link_attributes` are output, and where these attributes are being configured in the `image-grid.php` file.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin up to and including 1.62.2.
- The issue is resolved in version 1.62.3.
