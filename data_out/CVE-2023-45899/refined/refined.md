- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the `SuperUserSetuserModuleFrontController:init()` function of the "superuser" module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the module failed to properly restrict access to the "connect as" feature, allowing an attacker to connect as any customer account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
    - CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Personal data leaks
    - Unauthorized access to customer accounts, potentially leading to access to registered payment methods if saved credit card information is enabled.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker only needs to craft a trivial HTTP request.
