This plugin is exceptional and very easy to use. I am a photographer and I have a lot of images on my site. I was able to update all my Alt tags very easily, and above all the artificial intelligence used recognizes and describes my images perfectly, even complicated ones. The huge time saving is well worth the investment, I recommend 200%. In addition, the support responds very quickly and is very efficient.

In theory this seemed like the perfect idea for our site so we tried it. Within a few hours, it was turning some of our pics into script only and destroying many of our pics permanently.
My advice if you want to try it is to put it on a staging platform first to see how it works for you. For us, it was a disaster. No refund was offered, which is disappointing for such an expensive plugin.
Our site was a new webpress one with a new theme running on 8.4 php.
No warning was on this plugin that it may have destructive effects to your site.

I have been a subscriber with Alttext.ai since August The developers of this service and plugin have been very focused and committed. The only 1-star review that is here would be correct back in August 2023, and I even shared with them my disappointment at the time with what felt like missed potential. They promised they would stay focused and it would be a great program, and they did not disappoint! Hands down – alttext.ai is pretty much a no-brainer for anyone with a website – especially with large visual images. The quality of the output and the automation it now has is incredible and doesn’t just save time – it saves the impossible if you have a site like ours were with thousands of images without a decent alt text and description.
I’d also argue we are seeing its effect almost instantly with our ranking, too.
Great job guys, really glad I supported the app and plugin early and stuck it through! Get this plugin!
