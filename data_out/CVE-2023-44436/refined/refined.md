- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the existence of an object prior to performing operations on it during the parsing of PDF files. This can lead to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file, which the target user needs to open using Kofax Power PDF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote. The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file. The target user needs to open the malicious PDF file for the exploit to occur.
