- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper parameter initialization in the BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a local low-privileged attacker to read the contents of non-SMM stack memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information stored in the non-SMM stack memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, meaning the attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local, low-privileged attacker is required. The attacker does not require any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
