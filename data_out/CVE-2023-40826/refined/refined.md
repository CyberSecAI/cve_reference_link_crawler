The content is related to CVE-2023-40826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `loadPluginFromPath` method in `pf4j` does not securely verify the `pluginPath` value when loading plugins. Specifically, when loading a plugin from a ZIP file, the method extracts the contents of the ZIP file without proper sanitization of the file paths contained within the archive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to craft a malicious ZIP archive containing files with paths like `../../../malicious.exe`, which, when extracted, can overwrite or create files outside of the intended plugin directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker can write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to:
    - Code execution by overwriting existing executables or libraries.
    - Data exfiltration by creating files in accessible locations.
    - Denial of service by overwriting critical system files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious ZIP archive: An attacker crafts a ZIP archive that contains files with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`) in their names.
- `loadPluginFromPath` method: The vulnerable `loadPluginFromPath` method in `pf4j` is called with the path to the malicious ZIP archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide the path to a malicious ZIP file to the `loadPluginFromPath` method. This could be achieved by:
    - Direct access to a parameter that is passed to the method if the application exposes it.
    - If the path comes from a database or file, then ability to alter or create such records or files.
    - Social Engineering to convince an administrator to upload the malicious file to the intended location.
