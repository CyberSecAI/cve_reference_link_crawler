Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1090

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `stopOptimizeAll` function of the ImageRecycle pdf & image compression WordPress plugin. This allows unauthorized users to modify image optimization settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a capability check within the `stopOptimizeAll` function. This means that the plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions (`manage_options`) to execute the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Settings Modification:** An attacker with subscriber-level access or above can modify the image optimization settings of the plugin.
- This could lead to a variety of impacts, potentially disrupting normal plugin functionality or affecting website performance, as stopping optimization processes could affect the optimized images.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user (subscriber level or higher).
- **Direct Request:** Attackers send a request to the `stopOptimizeAll` function without proper authorization checks. This is done through an AJAX request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site, with subscriber or higher privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious request.
- **Understanding of Plugin Functionality:** The attacker should know the plugin's API endpoint and the action name.
- **Knowledge of AJAX calls:** The attacker needs to be aware that the vulnerable action is called via AJAX.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions up to and including 3.1.13.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.1.14 by adding capability checks (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) to the vulnerable function.
- In the fix, the `check_ajax_referer` was added and combined with `current_user_can` which returns true if the current user has the specified capability. This function is used to check if the current user has the 'manage_options' capability, which is typically granted to administrators. If the user does not have this capability, the function returns an error.
- The fix also introduced a nonce verification `_ajax_wpio_nonce`, which prevents CSRF attacks.
