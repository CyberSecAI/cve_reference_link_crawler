[CVE-2024-21583  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21583) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-15  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/15.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/install/installer/pkg/components/public-api-server` to version main-gha.27122 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cookie Tossing due to a missing `__Host-` prefix on the `_gitpod_io_jwt2_` session cookie. This allows an adversary who controls a subdomain to set the value of the cookie on the Gitpod control plane, which can be assigned to an attacker’s own JWT so that specific actions taken by the victim (such as connecting a new Github organization) are actioned by the attackers session.
