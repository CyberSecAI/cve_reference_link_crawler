Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of validation of the number of IRQs (`nirq`) obtained from the Device Tree (`pdata->gpio_unbanked`) in the `davinci_gpio_probe()` function within the Linux kernel's DaVinci GPIO driver. A corrupted Device Tree could provide an arbitrary value for `pdata->gpio_unbanked`, leading to an out-of-bounds access when allocating memory for interrupt handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds access:**  The vulnerability lies in the possibility of accessing memory outside of the allocated `chips->irqs` array bounds. This is because the `nirq` value, which determines the size of the `chips->irqs` array, is not validated.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The driver fails to properly validate input from the Device Tree, specifically the number of interrupts that the driver will handle, leading to the possibility of using arbitrary values from a potentially corrupted Device Tree.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** An out-of-bounds write can lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, out-of-bounds memory access vulnerabilities can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Device Tree:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted, malformed Device Tree that specifies an excessively large number of IRQs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Modify the Device Tree:** An attacker needs the ability to modify or provide a custom Device Tree to trigger the vulnerability. This usually implies some level of control over the boot process.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is located in `drivers/gpio/gpio-davinci.c` in the `davinci_gpio_probe()` function. The original code calculates the number of IRQs as follows:
```c
else
    nirq = DIV_ROUND_UP(ngpio, 16);
```
where `ngpio` is the number of GPIOs. If a non-zero value for `pdata->gpio_unbanked` is provided in the Device Tree, then that value will be used to compute the `nirq`. This value is not validated and an incorrect value could cause an out-of-bounds access in a later memory allocation and the driver expects it to be within a certain range. The fix adds the following validation to prevent the out-of-bounds access:
```c
if (nirq > MAX_INT_PER_BANK) {
        dev_err(dev, "Too many IRQs!\n");
        return -EINVAL;
}
```
This code checks if the calculated number of interrupts exceeds the `MAX_INT_PER_BANK` limit and if so, returns an error, preventing the out-of-bounds access. `MAX_INT_PER_BANK` is defined as 64 in the same file.

**Additional Notes:**
The fix also includes a `Fixes` tag referencing a previous commit that introduced the non-contiguous IRQ numbering, which this vulnerability is related to. The vulnerability was found by the Linux Verification Center using the SVACE tool.
