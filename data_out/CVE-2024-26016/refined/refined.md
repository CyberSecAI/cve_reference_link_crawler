  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper authorization validation during the import of dashboards and charts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A low privilege authenticated user can import dashboards or charts that they do not have access to.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "After importing a dashboard or chart, a low privilege user can modify its metadata, gaining ownership of the object. However, access to the analytical data is still controlled by existing data access privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a low-privilege user who is authenticated to Apache Superset.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges on the Apache Superset platform."
