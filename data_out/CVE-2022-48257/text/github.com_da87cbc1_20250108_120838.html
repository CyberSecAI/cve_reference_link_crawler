### **[jshort](/jshort)** commented [Dec 16, 2022](#issue-1500646487)

| This is a feature request to allow an ini-config based and/or cxxopts way to change the location of the log files from /tmp to a directory of your choice:   * ideally the logfiles should go into a dedicated directory e.g. in   /var/log/et for the server side. * for the client side a set of logfiles can be kept in the home   directory, but old logs should be deleted after some time.   Alternatively client logs can be placed into /run/user//et-logs   or a similar location. * when using shared world-writable directories like /tmp then at least   `O_NOFOLLOW|O_EXCL|O_CREAT` should also be added to open() flags. If   open fails then it should be retried with alternative filenames until   it succeeds. * the file mode mask should be set in a way that the resulting files   only have 0600 permissions i.e. read and write permission for the   owner to avoid leaking information to other users on the system. |
