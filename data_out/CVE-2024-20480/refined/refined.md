- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of IPv4 DHCP packets within the DHCP Snooping feature of Cisco IOS XE Software on SD-Access fabric edge nodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the software processes specific IPv4 DHCP packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause high CPU utilization on the affected device, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device becomes unresponsive and requires a manual reload to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and involves sending specially crafted IPv4 DHCP packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending the malicious DHCP packets to a device configured as an SD-Access fabric edge node with DHCP snooping enabled.
