The provided content describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities in DrayTek vigor3900 router firmware version 1.5.1.6.

**Vulnerability 1 (Pre-authentication):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input sanitization in the `/www/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` file, specifically within the `sub_2C920` function. The `formpassword` field, after base64 decoding and a weak filtering process, is used in a shell command execution through the `sub_21F28` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection due to insufficient filtering of special characters in the `formpassword` field. The `filter_string2` function fails to block characters such as `&`, spaces, and `'`, which are essential for crafting shell commands.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the router. An attacker can execute shell commands on the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to know a valid phone number configured for phone authentication on the device. This is a pre-authentication vulnerability if the phone number is known, meaning the attacker doesn't need valid credentials to exploit it, only a valid phone number.

**Vulnerability 2 (Post-authentication - first place):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper input sanitization in the `/www/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` file within the `sub_11DC8` function. The `password` field from a multipart/form-data request is directly used in a shell command execution
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection due to the lack of proper filtering of the `password` field.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the router.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/certificaterequestupload` with a malicious `password` field within a multipart/form-data request
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires authentication to the web interface.

**Vulnerability 3 (Post-authentication - second place):**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input sanitization in the `/www/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` file within the `sub_11F38` function. The `keyPassphrase` field from a multipart/form-data request is directly used in a shell command execution
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection due to the lack of proper filtering of the `keyPassphrase` field.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the router.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/userkeyupload` with a malicious `keyPassphrase` field within a multipart/form-data request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires authentication to the web interface.
