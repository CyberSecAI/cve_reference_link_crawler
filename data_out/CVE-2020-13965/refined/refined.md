{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-13965",
    "description": "Roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, did not correctly process and sanitize requests. This would allow a remote attacker to perform a Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) attack leading to the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of 'text/xml' attachments. The application did not properly sanitize or filter the XML content, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including exfiltration of the victim's emails and deletion of emails, as mentioned in one of the provided resources.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted email with a malicious XML attachment. When the victim previews the attachment in Roundcube, the XSS vulnerability is triggered.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim. The email must contain a malicious XML attachment with a crafted script tag to trigger the XSS.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is related to how Roundcube handles and previews 'text/xml' attachments. Modern browsers' XML parsing capabilities are exploited to execute the malicious Javascript."
