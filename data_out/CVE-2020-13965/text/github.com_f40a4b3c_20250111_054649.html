[`9898599`](/roundcube/roundcubemail/commit/9898599d3ed504a604fd5bdc5fa0bea75129dadc)

This is a service and security update to the stable version 1.4 of Roundcube Webmail.

It contains fixes for recently reported security vulnerabilities as well a number

of general improvements from our issue tracker. See the full changelog below.

## Security fixes

* Fix XSS issue in template object 'username' ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Fix cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious XML attachment
* Fix a couple of XSS issues in Installer ([#7406](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7406))
* Better fix for `CVE-2020-12641`

The latter two vulnerabilities again are related to public access to the Roundcube installer

and are therefore classified minor.

This version is considered stable and we recommend to update all productive installations

of Roundcube with it. Please do backup your data before updating!
