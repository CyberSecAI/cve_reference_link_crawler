# Privilege escalation via ApiTokensEndpoint

High

GHSA-9jcq-jf57-c62c

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=22.1.0, <23.7.2

## Patched versions

23.7.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests.

There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on <https://sentry.io>. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens via `https://your-self-hosted-sentry-installation/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`.

### Patches

The issue was fixed in [#53850](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850) and is available in the release 23.7.2 of [sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2) and [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-39349

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)
