### Legal Boilerplate

Look, I get it. The entity doing business as "Sentry" was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015 as Functional Software, Inc. and is gonna need some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in this here PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate intact I confirm that Sentry can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my contributions, under Sentry's choice of terms.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This PR is forbidding users from passing in a bearer token to our `ApiTokensEndpoint` right? The previous `SessionAuthentication` used would just ignore passed tokens I think (feel free to correct me), so does this mean that we now strictly forbid tokens here, and, if a user has an active session *and* passes a token, we 403 as well?

Sorry, something went wrong.
