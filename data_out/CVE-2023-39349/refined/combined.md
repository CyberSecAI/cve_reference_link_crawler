# Privilege escalation via ApiTokensEndpoint

High

[oioki](/oioki)
published
GHSA-9jcq-jf57-c62c
Aug 7, 2023

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=22.1.0, <23.7.2

## Patched versions

23.7.2

## Description

### Impact

An attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests.

There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on <https://sentry.io>. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens via `https://your-self-hosted-sentry-installation/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`.

### Patches

The issue was fixed in [#53850](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850) and is available in the release 23.7.2 of [sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2) and [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-39349

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)

### Legal Boilerplate

Look, I get it. The entity doing business as "Sentry" was incorporated
in the State of Delaware in 2015 as Functional Software, Inc. and is
gonna need some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in
this here PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and
interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate
intact I confirm that Sentry can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my
contributions, under Sentry's choice of terms.

### @oioki **[oioki](/oioki)** commented [Jul 31, 2023](#issue-1829204089)

### Legal Boilerplate

Look, I get it. The entity doing business as "Sentry" was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015 as Functional Software, Inc. and is gonna need some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in this here PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate intact I confirm that Sentry can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my contributions, under Sentry's choice of terms.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This PR is forbidding users from passing in a bearer token to our `ApiTokensEndpoint` right? The previous `SessionAuthentication` used would just ignore passed tokens I think (feel free to correct me), so does this mean that we now strictly forbid tokens here, and, if a user has an active session *and* passes a token, we 403 as well?

Sorry, something went wrong.
