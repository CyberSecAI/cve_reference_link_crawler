Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-39349

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `/api/0/api-tokens/` endpoint.  Specifically, an API token with limited or no scopes could be used to retrieve a list of all API tokens associated with the user, including tokens with greater privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a low-privileged API token can obtain higher-privileged tokens.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The API endpoint for retrieving tokens did not properly enforce permission checks, leading to the exposure of all tokens belonging to a user, regardless of the requesting token's scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker, after gaining access to a low-privileged token, could:
- Obtain API tokens with broader scopes.
- Use these more privileged tokens to perform actions they were not initially authorized to execute.
- Potentially gain complete control of the affected user's account and its associated resources/data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the affected Sentry instance.
- Exploitation via the `/api/0/api-tokens/` endpoint

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a valid, albeit low-privileged, API token for the Sentry instance. This could be obtained via various means, including compromised accounts.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the `/api/0/api-tokens/` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a new authentication class `SessionNoAuthTokenAuthentication` to the `ApiTokensEndpoint`. This class disallows the use of API tokens, thus preventing the described information leak.
- The fix is included in Sentry version 23.7.2 and later. Self-hosted users are advised to rotate user auth tokens and upgrade their instances.
- There's no evidence this vulnerability was exploited on `sentry.io`, but self-hosted users were advised to rotate tokens.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
- The related CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- The vulnerability was reported by user LTiDi2000.
