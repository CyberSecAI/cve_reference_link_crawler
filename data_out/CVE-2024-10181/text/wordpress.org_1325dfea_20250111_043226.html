#### PRO Version

The Newsletters LITE version has nearly all of the features that the PRO version has but it has some limitations.

* One mailing list.
* 500 max subscribers.
* Send up to 1000 emails per month.
* Mail Type: local server and SMTP. No API integration with our [mail service providers](https://tribulant.com/docs/wordpress-mailing-list-plugin/10570/sending-apis/).
* The “Drag & drop newsletter & template builder” cannot be used.
* No new custom dynamic fields can be added but you can edit current ones.

These limits should be sufficient for a personal blogger or a small business.

To remove these limits, you can upgrade to the PRO version and submit your serial key inside the plugin.

Or, download, install, and activate the PRO version from our website under Downloads, and then add your serial key. This is the preferred method. After installing the PRO version, you can safely deactivate and delete the LITE version without losing your data.

In addition to the limits being removed, you will receive [priority support](https://tribulant.com/support/) from [Tribulant](https://tribulant.com).

Not happy with the harrassing notice every time I log in to WordPress to leave a review. Also, the output HTML is extremely junky. Other than that, the free version more or less meets functionality.

Had a problem with the plugin, got some strange errors on cloning newsletters with content areas and also on sending through Mailgun api. Opened ticket in Tribulant support and after a good week they had it fixed. Great service.

I’m rooting for this one to get better. When functional, it can be good. That said, its functionality has proved to be rather volatile at times. Regarding customer service, there’s room for improvement. I have received some help from them and it’s been appreciated when it came through. That said, the predictability of timely responses isn’t there. That can be frustrating when issues arise (and they often do).

Our email system has been through many different companies trying to get out of spam folders and into the inbox. all of them said they guaranteed results. but the only results were to be listed on spam lists because of shared IP address or entire IP blocks being listed and we just happen to be in a bad IP network.
once we started using Tribulant our numbers to the inbox almost quadrupled because we were using our own server and not a service. And after their support team showed us how our site was slow and how to fix it, along with the updates they have helped us with regarding our send rate issues, i couldn’t be happier with the software or their service.
we have even transferred from our old hosting service to tribulants hosting for a much faster and flexible system then our old expensive “daddy”.
as to the software itself… its very flexible and has many features that more expensive services do not have.
the ability to use your hosting server or an external smtp server for sending makes it useable if you already have a SMTP service you send through.
the bounce and unsubscribe features are automatic when setup correctly and make you fully compliant with the BIG 4 mail services (gmail, aol, hotmail, and yahoo) along with all the rest as far as removal of unhappy recipients.
The Newsletter Creator is simple to learn and use as well as fully customizable to make it look and feel like a part of your website…or be something completely new each mail you send.
the mailing lists being a separate list than the website user list was a major factor for us but its ability to link to a site user would be very useful in others cases.
stuff i haven’t even got to tinker with yet are the ability to customize the sign up and list management pages for the subscribers. or the subscription to multiple lists for different send rates (day/week/month) or products or whatever…
and the cost makes it a tool that can grow as you do and not kill your bank account just to try.
and the MANY more features i haven’t list here, are the reason im leaving this long review.
I hope this helps someone make a decision… because Tribulant helped us, Im sure they could help you.

This is the best free Newsletter plugin available, and it has so many great features and benefits – way too many to mention here but editable themes, spam score display, ability to insert WooCommerce products into newsletters and filterable lists are just a few….
Also worth mentioning is that you can set it up to send out Newsletters automatically on schedules,(your latest posts etc) or manually any time you want. I’m surprised it doesn’t have more downloads/users.
It does take a while to get your head around all of the configurations, and it could greatly benefit from a better user interface or (even better) a wizard to set it all up quickly, but it’s worth sticking with and hopefully that will come in future…. 🙂 The pro version and pro themes seem very fair in price too, so I hope to upgrade to pro in the near future…
Thanks again for this great plugin, generosity and all your hard work. Regards, Karen
