## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP MultiTasking <= 0.1.12 - Reflected XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

As a contributor, add the following to a post or page:
`[markid id='2" style="background-color: red; width: 500px; height: 500px; content: linear-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5);" onmouseover="alert(1)"']2daddasdas[/markid]`
Move your mouse over the gradient and see the XSS
