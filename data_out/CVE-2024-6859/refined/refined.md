The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6859.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embedded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via shortcode attributes.
- Lack of input sanitization and output encoding of shortcode attributes

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post.
- This code can be executed in the context of a user's browser when the page is viewed.
- This can lead to actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing pages
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with at least a contributor role can create a post or page that contains a malicious shortcode.
- The shortcode attribute's value is reflected back into the page without sanitization.
- When a user visits the page, the malicious script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least the Contributor role in WordPress, which allows them to create posts and pages.
