{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing initialization of variables before being used as arguments to other functions. This leads to the usage of uninitialized values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Usage of uninitialized variables"
    ],
    "impact": "The use of uninitialized variables could lead to unpredictable behavior, potential crashes, or information disclosure, depending on how the uninitialized values are used by subsequent functions. The impact is considered low severity.",
     "attack_vectors": "The attack requires a crafted USB device or smart card that would present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs. This indicates the attacker needs to control the smart card or USB device.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the USB device or smart card, and is able to send specific crafted responses to the system."
