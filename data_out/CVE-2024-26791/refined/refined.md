{
  "CVE-2024-26791": {
    "description": "There's a syzbot report that device name buffers passed to device replace are not properly checked for string termination which could lead to a read out of bounds in getname_kernel().",
    "root_cause": "Device name buffers passed to the device replace functionality are not properly checked for string termination.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A read out of bounds in `getname_kernel()` can occur.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during a device replace operation by supplying a device name that is not properly null-terminated. This is done through an ioctl.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to call the `btrfs_dev_replace_by_ioctl` ioctl function, which usually requires elevated privileges."
