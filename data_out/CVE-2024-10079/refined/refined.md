- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The 'ajax_import_content' function in the WP Easy Post Types plugin deserializes the 'text' parameter without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** PHP Object Injection vulnerability due to the deserialization of untrusted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a PHP object. If a POP chain exists in another plugin or theme, this could lead to arbitrary file deletion, sensitive data retrieval, or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'ajax_import_content' function by sending a malicious serialized PHP object via the 'text' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be an authenticated user with subscriber-level permissions or higher.
