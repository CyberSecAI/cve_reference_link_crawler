Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the presence of an unprotected `SysInfo.htm` webpage on the Linksys E5350 router's web server. This page exposes sensitive information by calling a function `show_sysinfo` that extracts confidential device details, and it does so without requiring any form of authentication or session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users via the `SysInfo.htm` page. This includes:
    *   Plaintext WPA2 passwords
    *   MAC addresses
    *   SSIDs
    *   Serial numbers
    *   Firmware versions
    *   WPS Pin number
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `SysInfo.htm` page does not require any authentication, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
*   **Remote Exploitability:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the internet if remote management is enabled on the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the router's network by obtaining the plaintext WPA2 passwords.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If a user only has access to one network (e.g., 2.4Ghz), they may gain access to other networks (e.g., 5GHz) via the exposed passwords.
*   **Device Tracking:** Leaked MAC addresses can be used to track users of these routers and pinpoint their physical location using WiFi mapping services.
*   **Administrator Access:**  The exposed information can be used to attempt to gain access to the administrator interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the `SysInfo.htm` page via a web browser without needing to log in.
*   **Remote Access (Internet):** If remote management is enabled, the vulnerability can be exploited over the internet.
*   **Network Scanning:**  Attackers can use tools like Shodan to scan for vulnerable devices and identify them by unique strings in their HTTP responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router. This could be:
    *   **LAN Access:** On the local network the router is connected to.
    *   **WAN Access:** If remote management is enabled, the attacker can access the router from the internet.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs only basic knowledge of HTTP requests to access the vulnerable URL (`/SysInfo.htm`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post notes that the vulnerability exists in firmware versions 1.0.00.037 and lower.
*   The blog post also mentions a separate vulnerability regarding a hardcoded telnet password which is not part of the CVE description and is not related.
*   The vendor did not respond to the vulnerability report.
*   The post notes that the device has shared code with other devices so they may also be vulnerable.
