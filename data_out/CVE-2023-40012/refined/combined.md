### @woodruffw **[woodruffw](/woodruffw)** commented [May 15, 2023](#issue-1710829752)

We now use OpenSSL 3.0 or higher.

This also (partially) fixes a gap in our Authenticode compliance: we now reject signer certificates that lack the `codeSigning` EKU. This is a superset of Authenticode's specified behavior, as we lack the context (a full chain) needed to accept some certificates that don't have the `codeSigning` EKU. In practice, this shouldn't be a concern: most Authenticode CAs should be issuing EE certs with this EKU.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# EKU validation bypass in uthenticode

Moderate

[woodruffw](/woodruffw)
published
GHSA-gm2f-j4rj-6xqj
Aug 9, 2023

## Package

uthenticode
(C++)

## Affected versions

<2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.0

## Description

### Impact

Versions of uthenticode prior to the 2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result, a malicious user could produce a "signed" PE file that uthenticode would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate).

By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight.

### Patches

The 2.x release series includes EKU checks.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds to this vulnerability. Users should upgrade to the 2.x series of uthenticode.

### References

Forthcoming.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
