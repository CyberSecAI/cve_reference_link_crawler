### @woodruffw **[woodruffw](/woodruffw)** commented [May 15, 2023](#issue-1710829752)

We now use OpenSSL 3.0 or higher.

This also (partially) fixes a gap in our Authenticode compliance: we now reject signer certificates that lack the `codeSigning` EKU. This is a superset of Authenticode's specified behavior, as we lack the context (a full chain) needed to accept some certificates that don't have the `codeSigning` EKU. In practice, this shouldn't be a concern: most Authenticode CAs should be issuing EE certs with this EKU.

Sorry, something went wrong.
