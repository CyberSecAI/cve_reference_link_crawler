- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Super Newsletter" module for PrestaShop incorrectly uses the `_COOKIE_KEY_` as a secret within URLs, making it accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The module exposes the PrestaShop `_COOKIE_KEY_` which is used as a secret and to protect sensitive scripts, including those that export customer data. This is a classic CWE-200 (Information Exposure) vulnerability.
  - **Insecure Token Generation/Verification:** The module relies on the `_COOKIE_KEY_` directly instead of using a specific, secure token generation and verification mechanism, which exposes the secret to external users through URLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker (guest) can gain access to numerous admin scripts through the exposed secret within the URLs.
  - **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit this access to potentially export customer databases.
  - **GDPR Violation:** Unauthorized access to customer data leads to a GDPR violation.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
  - **URLs:** The secret is exposed via GET parameters in URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - **None:** No special privileges or user interaction are required; any guest user can exploit this vulnerability.
