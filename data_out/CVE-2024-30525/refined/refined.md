- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact is not detailed, but it is stated to have a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not explicitly detailed, but it involves a function that is accessible without proper authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker is required, implying that the vulnerability can be exploited by a user without any existing privileges or login.
