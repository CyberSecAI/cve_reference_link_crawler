{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in the file descriptor table.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability. The `put_unused_fd()` function was not releasing the file descriptor when a usercopy failed, resulting in a dangling 'file' object.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Userland can refer to a dangling 'file' object through a still valid file descriptor, leading to use-after-free exploitation scenarios.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user can trigger a failed usercopy of the fence_rep object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vmwgfx driver and trigger a usercopy failure while exporting a fence to a file descriptor."
