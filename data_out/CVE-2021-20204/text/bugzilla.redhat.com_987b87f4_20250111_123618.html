| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1956348#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-05-03 14:09:43 UTC  ``` A heap memory corruption problem (use after free) can be triggered in libgetdata v0.10.0 when processing maliciously crafted dirfile databases. This degrades the confidentiality, integrity and availability of third-party software that uses libgetdata as a library. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation depending on input/skills of attacker.
