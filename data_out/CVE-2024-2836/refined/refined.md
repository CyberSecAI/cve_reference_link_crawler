Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Super Socializer plugin not properly sanitizing and escaping certain settings. Specifically, the "Facebook URL" field within a widget is vulnerable to storing malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code injected into the plugin's settings is stored and later executed when the settings are rendered in a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Data Theft:** Extracting sensitive data displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or initiating downloads of malware.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the website.
    *   **Privilege Escalation**: In some cases, can be used to escalate user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Settings:** The attack vector involves manipulating the "FaceBook URL" field when creating or editing a widget within the Super Socializer plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an "Editor" or an administrator, to access the widget creation/editing functionality.
*   **No filtering:** The attacker must be able to insert unfiltered HTML, as opposed to simple text.

**Technical Details:**
* The provided proof of concept is `40"asdasd=''<script>alert(10)</script>;"`
*   The vulnerability is present in Super Socializer plugin versions prior to 7.13.64.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation) and an OWASP A7 (Cross-Site Scripting).
*   The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium), with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dmitrii Ignatyev and publicly disclosed on 2024-03-25.
