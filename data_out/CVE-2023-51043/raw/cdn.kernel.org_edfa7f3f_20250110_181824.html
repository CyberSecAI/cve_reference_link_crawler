    net/ncsi: change from ndo_set_mac_address to dev_set_mac_address
    
    commit 790071347a0a1a89e618eedcd51c687ea783aeb3 upstream.
    
    Change ndo_set_mac_address to dev_set_mac_address because
    dev_set_mac_address provides a way to notify network layer about MAC
    change. In other case, services may not aware about MAC change and keep
    using old one which set from network adapter driver.
    
    As example, DHCP client from systemd do not update MAC address without
    notification from net subsystem which leads to the problem with acquiring
    the right address from DHCP server.

    drm/atomic: Fix potential use-after-free in nonblocking commits
    
    commit 4e076c73e4f6e90816b30fcd4a0d7ab365087255 upstream.
    
    This requires a bit of background.  Properly done a modeset driver's
    unload/remove sequence should be
    
            drm_dev_unplug();
            drm_atomic_helper_shutdown();
            drm_dev_put();
    
    The trouble is that the drm_dev_unplugged() checks are by design racy,
    they do not synchronize against all outstanding ioctl.  This is because
    those ioctl could block forever (both for modeset and for driver
    specific ioctls), leading to deadlocks in hotunplug.  Instead the code
    sections that touch the hardware need to be annotated with
    drm_dev_enter/exit, to avoid accessing hardware resources after the
    unload/remove has finished.
    
    To avoid use-after-free issues all the involved userspace visible
    objects are supposed to hold a reference on the underlying drm_device,
    like drm_file does.
    
    The issue now is that we missed one, the atomic modeset ioctl can be run
    in a nonblocking fashion, and in that case it cannot rely on the implied
    drm_device reference provided by the ioctl calling context.  This can
    result in a use-after-free if an nonblocking atomic commit is carefully
    raced against a driver unload.
    
    Fix this by unconditionally grabbing a drm_device reference for any
    drm_atomic_state structures.  Strictly speaking this isn't required for
    blocking commits and TEST_ONLY calls, but it's the simpler approach.
    
    Thanks to shanzhulig for the initial idea of grabbing an unconditional
    reference, I just added comments, a condensed commit message and fixed a
    minor potential issue in where exactly we drop the final reference.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix mem access after free
    
    commit b843adde8d490934d042fbe9e3e46697cb3a64d2 upstream.
    
    System crash, where driver is accessing scsi layer's
    memory (scsi_cmnd->device->host) to search for a well known internal
    pointer (vha). The scsi_cmnd was released back to upper layer which
    could be freed, but the driver is still accessing it.

    Remove access of freed memory. Currently the driver was checking to see if
    scsi_done was called by seeing if the sp->type has changed. Instead,
    check to see if the command has left the  oustanding_cmds[] array as
    sign of scsi_done was called.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Wait for io return on terminate rport
    
    commit fc0cba0c7be8261a1625098bd1d695077ec621c9 upstream.
    
    System crash due to use after free.
    Current code allows terminate_rport_io to exit before making
    sure all IOs has returned. For FCP-2 device, IO's can hang
    on in HW because driver has not tear down the session in FW at
    first sign of cable pull. When dev_loss_tmo timer pops,
    terminate_rport_io is called and upper layer is about to
    free various resources. Terminate_rport_io trigger qla to do
    the final cleanup, but the cleanup might not be fast enough where it
    leave qla still holding on to the same resource.
    
    Wait for IO's to return to upper layer before resources are freed.

    tracing/user_events: Fix struct arg size match check
    
    commit d0a3022f30629a208e5944022caeca3568add9e7 upstream.
    
    When users register an event the name of the event and it's argument are
    checked to ensure they match if the event already exists. Normally all
    arguments are in the form of "type name", except for when the type
    starts with "struct ". In those cases, the size of the struct is passed
    in addition to the name, IE: "struct my_struct a 20" for an argument
    that is of type "struct my_struct" with a field name of "a" and has the
    size of 20 bytes.
    
    The current code does not honor the above case properly when comparing
    a match. This causes the event register to fail even when the same
    string was used for events that contain a struct argument within them.
    The example above "struct my_struct a 20" generates a match string of
    "struct my_struct a" omitting the size field.
    
    Add the struct size of the existing field when generating a comparison
    string for a struct field to ensure proper match checking.

    tracing/probes: Fix to record 0-length data_loc in fetch_store_string*() if fails
    
    commit 797311bce5c2ac90b8d65e357603cfd410d36ebb upstream.
    
    Fix to record 0-length data to data_loc in fetch_store_string*() if it fails
    to get the string data.
    Currently those expect that the data_loc is updated by store_trace_args() if
    it returns the error code. However, that does not work correctly if the
    argument is an array of strings. In that case, store_trace_args() only clears
    the first entry of the array (which may have no error) and leaves other
    entries. So it should be cleared by fetch_store_string*() itself.
    Also, 'dyndata' and 'maxlen' in store_trace_args() should be updated
    only if it is used (ret > 0 and argument is a dynamic data.)

    commit 4ed8f337dee32df71435689c19d22e4ee846e15a upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 2e9906f84fc7c99388bb7123ade167250d50f1c0.
    
    It was turned out that commit 2e9906f84fc7 ("tracing: Add "(fault)"
    name injection to kernel probes") did not work correctly and probe
    events still show just '(fault)' (instead of '"(fault)"'). Also,
    current '(fault)' is more explicit that it faulted.
    
    This also moves FAULT_STRING macro to trace.h so that synthetic
    event can keep using it, and uses it in trace_probe.c too.

    smb: client: Fix -Wstringop-overflow issues
    
    commit f1f047bd7ce0d73788e04ac02268060a565f7ecb upstream.
    
    pSMB->hdr.Protocol is an array of size 4 bytes, hence when the compiler
    analyzes this line of code
    
            parm_data = ((char *) &pSMB->hdr.Protocol) + offset;
    
    it legitimately complains about the fact that offset points outside the
    bounds of the array. Notice that the compiler gives priority to the object
    as an array, rather than merely the address of one more byte in a structure
    to wich offset should be added (which seems to be the actual intention of
    the original implementation).
    
    Fix this by explicitly instructing the compiler to treat the code as a
    sequence of bytes in struct smb_com_transaction2_spi_req, and not as an
    array accessed through pointer notation.
    
    Notice that ((char *)pSMB) + sizeof(pSMB->hdr.smb_buf_length) points to
    the same address as ((char *) &pSMB->hdr.Protocol), therefore this results
    in no differences in binary output.

    selftests: mptcp: pm_nl_ctl: fix 32-bit support
    
    commit 61d9658050260dbcbf9055479b7ac5bbbe1e8831 upstream.
    
    When using pm_nl_ctl to validate userspace path-manager's behaviours, it
    was failing on 32-bit architectures ~half of the time.
    
    pm_nl_ctl was not reporting any error but the command was not doing what
    it was expected to do. As a result, the expected linked event was not
    triggered after and the test failed.
    
    This is due to the fact the token given in argument to the application
    was parsed as an integer with atoi(): in a 32-bit arch, if the number
    was bigger than INT_MAX, 2147483647 was used instead.
    
    This can simply be fixed by using strtoul() instead of atoi().
    
    The errors have been seen "by chance" when manually looking at the
    results from LKFT.

    selftests: mptcp: depend on SYN_COOKIES
    
    commit 6c8880fcaa5c45355179b759c1d11737775e31fc upstream.
    
    MPTCP selftests are using TCP SYN Cookies for quite a while now, since
    v5.9.
    
    Some CIs don't have this config option enabled and this is causing
    issues in the tests:
    
      # ns1 MPTCP -> ns1 (10.0.1.1:10000      ) MPTCP     (duration   167ms) sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies: No such file or directory
      # [ OK ]./mptcp_connect.sh: line 554: [: -eq: unary operator expected
    
    There is no impact in the results but the test is not doing what it is
    supposed to do.

    In case of "external" errors when preparing the environment for the
    TProxy tests, the subtests were marked as skipped.
    
    This is fine but it means these errors are ignored. On MPTCP Public CI,
    we do want to catch such issues and mark the selftest as failed if there
    are such issues. We can then use mptcp_lib_fail_if_expected_feature()
    helper that has been recently added to fail if needed.

    commit 3fffa15bfef48b0ad6424779c03e68ae8ace5acb upstream.
    
    While tacking care of the mptcp-level listener I unintentionally
    moved the subflow level unhash after the subflow listener backlog
    cleanup.
    
    That could cause some nasty race and makes the code harder to read.
    
    Address the issue restoring the proper order of operations.

    mptcp: do not rely on implicit state check in mptcp_listen()
    
    commit 0226436acf2495cde4b93e7400e5a87305c26054 upstream.
    
    Since the blamed commit, closing the first subflow resets the first
    subflow socket state to SS_UNCONNECTED.
    
    The current mptcp listen implementation relies only on such
    state to prevent touching not-fully-disconnected sockets.
    
    Incoming mptcp fastclose (or paired endpoint removal) unconditionally
    closes the first subflow.
    
    All the above allows an incoming fastclose followed by a listen() call
    to successfully race with a blocking recvmsg(), potentially causing the
    latter to hit a divide by zero bug in cleanup_rbuf/__tcp_select_window().
    
    Address the issue explicitly checking the msk socket state in
    mptcp_listen(). An alternative solution would be moving the first
    subflow socket state update into mptcp_disconnect(), but in the long
    term the first subflow socket should be removed: better avoid relaying
    on it for internal consistency check.

    tracing: Fix null pointer dereference in tracing_err_log_open()
    
    commit 02b0095e2fbbc060560c1065f86a211d91e27b26 upstream.
    
    Fix an issue in function 'tracing_err_log_open'.
    The function doesn't call 'seq_open' if the file is opened only with
    write permissions, which results in 'file->private_data' being left as null.
    If we then use 'lseek' on that opened file, 'seq_lseek' dereferences
    'file->private_data' in 'mutex_lock(&m->lock)', resulting in a kernel panic.
    Writing to this node requires root privileges, therefore this bug
    has very little security impact.
    
    Tracefs node: /sys/kernel/tracing/error_log

    fprobe: Ensure running fprobe_exit_handler() finished before calling rethook_free()
    
    commit 195b9cb5b288fec1c871ef89f78cc9a7461aad3a upstream.
    
    Ensure running fprobe_exit_handler() has finished before
    calling rethook_free() in the unregister_fprobe() so that caller can free
    the fprobe right after unregister_fprobe().
    
    unregister_fprobe() ensured that all running fprobe_entry/exit_handler()
    have finished by calling unregister_ftrace_function() which synchronizes
    RCU. But commit 5f81018753df ("fprobe: Release rethook after the ftrace_ops
    is unregistered") changed to call rethook_free() after
    unregister_ftrace_function(). So call rethook_stop() to make rethook
    disabled before unregister_ftrace_function() and ensure it again.
    
    Here is the possible code flow that can call the exit handler after
    unregister_fprobe().
    
    ------
     CPU1                              CPU2
     call unregister_fprobe(fp)
     ...
                                       __fprobe_handler()
                                       rethook_hook() on probed function
     unregister_ftrace_function()
                                       return from probed function
                                       rethook hooks
                                       find rh->handler == fprobe_exit_handler
                                       call fprobe_exit_handler()
     rethook_free():
       set rh->handler = NULL;
     return from unreigster_fprobe;
                                       call fp->exit_handler() <- (*)
    ------
    
    (*) At this point, the exit handler is called after returning from
    unregister_fprobe().
    
    This fixes it as following;
    ------
     CPU1                              CPU2
     call unregister_fprobe()
     ...
     rethook_stop():
       set rh->handler = NULL;
                                       __fprobe_handler()
                                       rethook_hook() on probed function
     unregister_ftrace_function()
                                       return from probed function
                                       rethook hooks
                                       find rh->handler == NULL
                                       return from rethook
     rethook_free()
     return from unreigster_fprobe;

    accel/ivpu: Clear specific interrupt status bits on C0
    
    commit 7f34e01f77f811ecb2ef83e60301b38cf89af466 upstream.
    
    MTL C0 stepping fixed issue related to butrress interrupt status clearing,
    to clear an interrupt status it is required to write 1 to specific
    status bit field. This allows to execute read, modify and write routine.
    
    Writing 0 will not clear the interrupt and will cause interrupt storm.

    state->period/duty are of type u64, and if their value is greater than
    UINT_MAX, then the cast to uint will cause problems. Fix this by
    changing the type of the respective local variables to u64.

    commit 6b9352f3f8a1a35faf0efc1ad1807ee303467796 upstream.
    
    I don't see a reason why we should treat the case lo < hi differently
    and return 0 as period and duty_cycle. The current logic was added with
    c375bcbaabdb ("pwm: meson: Read the full hardware state in
    meson_pwm_get_state()"), Martin as original author doesn't remember why
    it was implemented this way back then.
    So let's handle it as normal use case and also remove the optimization
    for lo == 0. I think the improved readability is worth it.

    commit 3a8395b565b5b4f019b3dc182be4c4541eb35ac8 upstream.
    
    Commit 8d36694245f2 ("PM: QoS: Add check to make sure CPU freq is
    non-negative") makes sure CPU freq is non-negative to avoid negative
    value converting to unsigned data type. However, when the value is
    PM_QOS_DEFAULT_VALUE, pm_qos_update_target specifically uses
    c->default_value which is set to FREQ_QOS_MIN/MAX_DEFAULT_VALUE when
    cpufreq_policy_alloc is executed, for this case handling.
    
    Adding check for PM_QOS_DEFAULT_VALUE to let default setting work will
    fix this problem.

    perf/x86: Fix lockdep warning in for_each_sibling_event() on SPR
    
    commit 27c68c216ee1f1b086e789a64486e6511e380b8a upstream.
    
    On SPR, the load latency event needs an auxiliary event in the same
    group to work properly.  There's a check in intel_pmu_hw_config()
    for this to iterate sibling events and find a mem-loads-aux event.
    
    The for_each_sibling_event() has a lockdep assert to make sure if it
    disabled hardirq or hold leader->ctx->mutex.  This works well if the
    given event has a separate leader event since perf_try_init_event()
    grabs the leader->ctx->mutex to protect the sibling list.  But it can
    cause a problem when the event itself is a leader since the event is
    not initialized yet and there's no ctx for the event.
    
    Actually I got a lockdep warning when I run the below command on SPR,
    but I guess it could be a NULL pointer dereference.
    
      $ perf record -d -e cpu/mem-loads/uP true
    
    The code path to the warning is:
    
      sys_perf_event_open()
        perf_event_alloc()
          perf_init_event()
            perf_try_init_event()
              x86_pmu_event_init()
                hsw_hw_config()
                  intel_pmu_hw_config()
                    for_each_sibling_event()
                      lockdep_assert_event_ctx()
    
    We don't need for_each_sibling_event() when it's a standalone event.
    Let's return the error code directly.

    split_if_spec expects a NULL-pointer as an end marker for the argument

    incorrectly formatted interface specification string may cause a crash
    because of the random memory access. Fix that by adding NULL terminator

    drm/amd/pm: conditionally disable pcie lane/speed switching for SMU13
    
    commit 31c7a3b378a136adc63296a2ff17645896fcf303 upstream.
    
    Intel platforms such as Sapphire Rapids and Raptor Lake don't support
    dynamic pcie lane or speed switching.
    
    This limitation seems to carry over from one generation to another.
    To be safer, disable dynamic pcie lane width and speed switching when
    running on an Intel platform.

    ftrace: Fix possible warning on checking all pages used in ftrace_process_locs()
    
    commit 26efd79c4624294e553aeaa3439c646729bad084 upstream.
    
    As comments in ftrace_process_locs(), there may be NULL pointers in
    mcount_loc section:
     > Some architecture linkers will pad between
     > the different mcount_loc sections of different
     > object files to satisfy alignments.
     > Skip any NULL pointers.
    
    After commit 20e5227e9f55 ("ftrace: allow NULL pointers in mcount_loc"),
    NULL pointers will be accounted when allocating ftrace pages but skipped
    before adding into ftrace pages, this may result in some pages not being
    used. Then after commit 706c81f87f84 ("ftrace: Remove extra helper
    functions"), warning may occur at:
      WARN_ON(pg->next);
    
    To fix it, only warn for case that no pointers skipped but pages not used
    up, then free those unused pages after releasing ftrace_lock.

    Through the vmcore, I found it's because in tracing_read_pipe(),
    ring_buffer_empty_cpu() found some buffer is not empty but then it
    cannot read anything due to "rb_num_of_entries() == 0" always true,
    Then it infinitely loop the procedure due to user buffer not been
    filled, see following code path:
    
      tracing_read_pipe() {
        ... ...
        waitagain:
          tracing_wait_pipe() // 1. find non-empty buffer here
          trace_find_next_entry_inc()  // 2. loop here try to find an entry
            __find_next_entry()
              ring_buffer_empty_cpu();  // 3. find non-empty buffer
              peek_next_entry()  // 4. but peek always return NULL
                ring_buffer_peek()
                  rb_buffer_peek()
                    rb_get_reader_page()
                      // 5. because rb_num_of_entries() == 0 always true here
                      //    then return NULL
          // 6. user buffer not been filled so goto 'waitgain'
          //    and eventually leads to an deadloop in kernel!!!
      }
    
    By some analyzing, I found that when resetting ringbuffer, the 'entries'
    of its pages are not all cleared (see rb_reset_cpu()). Then when reducing
    the ringbuffer, and if some reduced pages exist dirty 'entries' data, they
    will be added into 'cpu_buffer->overrun' (see rb_remove_pages()), which
    cause wrong 'overrun' count and eventually cause the deadloop issue.
    
    To fix it, we need to clear every pages in rb_reset_cpu().

    Apparently, the reset delays are getting so large they can trigger a
    UBSAN panic.
    
    Looking at the code, the current timeout is capped at 5000us.  Using a
    base value of 100us, the current code will overflow after (1<<29).  Even
    at values before 32, this function wraps around, perhaps
    unintentionally.
    
    Cap the value of the exponent used for this backoff at (1<<16) which is
    larger than currently necessary, but large enough to support bigger
    values in the future.

    regmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers
    
    commit 963b54df82b6d6206d7def273390bf3f7af558e1 upstream.
    
    When allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in
    regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix
    with num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.
    
    This is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for
    each row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to
    allocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for
    each row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row
    (i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this
    allocation num_config_regs number of times.
    
    This scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs
    is greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating
    condition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register
    configuration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.
    
    Amit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device
    due to memory corruption (see "Closes" tag for Amit's report). The KASAN

    perf: RISC-V: Remove PERF_HES_STOPPED flag checking in riscv_pmu_start()
    
    commit 66843b14fb71825fdd73ab12f6594f2243b402be upstream.
    
    Since commit 096b52fd2bb4 ("perf: RISC-V: throttle perf events") the
    perf_sample_event_took() function was added to report time spent in
    overflow interrupts. If the interrupt takes too long, the perf framework
    will lower the sysctl_perf_event_sample_rate and max_samples_per_tick.
    When hwc->interrupts is larger than max_samples_per_tick, the
    hwc->interrupts will be set to MAX_INTERRUPTS, and events will be
    throttled within the __perf_event_account_interrupt() function.
    
    However, the RISC-V PMU driver doesn't call riscv_pmu_stop() to update the
    PERF_HES_STOPPED flag after perf_event_overflow() in pmu_sbi_ovf_handler()
    function to avoid throttling. When the perf framework unthrottled the event
    in the timer interrupt handler, it triggers riscv_pmu_start() function
    and causes a WARN_ON_ONCE() warning, as shown below:

    After referring other PMU drivers like Arm, Loongarch, Csky, and Mips,
    they don't call *_pmu_stop() to update with PERF_HES_STOPPED flag
    after perf_event_overflow() function nor do they add PERF_HES_STOPPED
    flag checking in *_pmu_start() which don't cause this warning.
    
    Thus, it's recommended to remove this unnecessary check in
    riscv_pmu_start() function to prevent this warning.

    samples: ftrace: Save required argument registers in sample trampolines
    
    commit 8564c315876ab86fcaf8e7f558d6a84cb2ce5590 upstream.
    
    The ftrace-direct-too sample traces the handle_mm_fault function whose
    signature changed since the introduction of the sample. Since:
    commit bce617edecad ("mm: do page fault accounting in handle_mm_fault")
    handle_mm_fault now has 4 arguments. Therefore, the sample trampoline
    should save 4 argument registers.
    
    s390 saves all argument registers already so it does not need a change
    but x86_64 needs an extra push and pop.
    
    This also evolves the signature of the tracing function to make it
    mirror the signature of the traced function.

    nvme: don't reject probe due to duplicate IDs for single-ported PCIe devices
    
    commit ac522fc6c3165fd0daa2f8da7e07d5f800586daa upstream.
    
    While duplicate IDs are still very harmful, including the potential to easily
    see changing devices in /dev/disk/by-id, it turn out they are extremely
    common for cheap end user NVMe devices.
    
    Relax our check for them for so that it doesn't reject the probe on
    single-ported PCIe devices, but prints a big warning instead.  In doubt
    we'd still like to see quirk entries to disable the potential for
    changing supposed stable device identifier links, but this will at least
    allow users how have two (or more) of these devices to use them without
    having to manually add a new PCI ID entry with the quirk through sysfs or
    by patching the kernel.

    tracing/histograms: Add histograms to hist_vars if they have referenced variables
    
    commit 6018b585e8c6fa7d85d4b38d9ce49a5b67be7078 upstream.
    
    Hist triggers can have referenced variables without having direct
    variables fields. This can be the case if referenced variables are added
    for trigger actions. In this case the newly added references will not
    have field variables. Not taking such referenced variables into
    consideration can result in a bug where it would be possible to remove
    hist trigger with variables being refenced. This will result in a bug
    that is easily reproducable like so
    
    $ cd /sys/kernel/tracing
    $ echo 'synthetic_sys_enter char[] comm; long id' >> synthetic_events
    $ echo 'hist:keys=common_pid.execname,id.syscall:vals=hitcount:comm=common_pid.execname' >> events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger

    We hit the bug because when second hist trigger has was created
    has_hist_vars() returned false because hist trigger did not have
    variables. As a result of that save_hist_vars() was not called to add
    the trigger to trace_array->hist_vars. Later on when we attempted to
    remove the first histogram find_any_var_ref() failed to detect it is
    being used because it did not find the second trigger in hist_vars list.
    
    With this change we wait until trigger actions are created so we can take
    into consideration if hist trigger has variable references. Also, now we
    check the return value of save_hist_vars() and fail trigger creation if
    save_hist_vars() fails.

    dm: verity-loadpin: Add NULL pointer check for 'bdev' parameter
    
    commit 47f04616f2c9b2f4f0c9127e30ca515a078db591 upstream.
    
    Add a NULL check for the 'bdev' parameter of
    dm_verity_loadpin_is_bdev_trusted(). The function is called
    by loadpin_check(), which passes the block device that
    corresponds to the super block of the file system from which
    a file is being loaded. Generally a super_block structure has
    an associated block device, however that is not always the
    case (e.g. tmpfs).

    s390/decompressor: fix misaligned symbol build error
    
    commit 938f0c35d7d93a822ab9c9728e3205e8e57409d0 upstream.
    
    Nathan Chancellor reported a kernel build error on Fedora 39:
    
    $ clang --version | head -1
    clang version 16.0.5 (Fedora 16.0.5-1.fc39)
    
    $ s390x-linux-gnu-ld --version | head -1
    GNU ld version 2.40-1.fc39
    
    $ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=s390 CC=clang CROSS_COMPILE=s390x-linux-gnu- olddefconfig all
    s390x-linux-gnu-ld: arch/s390/boot/startup.o(.text+0x5b4): misaligned symbol `_decompressor_end' (0x35b0f) for relocation R_390_PC32DBL
    make[3]: *** [.../arch/s390/boot/Makefile:78: arch/s390/boot/vmlinux] Error 1
    
    It turned out that the problem with misaligned symbols on s390 was fixed
    with commit 80ddf5ce1c92 ("s390: always build relocatable kernel") for the
    kernel image, but did not take into account that the decompressor uses its
    own set of CFLAGS, which come without -fPIE.
    
    Add the -fPIE flag also to the decompresser CFLAGS to fix this.

    The IXP4XX_EXP_T1_MASK was shifted one bit to the right, overlapping

    Revert "8250: add support for ASIX devices with a FIFO bug"
    
    commit a82d62f708545d22859584e0e0620da8e3759bbc upstream.
    
    This reverts commit eb26dfe8aa7eeb5a5aa0b7574550125f8aa4c3b3.
    
    Commit eb26dfe8aa7e ("8250: add support for ASIX devices with a FIFO
    bug") merged on Jul 13, 2012 adds a quirk for PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASIX
    (0x9710). But that ID is the same as PCI_VENDOR_ID_NETMOS defined in
    1f8b061050c7 ("[PATCH] Netmos parallel/serial/combo support") merged
    on Mar 28, 2005. In pci_serial_quirks array, the NetMos entry always
    takes precedence over the ASIX entry even since it was initially
    merged, code in that commit is always unreachable.
    
    In my tests, adding the FIFO workaround to pci_netmos_init() makes no
    difference, and the vendor driver also does not have such workaround.
    Given that the code was never used for over a decade, it's safe to
    revert it.
    
    Also, the real PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASIX should be 0x125b, which is used on
    their newer AX99100 PCIe serial controllers released on 2016. The FIFO
    workaround should not be intended for these newer controllers, and it
    was never implemented in vendor driver.

    opp: Fix use-after-free in lazy_opp_tables after probe deferral
    
    commit b2a2ab039bd58f51355e33d7d3fc64605d7f870d upstream.
    
    When dev_pm_opp_of_find_icc_paths() in _allocate_opp_table() returns
    -EPROBE_DEFER, the opp_table is freed again, to wait until all the
    interconnect paths are available.
    
    However, if the OPP table is using required-opps then it may already
    have been added to the global lazy_opp_tables list. The error path
    does not remove the opp_table from the list again.
    
    This can cause crashes later when the provider of the required-opps
    is added, since we will iterate over OPP tables that have already been
    freed. E.g.:
    
      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference when read
      CPU: 0 PID: 7 Comm: kworker/0:0 Not tainted 6.4.0-rc3
      PC is at _of_add_opp_table_v2 (include/linux/of.h:949
      drivers/opp/of.c:98 drivers/opp/of.c:344 drivers/opp/of.c:404
      drivers/opp/of.c:1032) -> lazy_link_required_opp_table()
    
    Fix this by calling _of_clear_opp_table() to remove the opp_table from
    the list and clear other allocated resources. While at it, also add the
    missing mutex_destroy() calls in the error path.

    field is 6-bit. Although all supported SoCs have the register

    arm64: errata: Mitigate Ampere1 erratum AC03_CPU_38 at stage-2
    
    commit 6df696cd9bc1ceed0e92e36908f88bbd16d18255 upstream.
    
    AmpereOne has an erratum in its implementation of FEAT_HAFDBS that
    required disabling the feature on the design. This was done by reporting
    the feature as not implemented in the ID register, although the
    corresponding control bits were not actually RES0. This does not align
    well with the requirements of the architecture, which mandates these
    bits be RES0 if HAFDBS isn't implemented.
    
    The kernel's use of stage-1 is unaffected, as the HA and HD bits are
    only set if HAFDBS is detected in the ID register. KVM, on the other
    hand, relies on the RES0 behavior at stage-2 to use the same value for
    VTCR_EL2 on any cpu in the system. Mitigate the non-RES0 behavior by
    leaving VTCR_EL2.HA clear on affected systems.

    nfp: clean mc addresses in application firmware when closing port
    
    commit cc7eab25b1cf3f9594fe61142d3523ce4d14a788 upstream.
    
    When moving devices from one namespace to another, mc addresses are
    cleaned in software while not removed from application firmware. Thus
    the mc addresses are remained and will cause resource leak.
    
    Now use `__dev_mc_unsync` to clean mc addresses when closing port.

    ceph: don't let check_caps skip sending responses for revoke msgs
    
    commit 257e6172ab36ebbe295a6c9ee9a9dd0fe54c1dc2 upstream.
    
    If a client sends out a cap update dropping caps with the prior 'seq'
    just before an incoming cap revoke request, then the client may drop
    the revoke because it believes it's already released the requested
    capabilities.
    
    This causes the MDS to wait indefinitely for the client to respond
    to the revoke. It's therefore always a good idea to ack the cap
    revoke request with the bumped up 'seq'.

    ceph: fix blindly expanding the readahead windows
    
    commit dc94bb8f271c079f69583d0f12a489aaf5202751 upstream.
    
    Blindly expanding the readahead windows will cause unneccessary
    pagecache thrashing and also will introduce the network workload.
    We should disable expanding the windows if the readahead is disabled
    and also shouldn't expand the windows too much.
    
    Expanding forward firstly instead of expanding backward for possible
    sequential reads.
    
    Bound `rreq->len` to the actual file size to restore the previous page
    cache usage.
    
    The posix_fadvise may change the maximum size of a file readahead.

    libceph: harden msgr2.1 frame segment length checks
    
    commit a282a2f10539dce2aa619e71e1817570d557fc97 upstream.
    
    ceph_frame_desc::fd_lens is an int array.  decode_preamble() thus
    effectively casts u32 -> int but the checks for segment lengths are
    written as if on unsigned values.  While reading in HELLO or one of the
    AUTH frames (before authentication is completed), arithmetic in
    head_onwire_len() can get duped by negative ctrl_len and produce
    head_len which is less than CEPH_PREAMBLE_LEN but still positive.
    This would lead to a buffer overrun in prepare_read_control() as the
    preamble gets copied to the newly allocated buffer of size head_len.

    tty: fix hang on tty device with no_room set
    
    commit 4903fde8047a28299d1fc79c1a0dcc255e928f12 upstream.
    
    It is possible to hang pty devices in this case, the reader was
    blocking at epoll on master side, the writer was sleeping at
    wait_woken inside n_tty_write on slave side, and the write buffer
    on tty_port was full, we found that the reader and writer would
    never be woken again and blocked forever.
    
    The problem was caused by a race between reader and kworker:
    n_tty_read(reader):  n_tty_receive_buf_common(kworker):
    copy_from_read_buf()|
                        |room = N_TTY_BUF_SIZE - (ldata->read_head - tail)
                        |room <= 0
    n_tty_kick_worker() |
                        |ldata->no_room = true
    
    After writing to slave device, writer wakes up kworker to flush
    data on tty_port to reader, and the kworker finds that reader
    has no room to store data so room <= 0 is met. At this moment,
    reader consumes all the data on reader buffer and calls
    n_tty_kick_worker to check ldata->no_room which is false and
    reader quits reading. Then kworker sets ldata->no_room=true
    and quits too.
    
    If write buffer is not full, writer will wake kworker to flush data
    again after following writes, but if write buffer is full and writer
    goes to sleep, kworker will never be woken again and tty device is
    blocked.
    
    This problem can be solved with a check for read buffer size inside
    n_tty_receive_buf_common, if read buffer is empty and ldata->no_room
    is true, a call to n_tty_kick_worker is necessary to keep flushing
    data to reader.

    tty: serial: imx: fix rs485 rx after tx
    
    commit 639949a7031e04c59ec91614eceb9543e9120f43 upstream.
    
    Since commit 79d0224f6bf2 ("tty: serial: imx: Handle RS485 DE signal
    active high") RS485 reception no longer works after a transmission.
    
    The following scenario shows the problem:
            1) Open a port in RS485 mode
            2) Receive data from remote (OK)
            3) Transmit data to remote (OK)
            4) Receive data from remote (Nothing received)
    
    In RS485 mode, imx_uart_start_tx() calls imx_uart_stop_rx() and, when the
    transmission is complete, imx_uart_stop_tx() calls imx_uart_start_rx().
    
    Since the above commit imx_uart_stop_rx() now sets the loopback bit but
    imx_uart_start_rx() does not clear it causing the hardware to remain in
    loopback mode and not receive external data.
    
    Fix this by moving the existing loopback disable code to a helper function
    and calling it from imx_uart_start_rx() too.

    commit 27a826837ec9a3e94cc44bd9328b8289b0fcecd7 upstream.
    
    The atmel_complete_tx_dma() function disables IRQs at the start
    of the function by calling spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags);
    There is no need to disable them a second time using the
    spin_lock_irq() function and, in fact, doing so is a bug because
    it will enable IRQs prematurely when we call spin_unlock_irq().

    drm/amd/display: Add monitor specific edid quirk
    
    commit 613a7956deb3b1ffa2810c6d4c90ee9c3d743dbb upstream.
    
    Disable FAMS on a Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor. Experiments show that this
    monitor does not work well under some use cases, and is likely
    implementation specific bug on the monitor's firmware.

    drm/amd/display: Correct `DMUB_FW_VERSION` macro
    
    commit 274d205cb59f43815542e04b42a9e6d0b9b95eff upstream.
    
    The `DMUB_FW_VERSION` macro has a mistake in that the revision field
    is off by one byte. The last byte is typically used for other purposes
    and not a revision.

    drm/amd/display: Fix 128b132b link loss handling
    
    commit ed83fe2abcace898fdec5c2ba0455703178ac9a3 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    We don't check 128b132b-specific bits in LANE_ALIGN_STATUS_UPDATED DPCD
    registers when parsing link loss status, which can cause us to miss a
    link loss notification from some sinks.

    drm/dp_mst: Clear MSG_RDY flag before sending new message
    
    commit 72f1de49ffb90b29748284f27f1d6b829ab1de95 upstream.
    
    [Why]
    The sequence for collecting down_reply from source perspective should
    be:
    
    Request_n->repeat (get partial reply of Request_n->clear message ready
    flag to ack DPRX that the message is received) till all partial
    replies for Request_n are received->new Request_n+1.
    
    Now there is chance that drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq() will fire new down
    request in the tx queue when the down reply is incomplete. Source is
    restricted to generate interveleaved message transactions so we should
    avoid it.
    
    Also, while assembling partial reply packets, reading out DPCD DOWN_REP
    Sideband MSG buffer + clearing DOWN_REP_MSG_RDY flag should be
    wrapped up as a complete operation for reading out a reply packet.
    Kicking off a new request before clearing DOWN_REP_MSG_RDY flag might
    be risky. e.g. If the reply of the new request has overwritten the
    DPRX DOWN_REP Sideband MSG buffer before source writing one to clear
    DOWN_REP_MSG_RDY flag, source then unintentionally flushes the reply
    for the new request. Should handle the up request in the same way.
    
    [How]
    Separete drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq() into 2 steps. After acking the MST IRQ
    event, driver calls drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq_send_new_request() and might
    trigger drm_dp_mst_kick_tx() only when there is no on going message
    transaction.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Reworked on review comments received
    -> Adjust the fix to let driver explicitly kick off new down request
    when mst irq event is handled and acked
    -> Adjust the commit message
    
    Changes since v2:
    * Adjust the commit message
    * Adjust the naming of the divided 2 functions and add a new input
      parameter "ack".
    * Adjust code flow as per review comments.
    
    Changes since v3:
    * Update the function description of drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq_handle_event
    
    Changes since v4:
    * Change ack of drm_dp_mst_hpd_irq_handle_event() to be an array align
      the size of esi[]

    drm/rockchip: vop: Leave vblank enabled in self-refresh
    
    commit 2bdba9d4a3baa758c2ca7f5b37b35c7b3391dc42 upstream.
    
    If we disable vblank when entering self-refresh, vblank APIs (like
    DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK) no longer work. But user space is not aware when
    we enter self-refresh, so this appears to be an API violation -- that
    DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK fails with EINVAL whenever the display is idle and
    enters self-refresh.
    
    The downstream driver used by many of these systems never used to
    disable vblank for PSR, and in fact, even upstream, we didn't do that
    until radically redesigning the state machine in commit 6c836d965bad
    ("drm/rockchip: Use the helpers for PSR").
    
    Thus, it seems like a reasonable API fix to simply restore that
    behavior, and leave vblank enabled.
    
    Note that this appears to potentially unbalance the
    drm_crtc_vblank_{off,on}() calls in some cases, but:
    (a) drm_crtc_vblank_on() documents this as OK and
    (b) if I do the naive balancing, I find state machine issues such that
        we're not in sync properly; so it's easier to take advantage of (a).
    
    This issue was exposed by IGT's kms_vblank tests, and reported by
    KernelCI. The bug has been around a while (longer than KernelCI
    noticed), but was only exposed once self-refresh was bugfixed more
    recently, and so KernelCI could properly test it. Some other notes in:

    == Backporting notes: ==
    
    Marking as 'Fixes' commit 6c836d965bad ("drm/rockchip: Use the helpers

    drm/atomic: Allow vblank-enabled + self-refresh "disable"
    
    commit 9d0e3cac3517942a6e00eeecfe583a98715edb16 upstream.
    
    The self-refresh helper framework overloads "disable" to sometimes mean
    "go into self-refresh mode," and this mode activates automatically
    (e.g., after some period of unchanging display output). In such cases,
    the display pipe is still considered "on", and user-space is not aware
    that we went into self-refresh mode. Thus, users may expect that
    vblank-related features (such as DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK) still work
    properly.
    
    However, we trigger the WARN_ONCE() here if a CRTC driver tries to leave
    vblank enabled.
    
    Add a different expectation: that CRTCs *should* leave vblank enabled
    when going into self-refresh.
    
    This patch is preparation for another patch -- "drm/rockchip: vop: Leave
    vblank enabled in self-refresh" -- which resolves conflicts between the
    above self-refresh behavior and the API tests in IGT's kms_vblank test
    module.
    
    == Some alternatives discussed: ==
    
    It's likely that on many display controllers, vblank interrupts will
    turn off when the CRTC is disabled, and so in some cases, self-refresh
    may not support vblank. To support such cases, we might consider
    additions to the generic helpers such that we fire vblank events based
    on a timer.
    
    However, there is currently only one driver using the common
    self-refresh helpers (i.e., rockchip), and at least as of commit
    bed030a49f3e ("drm/rockchip: Don't fully disable vop on self refresh"),
    the CRTC hardware is powered enough to continue to generate vblank
    interrupts.
    
    So we chose the simpler option of leaving vblank interrupts enabled. We
    can reevaluate this decision and perhaps augment the helpers if/when we
    gain a second driver that has different requirements.
    
    v3:
     * include discussion summary
    
    v2:
     * add 'ret != 0' warning case for self-refresh
     * describe failing test case and relation to drm/rockchip patch better

    the lpfc_nlp_put() at the end of the routine.  If ndlp's rpi was
    registered, then lpfc_unreg_rpi()'s completion routine performs the final
    ndlp clean up after lpfc_nlp_put() is called from lpfc_cmpl_els_logo_acc().
    Otherwise if ndlp has no rpi registered, the lpfc_nlp_put() at the end of
    lpfc_cmpl_els_logo_acc() is the final ndlp clean up.

    fs: dlm: fix mismatch of plock results from userspace
    
    commit 57e2c2f2d94cfd551af91cedfa1af6d972487197 upstream.
    
    When a waiting plock request (F_SETLKW) is sent to userspace
    for processing (dlm_controld), the result is returned at a
    later time. That result could be incorrectly matched to a
    different waiting request in cases where the owner field is
    the same (e.g. different threads in a process.) This is fixed
    by comparing all the properties in the request and reply.
    
    The results for non-waiting plock requests are now matched
    based on list order because the results are returned in the
    same order they were sent.

    If a posix lock request is waiting for a result from user space

    that all locks were cleared on any signal interrupt. If a signal
    was received that did not terminate the process, the process
    could continue running after all its dlm posix locks had been
    cleared. A future patch will add cancelation to allow proper
    interruption.

    md/raid0: add discard support for the 'original' layout
    
    commit e836007089ba8fdf24e636ef2b007651fb4582e6 upstream.
    
    We've found that using raid0 with the 'original' layout and discard
    enabled with different disk sizes (such that at least two zones are
    created) can result in data corruption. This is due to the fact that
    the discard handling in 'raid0_handle_discard()' assumes the 'alternate'
    layout. We've seen this corruption using ext4 but other filesystems are
    likely susceptible as well.
    
    More specifically, while multiple zones are necessary to create the
    corruption, the corruption may not occur with multiple zones if they
    layout in such a way the layout matches what the 'alternate' layout
    would have produced. Thus, not all raid0 devices with the 'original'
    layout, different size disks and discard enabled will encounter this
    corruption.
    
    The 3.14 kernel inadvertently changed the raid0 disk layout for different
    size disks. Thus, running a pre-3.14 kernel and post-3.14 kernel on the
    same raid0 array could corrupt data. This lead to the creation of the
    'original' layout (to match the pre-3.14 layout) and the 'alternate' layout
    (to match the post 3.14 layout) in the 5.4 kernel time frame and an option
    to tell the kernel which layout to use (since it couldn't be autodetected).
    However, when the 'original' layout was added back to 5.4 discard support
    for the 'original' layout was not added leading this issue.
    
    I've been able to reliably reproduce the corruption with the following
    test case:
    
    1. create raid0 array with different size disks using original layout
    2. mkfs
    3. mount -o discard
    4. create lots of files
    5. remove 1/2 the files
    6. fstrim -a (or just the mount point for the raid0 array)
    7. umount
    8. fsck -fn /dev/md0 (spews all sorts of corruptions)
    
    Let's fix this by adding proper discard support to the 'original' layout.
    The fix 'maps' the 'original' layout disks to the order in which they are
    read/written such that we can compare the disks in the same way that the
    current 'alternate' layout does. A 'disk_shift' field is added to
    'struct strip_zone'. This could be computed on the fly in
    raid0_handle_discard() but by adding this field, we save some computation
    in the discard path.
    
    Note we could also potentially fix this by re-ordering the disks in the
    zones that follow the first one, and then always read/writing them using
    the 'alternate' layout. However, that is seen as a more substantial change,
    and we are attempting the least invasive fix at this time to remedy the
    corruption.
    
    I've verified the change using the reproducer mentioned above. Typically,
    the corruption is seen after less than 3 iterations, while the patch has
    run 500+ iterations.

    misc: pci_endpoint_test: Re-init completion for every test
    
    commit fb620ae73b70c2f57b9d3e911fc24c024ba2324f upstream.
    
    The irq_raised completion used to detect the end of a test case is
    initialized when the test device is probed, but never reinitialized again
    before a test case. As a result, the irq_raised completion synchronization
    is effective only for the first ioctl test case executed. Any subsequent
    call to wait_for_completion() by another ioctl() call will immediately
    return, potentially too early, leading to false positive failures.
    
    Fix this by reinitializing the irq_raised completion before starting a new
    ioctl() test command.

    PCI: rockchip: Assert PCI Configuration Enable bit after probe
    
    commit f397fd4ac1fa3afcabd8cee030f953ccaed2a364 upstream.
    
    Assert PCI Configuration Enable bit after probe. When this bit is left to
    0 in the endpoint mode, the RK3399 PCIe endpoint core will generate
    configuration request retry status (CRS) messages back to the root complex.
    Assert this bit after probe to allow the RK3399 PCIe endpoint core to reply
    to configuration requests from the root complex.
    This is documented in section 17.5.8.1.2 of the RK3399 TRM.

    PCI: epf-test: Fix DMA transfer completion detection
    
    commit 933f31a2fe1f20e5b1ee065579f652cd1b317183 upstream.
    
    pci_epf_test_data_transfer() and pci_epf_test_dma_callback() are not
    handling DMA transfer completion correctly, leading to completion
    notifications to the RC side that are too early. This problem can be
    detected when the RC side is running an IOMMU with messages such as:
    
      pci-endpoint-test 0000:0b:00.0: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x001c address=0xfff00000 flags=0x0000]
    
    When running the pcitest.sh tests: the address used for a previous
    test transfer generates the above error while the next test transfer is
    running.
    
    Fix this by testing the DMA transfer status in pci_epf_test_dma_callback()
    and notifying the completion only when the transfer status is DMA_COMPLETE
    or DMA_ERROR. Furthermore, in pci_epf_test_data_transfer(), be paranoid and
    check again the transfer status and always call dmaengine_terminate_sync()
    before returning.

    commit 88d341716b83abd355558523186ca488918627ee upstream.
    
    Marvell's own product brief implies the 92xx series are a closely related
    family, and sure enough it turns out that 9235 seems to need the same quirk
    as the other three, although possibly only when certain ports are used.

    PCI: Release resource invalidated by coalescing
    
    commit e54223275ba1bc6f704a6bab015fcd2ae4f72572 upstream.
    
    When contiguous windows are coalesced by pci_register_host_bridge(), the
    second resource is expanded to include the first, and the first is
    invalidated and consequently not added to the bus. However, it remains in
    the resource hierarchy.  For example, these windows:
    
      fec00000-fec7ffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
      fec80000-fecbffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
    
    are coalesced into this, where the first resource remains in the tree with
    start/end zeroed out:
    
      00000000-00000000 : PCI Bus 0000:00
      fec00000-fecbffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
    
    In some cases (e.g. the Xen scratch region), this causes future calls to
    allocate_resource() to choose an inappropriate location which the caller
    cannot handle.
    
    Fix by releasing the zeroed-out resource and removing it from the resource
    hierarchy.

    s390/zcrypt: do not retry administrative requests
    
    commit af40322e90d4e0093569eceb7d3a28ab635f3e75 upstream.
    
    All kind of administrative requests should not been retried. Some card
    firmware detects this and assumes a replay attack. This patch checks
    on failure if the low level functions indicate a retry (EAGAIN) and
    checks for the ADMIN flag set on the request message.  If this both
    are true, the response code for this message is changed to EIO to make
    sure the zcrypt API layer does not attempt to retry the request. As of
    now the ADMIN flag is set for a request message when
    - for EP11 the field 'flags' of the EP11 CPRB struct has the leftmost
      bit set.
    - for CCA when the CPRB minor version is 'T3', 'T5', 'T6' or 'T7'.
    
    Please note that the do-not-retry only applies to a request
    which has been sent to the card (= has been successfully enqueued) but
    the reply indicates some kind of failure and by default it would be
    replied. It is totally fine to retry a request if a previous attempt
    to enqueue the msg into the firmware queue had some kind of failure
    and thus the card has never seen this request.

    dm integrity: reduce vmalloc space footprint on 32-bit architectures
    
    commit 6d50eb4725934fd22f5eeccb401000687c790fd0 upstream.
    
    It was reported that dm-integrity runs out of vmalloc space on 32-bit
    architectures. On x86, there is only 128MiB vmalloc space and dm-integrity
    consumes it quickly because it has a 64MiB journal and 8MiB recalculate
    buffer.
    
    Fix this by reducing the size of the journal to 4MiB and the size of
    the recalculate buffer to 1MiB, so that multiple dm-integrity devices
    can be created and activated on 32-bit architectures.

    jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting
    
    commit 11509910c599cbd04585ec35a6d5e1a0053d84c1 upstream.
    
    In jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block
    number inside dbFree(). db_l2nbperpage, which is the log2 number of
    blocks per page, is passed as an argument to BLKTODMAP which uses it
    for shifting.
    
    Syzbot reported a shift out-of-bounds crash because db_l2nbperpage is
    too big. This happens because the large value is set without any
    validation in dbMount() at line 181.
    
    Thus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.
    
    Max number of blocks per page = Page size / Min block size
    => log2(Max num_block per page) = log2(Page size / Min block size)
                                    = log2(Page size) - log2(Min block size)
    
    => Max db_l2nbperpage = L2PSIZE - L2MINBLOCKSIZE

    ext2/dax: Fix ext2_setsize when len is page aligned
    
    commit fcced95b6ba2a507a83b8b3e0358a8ac16b13e35 upstream.
    
    PAGE_ALIGN(x) macro gives the next highest value which is multiple of
    pagesize. But if x is already page aligned then it simply returns x.
    So, if x passed is 0 in dax_zero_range() function, that means the
    length gets passed as 0 to ->iomap_begin().
    
    In ext2 it then calls ext2_get_blocks -> max_blocks as 0 and hits bug_on
    here in ext2_get_blocks().
            BUG_ON(maxblocks == 0);
    
    Instead we should be calling dax_truncate_page() here which takes
    care of it. i.e. it only calls dax_zero_range if the offset is not
    page/block aligned.
    
    This can be easily triggered with following on fsdax mounted pmem
    device.
    
    dd if=/dev/zero of=file count=1 bs=512
    truncate -s 0 file

    soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Fix unconditional call to scm_pas_mem_setup
    
    commit bcb889891371c3cf767f2b9e8768cfe2fdd3810f upstream.
    
    Commit ebeb20a9cd3f ("soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Always invoke PAS
    mem_setup") dropped the relocate check and made pas_mem_setup run
    unconditionally. The code was later moved with commit f4e526ff7e38
    ("soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Extract PAS operations") to
    qcom_mdt_pas_init() effectively losing track of what was actually
    done.
    
    The assumption that PAS mem_setup can be done anytime was effectively
    wrong, with no good reason and this caused regression on some SoC
    that use remoteproc to bringup ath11k. One example is IPQ8074 SoC that
    effectively broke resulting in remoteproc silently die and ath11k not
    working.
    
    On this SoC FW relocate is not enabled and PAS mem_setup was correctly
    skipped in previous kernel version resulting in correct bringup and
    function of remoteproc and ath11k.
    
    To fix the regression, reintroduce the relocate check in
    qcom_mdt_pas_init() and correctly skip PAS mem_setup where relocate is
    not enabled.

    mm/mmap: Fix error return in do_vmi_align_munmap()
    
    commit 6c26bd4384da24841bac4f067741bbca18b0fb74 upstream.
    
    If mas_store_gfp() in the gather loop failed, the 'error' variable that
    ultimately gets returned was not being set. In many cases, its original
    value of -ENOMEM was still in place, and that was fine. But if VMAs had
    been split at the start or end of the range, then 'error' could be zero.
    
    Change to the 'error = foo(); if (error) goto ‚Ä¶' idiom to fix the bug.
    
    Also clean up a later case which avoided the same bug by *explicitly*
    setting error = -ENOMEM right before calling the function that might
    return -ENOMEM.
    
    In a final cosmetic change, move the 'Point of no return' comment to
    *after* the goto. That's been in the wrong place since the preallocation
    was removed, and this new error path was added.

    fs: dlm: revert check required context while close
    
    commit c6b6d6dcc7f32767d57740e0552337c8de40610b upstream.
    
    This patch reverts commit 2c3fa6ae4d52 ("dlm: check required context
    while close"). The function dlm_midcomms_close(), which will call later
    dlm_lowcomms_close(), is called when the cluster manager tells the node
    got fenced which means on midcomms/lowcomms layer to disconnect the node
    from the cluster communication. The node can rejoin the cluster later.
    This patch was ensuring no new message were able to be triggered when we
    are in the close() function context. This was done by checking if the
    lockspace has been stopped. However there is a missing check that we
    only need to check specific lockspaces where the fenced node is member
    of. This is currently complicated because there is no way to easily
    check if a node is part of a specific lockspace without stopping the
    recovery. For now we just revert this commit as it is just a check to
    finding possible leaks of stopping lockspaces before close() is called.

    ext4: only update i_reserved_data_blocks on successful block allocation
    
    commit de25d6e9610a8b30cce9bbb19b50615d02ebca02 upstream.
    
    In our fault injection test, we create an ext4 file, migrate it to
    non-extent based file, then punch a hole and finally trigger a WARN_ON
    in the ext4_da_update_reserve_space():
    
    EXT4-fs warning (device sda): ext4_da_update_reserve_space:369:
    ino 14, used 11 with only 10 reserved data blocks
    
    When writing back a non-extent based file, if we enable delalloc, the
    number of reserved blocks will be subtracted from the number of blocks
    mapped by ext4_ind_map_blocks(), and the extent status tree will be
    updated. We update the extent status tree by first removing the old
    extent_status and then inserting the new extent_status. If the block range
    we remove happens to be in an extent, then we need to allocate another
    extent_status with ext4_es_alloc_extent().
    
           use old    to remove   to add new
        |----------|------------|------------|
                  old extent_status
    
    The problem is that the allocation of a new extent_status failed due to a
    fault injection, and __es_shrink() did not get free memory, resulting in
    a return of -ENOMEM. Then do_writepages() retries after receiving -ENOMEM,
    we map to the same extent again, and the number of reserved blocks is again
    subtracted from the number of blocks in that extent. Since the blocks in
    the same extent are subtracted twice, we end up triggering WARN_ON at
    ext4_da_update_reserve_space() because used > ei->i_reserved_data_blocks.
    
    For non-extent based file, we update the number of reserved blocks after
    ext4_ind_map_blocks() is executed, which causes a problem that when we call
    ext4_ind_map_blocks() to create a block, it doesn't always create a block,
    but we always reduce the number of reserved blocks. So we move the logic
    for updating reserved blocks to ext4_ind_map_blocks() to ensure that the
    number of reserved blocks is updated only after we do succeed in allocating
    some new blocks.

    ext4: turn quotas off if mount failed after enabling quotas

    ext4: avoid updating the superblock on a r/o mount if not needed
    
    commit 2ef6c32a914b85217b44a0a2418e830e520b085e upstream.
    
    This was noticed by a user who noticied that the mtime of a file
    backing a loopback device was getting bumped when the loopback device
    is mounted read/only.  Note: This doesn't show up when doing a
    loopback mount of a file directly, via "mount -o ro /tmp/foo.img
    /mnt", since the loop device is set read-only when mount automatically
    creates loop device.  However, this is noticeable for a LUKS loop
    device like this:
    
    % cryptsetup luksOpen /tmp/foo.img test
    % mount -o ro /dev/loop0 /mnt ; umount /mnt
    
    or, if LUKS is not in use, if the user manually creates the loop
    device like this:
    
    % losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/foo.img
    % mount -o ro /dev/loop0 /mnt ; umount /mnt
    
    The modified mtime causes rsync to do a rolling checksum scan of the
    file on the local and remote side, incrementally increasing the time
    to rsync the not-modified-but-touched image file.

        // cannot drop buffer head.
       blkdev_put
        blkdev_put_whole
         if (atomic_dec_and_test(&bdev->bd_openers))
         // false, systemd-udev happens to open the device. Then
         // blkdev_flush_mapping->kill_bdev->truncate_inode_pages->

         // filemap_release_folio->try_to_free_buffers will be skipped,
         // dropping buffer head is missed again.

    The filesystem is corrupted here, journal is partially replayed, and
    new journal sequence number actually is already used by last mounting.
    
    The invalidate_bdev() can drop all buffer heads even racing with bare
    reading block device(eg. systemd-udev), so we can fix it by invalidating
    bdev in error handling path in __ext4_fill_super().

    MIPS: Loongson: Fix build error when make modules_install
    
    commit 531b3d1195d096f14e030c4b01ec3a53b80276bf upstream.
    
    After commit 0e96ea5c3eb5904e5dc2f ("MIPS: Loongson64: Clean up use of
    cc-ifversion") we get a build error when make modules_install:
    
    cc1: error: '-mloongson-mmi' must be used with '-mhard-float'
    
    The reason is when make modules_install, 'call cc-option' doesn't work
    in $(KBUILD_CFLAGS) of 'CHECKFLAGS'. Then there is no -mno-loongson-mmi
    applied and -march=loongson3a enable MMI instructions.
    
    To be detail, the error message comes from the CHECKFLAGS invocation of
    $(CC) but it has no impact on the final result of make modules_install,
    it is purely a cosmetic issue. The error occurs because cc-option is
    defined in scripts/Makefile.compiler, which is not included in Makefile
    when running 'make modules_install', as install targets are not supposed
    to require the compiler; see commit 805b2e1d427aab4b ("kbuild: include
    Makefile.compiler only when compiler is needed"). As a result, the call
    to check for '-mno-loongson-mmi' just never happens.
    
    Fix this by partially reverting to the old logic, use 'call cc-option'
    to conditionally apply -march=loongson3a and -march=mips64r2.
    
    By the way, Loongson-2E/2F is also broken in commit 13ceb48bc19c563e05f4
    ("MIPS: Loongson2ef: Remove unnecessary {as,cc}-option calls") so fix it
    together.

    MIPS: Loongson: Fix cpu_probe_loongson() again
    
    commit 65fee014dc41a774bcd94896f3fb380bc39d8dda upstream.
    
    Commit 7db5e9e9e5e6c10d7d ("MIPS: loongson64: fix FTLB configuration")
    move decode_configs() from the beginning of cpu_probe_loongson() to the
    end in order to fix FTLB configuration. However, it breaks the CPUCFG
    decoding because decode_configs() use "c->options = xxxx" rather than
    "c->options |= xxxx", all information get from CPUCFG by decode_cpucfg()
    is lost.
    
    This causes error when creating a KVM guest on Loongson-3A4000:
    Exception Code: 4 not handled @ PC: 0000000087ad5981, inst: 0xcb7a1898 BadVaddr: 0x0 Status: 0x0
    
    Fix this by moving the c->cputype setting to the beginning and moving
    decode_configs() after that.

    MIPS: cpu-features: Use boot_cpu_type for CPU type based features
    
    commit 5487a7b60695a92cf998350e4beac17144c91fcd upstream.
    
    Some CPU feature macros were using current_cpu_type to mark feature
    availability.
    
    However current_cpu_type will use smp_processor_id, which is prohibited
    under preemptable context.
    
    Since those features are all uniform on all CPUs in a SMP system, use
    boot_cpu_type instead of current_cpu_type to fix preemptable kernel.

    drm/amd/display: perform a bounds check before filling dirty rectangles
    
    commit af22d6a869cc26b519bfdcd54293c53f2e491870 upstream.
    
    Currently, it is possible for us to access memory that we shouldn't.
    Since, we acquire (possibly dangling) pointers to dirty rectangles
    before doing a bounds check to make sure we can actually accommodate the
    number of dirty rectangles userspace has requested to fill. This issue
    is especially evident if a compositor requests both MPO and damage clips
    at the same time, in which case I have observed a soft-hang. So, to
    avoid this issue, perform the bounds check before filling a single dirty
    rectangle and WARN() about it, if it is ever attempted in
    fill_dc_dirty_rect().

    powerpc/security: Fix Speculation_Store_Bypass reporting on Power10
    
    commit 5bcedc5931e7bd6928a2d8207078d4cb476b3b55 upstream.
    
    Nageswara reported that /proc/self/status was showing "vulnerable" for
    the Speculation_Store_Bypass feature on Power10, eg:
    
      $ grep Speculation_Store_Bypass: /proc/self/status
      Speculation_Store_Bypass:       vulnerable
    
    But at the same time the sysfs files, and lscpu, were showing "Not
    affected".
    
    This turns out to simply be a bug in the reporting of the
    Speculation_Store_Bypass, aka. PR_SPEC_STORE_BYPASS, case.
    
    When SEC_FTR_STF_BARRIER was added, so that firmware could communicate
    the vulnerability was not present, the code in ssb_prctl_get() was not
    updated to check the new flag.
    
    So add the check for SEC_FTR_STF_BARRIER being disabled. Rather than
    adding the new check to the existing if block and expanding the comment
    to cover both cases, rewrite the three cases to be separate so they can

    misc: fastrpc: Create fastrpc scalar with correct buffer count
    
    commit 0b4e32df3e09406b835d8230b9331273f2805058 upstream.
    
    A process can spawn a PD on DSP with some attributes that can be
    associated with the PD during spawn and run. The invocation
    corresponding to the create request with attributes has total
    4 buffers at the DSP side implementation. If this number is not
    correct, the invocation is expected to fail on DSP. Added change
    to use correct number of buffer count for creating fastrpc scalar.

    powerpc: Fail build if using recordmcount with binutils v2.37
    
    commit 25ea739ea1d4d3de41acc4f4eb2d1a97eee0eb75 upstream.
    
    binutils v2.37 drops unused section symbols, which prevents recordmcount
    from capturing mcount locations in sections that have no non-weak
    symbols. This results in a build failure with a message such as:
            Cannot find symbol for section 12: .text.perf_callchain_kernel.
            kernel/events/callchain.o: failed
    
    The change to binutils was reverted for v2.38, so this behavior is
    specific to binutils v2.37:
    https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=c09c8b42021180eee9495bd50d8b35e683d3901b
    
    Objtool is able to cope with such sections, so this issue is specific to
    recordmcount.
    
    Fail the build and print a warning if binutils v2.37 is detected and if
    we are using recordmcount.

    kasan: fix type cast in memory_is_poisoned_n
    
    commit 05c56e7b4319d7f6352f27da876a1acdc8fa5cc4 upstream.
    
    Commit bb6e04a173f0 ("kasan: use internal prototypes matching gcc-13
    builtins") introduced a bug into the memory_is_poisoned_n implementation:
    it effectively removed the cast to a signed integer type after applying
    KASAN_GRANULE_MASK.
    
    As a result, KASAN started failing to properly check memset, memcpy, and
    other similar functions.
    
    Fix the bug by adding the cast back (through an additional signed integer
    variable to make the code more readable).

    kasan, slub: fix HW_TAGS zeroing with slub_debug
    
    commit fdb54d96600aafe45951f549866cd6fc1af59954 upstream.
    
    Commit 946fa0dbf2d8 ("mm/slub: extend redzone check to extra allocated
    kmalloc space than requested") added precise kmalloc redzone poisoning to
    the slub_debug functionality.
    
    However, this commit didn't account for HW_TAGS KASAN fully initializing
    the object via its built-in memory initialization feature.  Even though
    HW_TAGS KASAN memory initialization contains special memory initialization
    handling for when slub_debug is enabled, it does not account for in-object
    slub_debug redzones.  As a result, HW_TAGS KASAN can overwrite these
    redzones and cause false-positive slub_debug reports.
    
    To fix the issue, avoid HW_TAGS KASAN memory initialization when
    slub_debug is enabled altogether.  Implement this by moving the
    __slub_debug_enabled check to slab_post_alloc_hook.  Common slab code
    seems like a more appropriate place for a slub_debug check anyway.

    kasan: use internal prototypes matching gcc-13 builtins
    
    commit bb6e04a173f06e51819a4bb512e127dfbc50dcfa upstream.
    
    gcc-13 warns about function definitions for builtin interfaces that have a
    different prototype, e.g.:
    
    In file included from kasan_test.c:31:
    kasan.h:574:6: error: conflicting types for built-in function '__asan_register_globals'; expected 'void(void *, long int)' [-Werror=builtin-declaration-mismatch]
      574 | void __asan_register_globals(struct kasan_global *globals, size_t size);
    kasan.h:577:6: error: conflicting types for built-in function '__asan_alloca_poison'; expected 'void(void *, long int)' [-Werror=builtin-declaration-mismatch]
      577 | void __asan_alloca_poison(unsigned long addr, size_t size);
    kasan.h:580:6: error: conflicting types for built-in function '__asan_load1'; expected 'void(void *)' [-Werror=builtin-declaration-mismatch]
      580 | void __asan_load1(unsigned long addr);
    kasan.h:581:6: error: conflicting types for built-in function '__asan_store1'; expected 'void(void *)' [-Werror=builtin-declaration-mismatch]
      581 | void __asan_store1(unsigned long addr);
    kasan.h:643:6: error: conflicting types for built-in function '__hwasan_tag_memory'; expected 'void(void *, unsigned char,  long int)' [-Werror=builtin-declaration-mismatch]
      643 | void __hwasan_tag_memory(unsigned long addr, u8 tag, unsigned long size);
    
    The two problems are:
    
     - Addresses are passes as 'unsigned long' in the kernel, but gcc-13
       expects a 'void *'.
    
     - sizes meant to use a signed ssize_t rather than size_t.
    
    Change all the prototypes to match these.  Using 'void *' consistently for
    addresses gets rid of a couple of type casts, so push that down to the
    leaf functions where possible.
    
    This now passes all randconfig builds on arm, arm64 and x86, but I have
    not tested it on the other architectures that support kasan, since they
    tend to fail randconfig builds in other ways.  This might fail if any of
    the 32-bit architectures expect a 'long' instead of 'int' for the size
    argument.
    
    The __asan_allocas_unpoison() function prototype is somewhat weird, since
    it uses a pointer for 'stack_top' and an size_t for 'stack_bottom'.  This
    looks like it is meant to be 'addr' and 'size' like the others, but the
    implementation clearly treats them as 'top' and 'bottom'.

    net: phy: dp83td510: fix kernel stall during netboot in DP83TD510E PHY driver
    
    commit fc0649395dca81f2b3b02d9b248acb38cbcee55c upstream.
    
    Fix an issue where the kernel would stall during netboot, showing the
    "sched: RT throttling activated" message. This stall was triggered by
    the behavior of the mii_interrupt bit (Bit 7 - DP83TD510E_STS_MII_INT)
    in the DP83TD510E's PHY_STS Register (Address = 0x10). The DP83TD510E
    datasheet (2020) states that the bit clears on write, however, in
    practice, the bit clears on read.
    
    This discrepancy had significant implications on the driver's interrupt
    handling. The PHY_STS Register was used by handle_interrupt() to check
    for pending interrupts and by read_status() to get the current link
    status. The call to read_status() was unintentionally clearing the
    mii_interrupt status bit without deasserting the IRQ pin, causing
    handle_interrupt() to miss other pending interrupts. This issue was most
    apparent during netboot.
    
    The fix refrains from using the PHY_STS Register for interrupt handling.
    Instead, we now solely rely on the INTERRUPT_REG_1 Register (Address =
    0x12) and INTERRUPT_REG_2 Register (Address = 0x13) for this purpose.
    These registers directly influence the IRQ pin state and are latched
    high until read.
    
    Note: The INTERRUPT_REG_2 Register (Address = 0x13) exists and can also
    be used for interrupt handling, specifically for "Aneg page received
    interrupt" and "Polarity change interrupt". However, these features are
    currently not supported by this driver.

    commit 1b5ea7ffb7a3bdfffb4b7f40ce0d20a3372ee405 upstream.
    
    With support for Ethernet PHY LEDs having been added, while
    unregistering a MDIO bus and its child device liks PHYs there may be
    "late" accesses to the MDIO bus. One typical use case is setting the PHY
    LEDs brightness to OFF for instance.

    tpm,tpm_tis: Disable interrupts after 1000 unhandled IRQs
    
    commit 481c2d14627de8ecbb54dd125466e4b4a5069b47 upstream.
    
    After activation of interrupts for TPM TIS drivers 0-day reports an
    interrupt storm on an Inspur NF5180M6 server.
    
    Fix this by detecting the storm and falling back to polling:
    Count the number of unhandled interrupts within a 10 ms time interval. In
    case that more than 1000 were unhandled deactivate interrupts entirely,
    deregister the handler and use polling instead.
    
    Also print a note to point to the tpm_tis_dmi_table.
    
    Since the interrupt deregistration function devm_free_irq() waits for all
    interrupt handlers to finish, only trigger a worker in the interrupt
    handler and do the unregistration in the worker to avoid a deadlock.
    
    Note: the storm detection logic equals the implementation in
    note_interrupt() which uses timestamps and counters stored in struct
    irq_desc. Since this structure is private to the generic interrupt core
    the TPM TIS core uses its own timestamps and counters. Furthermore the TPM
    interrupt handler always returns IRQ_HANDLED to prevent the generic
    interrupt core from processing the interrupt storm.

    tpm: return false from tpm_amd_is_rng_defective on non-x86 platforms
    
    commit ecff6813d2bcf0c670881a9ba3f51cb032dd405a upstream.
    
    tpm_amd_is_rng_defective is for dealing with an issue related to the
    AMD firmware TPM, so on non-x86 architectures just have it inline and
    return false.

    pinctrl: amd: Use amd_pinconf_set() for all config options
    
    commit 635a750d958e158e17af0f524bedc484b27fbb93 upstream.
    
    On ASUS TUF A16 it is reported that the ITE5570 ACPI device connected to
    GPIO 7 is causing an interrupt storm.  This issue doesn't happen on
    Windows.
    
    Comparing the GPIO register configuration between Windows and Linux
    bit 20 has been configured as a pull up on Windows, but not on Linux.
    Checking GPIO declaration from the firmware it is clear it *should* have
    been a pull up on Linux as well.
    
    ```
    GpioInt (Level, ActiveLow, Exclusive, PullUp, 0x0000,
             "\\_SB.GPIO", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,)
    {   // Pin list
    0x0007
    }
    ```
    
    On Linux amd_gpio_set_config() is currently only used for programming
    the debounce. Actually the GPIO core calls it with all the arguments
    that are supported by a GPIO, pinctrl-amd just responds `-ENOTSUPP`.
    
    To solve this issue expand amd_gpio_set_config() to support the other
    arguments amd_pinconf_set() supports, namely `PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_DOWN`,
    `PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP`, and `PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH`.

    pinctrl: amd: Revert "pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe"
    
    commit 65f6c7c91cb2ebacbf155e0f881f81e79f90d138 upstream.
    
    commit 4e5a04be88fe ("pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe")
    was well intentioned to mask a firmware issue on a surface laptop, but it
    has a few problems:
    1. It had a bug in the loop handling for iteration 63 that lead to other
       problems with GPIO0 handling.
    2. It disables interrupts that are used internally by the SOC but masked
       by default.
    3. It masked a real firmware problem in some chromebooks that should have
       been caught during development but wasn't.
    
    There has been a lot of other development around s2idle; particularly
    around handling of the spurious wakeups.  If there is still a problem on
    the original reported surface laptop it should be avoided by adding a quirk
    to gpiolib-acpi for that system instead.

    pinctrl: amd: Detect and mask spurious interrupts
    
    commit 0cf9e48ff22e15f3f0882991f33d23ccc5ae1d01 upstream.
    
    Leverage gpiochip_line_is_irq to check whether a pin has an irq
    associated with it. The previous check ("irq == 0") didn't make much
    sense. The irq variable refers to the pinctrl irq, and has nothing do to
    with an individual pin.
    
    On some systems, during suspend/resume cycle, the firmware leaves
    an interrupt enabled on a pin that is not used by the kernel.
    Without this patch that caused an interrupt storm.

    pinctrl: amd: Detect internal GPIO0 debounce handling
    
    commit 968ab9261627fa305307e3935ca1a32fcddd36cb upstream.
    
    commit 4e5a04be88fe ("pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe")
    had a mistake in loop iteration 63 that it would clear offset 0xFC instead
    of 0x100.  Offset 0xFC is actually `WAKE_INT_MASTER_REG`.  This was
    clearing bits 13 and 15 from the register which significantly changed the
    expected handling for some platforms for GPIO0.
    
    commit b26cd9325be4 ("pinctrl: amd: Disable and mask interrupts on resume")
    actually fixed this bug, but lead to regressions on Lenovo Z13 and some
    other systems.  This is because there was no handling in the driver for bit
    15 debounce behavior.
    
    Quoting a public BKDG:
    ```
    EnWinBlueBtn. Read-write. Reset: 0. 0=GPIO0 detect debounced power button;
    Power button override is 4 seconds. 1=GPIO0 detect debounced power button
    in S3/S5/S0i3, and detect "pressed less than 2 seconds" and "pressed 2~10
    seconds" in S0; Power button override is 10 seconds
    ```
    
    Cross referencing the same master register in Windows it's obvious that
    Windows doesn't use debounce values in this configuration.  So align the
    Linux driver to do this as well.  This fixes wake on lid when
    WAKE_INT_MASTER_REG is properly programmed.

    commit 8ae071fc216a25f4f797f33c56857f4dd6b4408e upstream.
    
    Josh Triplett reports that initramfs-tools needs modules.builtin and
    modules.builtin.modinfo to create a working initramfs for a non-modular
    kernel.
    
    If this is a general tooling issue not limited to Debian, I think it
    makes sense to change modules_install.
    
    This commit changes the targets as follows when CONFIG_MODULES=n.
    
    In-tree builds:
      make modules          -> no-op
      make modules_install  -> install modules.builtin(.modinfo)
    
    External module builds:
      make modules          -> show error message like before
      make modules_install  -> show error message like before

    commit 458c15dfbce62c35fefd9ca637b20a051309c9f1 upstream.
    
    syzbot reports a bug as below:

    The root cause is race condition as below:
    - since it tries to remount rw filesystem, so that do_remount won't
    call sb_prepare_remount_readonly to block fallocate, there may be race
    condition in between remount and fallocate.
    - in f2fs_remount(), default_options() will reset mount option to default
    one, and then update it based on result of parse_options(), so there is
    a hole which race condition can happen.

    drm/client: Send hotplug event after registering a client
    
    commit 27655b9bb9f0d9c32b8de8bec649b676898c52d5 upstream.
    
    Generate a hotplug event after registering a client to allow the
    client to configure its display. Remove the hotplug calls from the
    existing clients for fbdev emulation. This change fixes a concurrency
    bug between registering a client and receiving events from the DRM
    core. The bug is present in the fbdev emulation of all drivers.
    
    The fbdev emulation currently generates a hotplug event before
    registering the client to the device. For each new output, the DRM
    core sends an additional hotplug event to each registered client.
    
    If the DRM core detects first output between sending the artificial
    hotplug and registering the device, the output's hotplug event gets
    lost. If this is the first output, the fbdev console display remains
    dark. This has been observed with amdgpu and fbdev-generic.
    
    Fix this by adding hotplug generation directly to the client's
    register helper drm_client_register(). Registering the client and
    receiving events are serialized by struct drm_device.clientlist_mutex.
    So an output is either configured by the initial hotplug event, or
    the client has already been registered.
    
    The bug was originally added in commit 6e3f17ee73f7 ("drm/fb-helper:
    generic: Call drm_client_add() after setup is done"), in which adding
    a client and receiving a hotplug event switched order. It was hidden,
    as most hardware and drivers have at least on static output configured.
    Other drivers didn't use the internal DRM client or still had struct
    drm_mode_config_funcs.output_poll_changed set. That callback handled
    hotplug events as well. After not setting the callback in amdgpu in
    commit 0e3172bac3f4 ("drm/amdgpu: Don't set struct
    drm_driver.output_poll_changed"), amdgpu did not show a framebuffer
    console if output events got lost. The bug got copy-pasted from
    fbdev-generic into the other fbdev emulation.

    smb: client: fix parsing of source mount option
    
    commit 49024ec8795ed2bd7217c249ef50a70c4e25d662 upstream.
    
    Handle trailing and leading separators when parsing UNC and prefix
    paths in smb3_parse_devname().  Then, store the sanitised paths in
    smb3_fs_context::source.
    
    This fixes the following cases
    
    $ mount //srv/share// /mnt/1 -o ...
    $ cat /mnt/1/d0/f0
    cat: /mnt/1/d0/f0: Invalid argument
    
    The -EINVAL was returned because the client sent SMB2_CREATE "\\d0\f0"
    rather than SMB2_CREATE "\d0\f0".
    
    $ mount //srv//share /mnt/1 -o ...
    mount: Invalid argument
    
    The -EINVAL was returned correctly although the client only realised
    it after sending a couple of bad requests rather than bailing out
    earlier when parsing mount options.

    net/sched: sch_qfq: account for stab overhead in qfq_enqueue
    
    [ Upstream commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64 ]
    
    Lion says:
    -------
    In the QFQ scheduler a similar issue to CVE-2023-31436
    persists.
    
    Consider the following code in net/sched/sch_qfq.c:
    
    static int qfq_enqueue(struct sk_buff *skb, struct Qdisc *sch,
                    struct sk_buff **to_free)
    {
         unsigned int len = qdisc_pkt_len(skb), gso_segs;
    
        // ...
    
         if (unlikely(cl->agg->lmax < len)) {
             pr_debug("qfq: increasing maxpkt from %u to %u for class %u",
                  cl->agg->lmax, len, cl->common.classid);
             err = qfq_change_agg(sch, cl, cl->agg->class_weight, len);
             if (err) {
                 cl->qstats.drops++;
                 return qdisc_drop(skb, sch, to_free);
             }
    
        // ...
    
         }
    
    Similarly to CVE-2023-31436, "lmax" is increased without any bounds
    checks according to the packet length "len". Usually this would not
    impose a problem because packet sizes are naturally limited.
    
    This is however not the actual packet length, rather the
    "qdisc_pkt_len(skb)" which might apply size transformations according to
    "struct qdisc_size_table" as created by "qdisc_get_stab()" in
    net/sched/sch_api.c if the TCA_STAB option was set when modifying the qdisc.
    
    A user may choose virtually any size using such a table.
    
    As a result the same issue as in CVE-2023-31436 can occur, allowing heap
    out-of-bounds read / writes in the kmalloc-8192 cache.
    -------
    
    We can create the issue with the following commands:
    
    tc qdisc add dev $DEV root handle 1: stab mtu 2048 tsize 512 mpu 0 \
    overhead 999999999 linklayer ethernet qfq
    tc class add dev $DEV parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 6mbit burst 15k

    25369891fcef deletes a check for the case where no 'lmax' is
    specified which 3037933448f6 previously fixed as 'lmax'
    could be set to the device's MTU without any bound checking
    for QFQ_LMAX_MIN and QFQ_LMAX_MAX. Therefore, reintroduce the check.

    [ Upstream commit f72207a5c0dbaaf6921cf9a6c0d2fd0bc249ea78 ]
    
    The simple_write_to_buffer() function is designed to handle partial
    writes.  It returns negatives on error, otherwise it returns the number
    of bytes that were able to be copied.  This code doesn't check the
    return properly.  We only know that the first byte is written, the rest
    of the buffer might be uninitialized.
    
    There is no need to use the simple_write_to_buffer() function.
    Partial writes are prohibited by the "if (*ppos != 0)" check at the
    start of the function.  Just use memdup_user() and copy the whole
    buffer.

    net/sched: flower: Ensure both minimum and maximum ports are specified
    
    [ Upstream commit d3f87278bcb80bd7f9519669d928b43320363d4f ]
    
    The kernel does not currently validate that both the minimum and maximum
    ports of a port range are specified. This can lead user space to think
    that a filter matching on a port range was successfully added, when in
    fact it was not. For example, with a patched (buggy) iproute2 that only
    sends the minimum port, the following commands do not return an error:
    
     # tc filter add dev swp1 ingress pref 1 proto ip flower ip_proto udp src_port 100-200 action pass
    
     # tc filter add dev swp1 ingress pref 1 proto ip flower ip_proto udp dst_port 100-200 action pass
    
     # tc filter show dev swp1 ingress
     filter protocol ip pref 1 flower chain 0
     filter protocol ip pref 1 flower chain 0 handle 0x1
       eth_type ipv4
       ip_proto udp
       not_in_hw
             action order 1: gact action pass
              random type none pass val 0
              index 1 ref 1 bind 1
    
     filter protocol ip pref 1 flower chain 0 handle 0x2
       eth_type ipv4
       ip_proto udp
       not_in_hw
             action order 1: gact action pass
              random type none pass val 0
              index 2 ref 1 bind 1
    
    Fix by returning an error unless both ports are specified:
    
     # tc filter add dev swp1 ingress pref 1 proto ip flower ip_proto udp src_port 100-200 action pass
     Error: Both min and max source ports must be specified.
     We have an error talking to the kernel

    [ Upstream commit 2e06c57d66d3f6c26faa5f5b479fb3add34ce85a ]
    
    Currently, verifier does not reject XDP programs that pass NULL pointer to
    hints functions. At the same time, this case is not handled in any driver
    implementation (including veth). For example, changing
    
    bpf_xdp_metadata_rx_timestamp(ctx, &timestamp);
    
    to
    
    bpf_xdp_metadata_rx_timestamp(ctx, NULL);
    
    in xdp_metadata test successfully crashes the system.
    
    Add KF_TRUSTED_ARGS flag to hints kfunc definitions, so driver code
    does not have to worry about getting invalid pointers.

    erofs: avoid infinite loop in z_erofs_do_read_page() when reading beyond EOF
    
    [ Upstream commit 8191213a5835b0317c5e4d0d337ae1ae00c75253 ]
    
    z_erofs_do_read_page() may loop infinitely due to the inappropriate
    truncation in the below statement. Since the offset is 64 bits and min_t()
    truncates the result to 32 bits. The solution is to replace unsigned int
    with a 64-bit type, such as erofs_off_t.
        cur = end - min_t(unsigned int, offset + end - map->m_la, end);
    
        - For example:
            - offset = 0x400160000
            - end = 0x370
            - map->m_la = 0x160370
            - offset + end - map->m_la = 0x400000000
            - offset + end - map->m_la = 0x00000000 (truncated as unsigned int)
        - Expected result:
            - cur = 0
        - Actual result:
            - cur = 0x370

    net: fec: increase the size of tx ring and update tx_wake_threshold
    
    [ Upstream commit 56b3c6ba53d0e9649ea5e4089b39cadde13aaef8 ]
    
    When the XDP feature is enabled and with heavy XDP frames to be
    transmitted, there is a considerable probability that available
    tx BDs are insufficient. This will lead to some XDP frames to be
    discarded and the "NOT enough BD for SG!" error log will appear
    in the console (as shown below).
    
    [  160.013112] fec 30be0000.ethernet eth0: NOT enough BD for SG!
    [  160.023116] fec 30be0000.ethernet eth0: NOT enough BD for SG!
    [  160.028926] fec 30be0000.ethernet eth0: NOT enough BD for SG!
    [  160.038946] fec 30be0000.ethernet eth0: NOT enough BD for SG!
    [  160.044758] fec 30be0000.ethernet eth0: NOT enough BD for SG!
    
    In the case of heavy XDP traffic, sometimes the speed of recycling
    tx BDs may be slower than the speed of sending XDP frames. There
    may be several specific reasons, such as the interrupt is not
    responsed in time, the efficiency of the NAPI callback function is
    too low due to all the queues (tx queues and rx queues) share the
    same NAPI, and so on.
    
    After trying various methods, I think that increase the size of tx
    BD ring is simple and effective. Maybe the best resolution is that
    allocate NAPI for each queue to improve the efficiency of the NAPI
    callback, but this change is a bit big and I didn't try this method.
    Perheps this method will be implemented in a future patch.
    
    This patch also updates the tx_wake_threshold of tx ring which is
    related to the size of tx ring in the previous logic. Otherwise,
    the tx_wake_threshold will be too high (403 BDs), which is more
    likely to impact the slow path in the case of heavy XDP traffic,
    because XDP path and slow path share the tx BD rings. According
    to Jakub's suggestion, the tx_wake_threshold is at least equal to
    tx_stop_threshold + 2 * MAX_SKB_FRAGS, if a queue of hundreds of
    entries is overflowing, we should be able to apply a hysteresis
    of a few tens of entries.

    [ Upstream commit 20f797399035a8052dbd7297fdbe094079a9482e ]
    
    Once the XDP frames have been successfully transmitted through the
    ndo_xdp_xmit() interface, it's the driver responsibility to free
    the frames so that the page_pool can recycle the pages and reuse
    them. However, this action is not implemented in the fec driver.
    This leads to a user-visible problem that the console will print
    the following warning log.
    
    [  157.568851] page_pool_release_retry() stalled pool shutdown 1389 inflight 60 sec
    [  217.983446] page_pool_release_retry() stalled pool shutdown 1389 inflight 120 sec

    [  399.226946] page_pool_release_retry() stalled pool shutdown 1389 inflight 302 sec
    
    Therefore, to solve this issue, we free XDP frames via xdp_return_frame()
    while cleaning the tx BD ring.

    riscv, bpf: Fix inconsistent JIT image generation
    
    [ Upstream commit c56fb2aab23505bb7160d06097c8de100b82b851 ]
    
    In order to generate the prologue and epilogue, the BPF JIT needs to
    know which registers that are clobbered. Therefore, the during
    pre-final passes, the prologue is generated after the body of the
    program body-prologue-epilogue. Then, in the final pass, a proper
    prologue-body-epilogue JITted image is generated.
    
    This scheme has worked most of the time. However, for some large
    programs with many jumps, e.g. the test_kmod.sh BPF selftest with
    hardening enabled (blinding constants), this has shown to be
    incorrect. For the final pass, when the proper prologue-body-epilogue
    is generated, the image has not converged. This will lead to that the
    final image will have incorrect jump offsets. The following is an
    excerpt from an incorrect image:
    
      | ...
      |     3b8:       00c50663                beq     a0,a2,3c4 <.text+0x3c4>
      |     3bc:       0020e317                auipc   t1,0x20e
      |     3c0:       49630067                jalr    zero,1174(t1) # 20e852 <.text+0x20e852>
      | ...
      |  20e84c:       8796                    c.mv    a5,t0
      |  20e84e:       6422                    c.ldsp  s0,8(sp)    # Epilogue start
      |  20e850:       6141                    c.addi16sp      sp,16
      |  20e852:       853e                    c.mv    a0,a5       # Incorrect jump target
      |  20e854:       8082                    c.jr    ra
    
    The image has shrunk, and the epilogue offset is incorrect in the
    final pass.
    
    Correct the problem by always generating proper prologue-body-epilogue
    outputs, which means that the first pass will only generate the body
    to track what registers that are touched.

    openrisc: Union fpcsr and oldmask in sigcontext to unbreak userspace ABI
    
    [ Upstream commit dceaafd668812115037fc13a1893d068b7b880f5 ]
    
    With commit 27267655c531 ("openrisc: Support floating point user api") I
    added an entry to the struct sigcontext which caused an unwanted change
    to the userspace ABI.
    
    To fix this we use the previously unused oldmask field space for the
    floating point fpcsr state.  We do this with a union to restore the ABI
    back to the pre kernel v6.4 ABI and keep API compatibility.
    
    This does mean if there is some code somewhere that is setting oldmask
    in an OpenRISC specific userspace sighandler it would end up setting the
    floating point register status, but I think it's unlikely as oldmask was
    never functional before.

    igc: Fix inserting of empty frame for launchtime
    
    [ Upstream commit 0bcc62858d6ba62cbade957d69745e6adeed5f3d ]
    
    The insertion of an empty frame was introduced with
    commit db0b124f02ba ("igc: Enhance Qbv scheduling by using first flag bit")
    in order to ensure that the current cycle has at least one packet if
    there is some packet to be scheduled for the next cycle.
    
    However, the current implementation does not properly check if
    a packet is already scheduled for the current cycle. Currently,
    an empty packet is always inserted if and only if
    txtime >= end_of_cycle && txtime > last_tx_cycle
    but since last_tx_cycle is always either the end of the current
    cycle (end_of_cycle) or the end of a previous cycle, the
    second part (txtime > last_tx_cycle) is always true unless
    txtime == last_tx_cycle.
    
    What actually needs to be checked here is if the last_tx_cycle
    was already written within the current cycle, so an empty frame
    should only be inserted if and only if
    txtime >= end_of_cycle && end_of_cycle > last_tx_cycle.
    
    This patch does not only avoid an unnecessary insertion, but it
    can actually be harmful to insert an empty packet if packets
    are already scheduled in the current cycle, because it can lead
    to a situation where the empty packet is actually processed
    as the first packet in the upcoming cycle shifting the packet
    with the first_flag even one cycle into the future, finally leading
    to a TX hang.
    
    The TX hang can be reproduced on a i225 with:
    
        sudo tc qdisc replace dev enp1s0 parent root handle 100 taprio \
                num_tc 1 \

    igc: Fix launchtime before start of cycle
    
    [ Upstream commit c1bca9ac0bcb355be11354c2e68bc7bf31f5ac5a ]
    
    It is possible (verified on a running system) that frames are processed
    by igc_tx_launchtime with a txtime before the start of the cycle
    (baset_est).
    
    However, the result of txtime - baset_est is written into a u32,
    leading to a wrap around to a positive number. The following
    launchtime > 0 check will only branch to executing launchtime = 0
    if launchtime is already 0.
    
    Fix it by using a s32 before checking launchtime > 0.

    igc: No strict mode in pure launchtime/CBS offload
    
    [ Upstream commit 8b86f10ab64eca0287ea8f7c94e9ad8b2e101c01 ]
    
    The flags IGC_TXQCTL_STRICT_CYCLE and IGC_TXQCTL_STRICT_END
    prevent the packet transmission over slot and cycle boundaries.
    This is important for taprio offload where the slots and
    cycles correspond to the slots and cycles configured for the
    network.
    
    However, the Qbv offload feature of the i225 is also used for
    enabling TX launchtime / ETF offload. In that case, however,
    the cycle has no meaning for the network and is only used
    internally to adapt the base time register after a second has
    passed.
    
    Enabling strict mode in this case would unnecessarily prevent
    the transmission of certain packets (i.e. at the boundary of a
    second) and thus interferes with the ETF qdisc that promises
    transmission at a certain point in time.
    
    Similar to ETF, this also applies to CBS offload that also should
    not be influenced by strict mode unless taprio offload would be
    enabled at the same time.
    
    This fully reverts
    commit d8f45be01dd9 ("igc: Use strict cycles for Qbv scheduling")
    but its commit message only describes what was already implemented
    before that commit. The difference to a plain revert of that commit
    is that it now copes with the base_time = 0 case that was fixed with
    commit e17090eb2494 ("igc: allow BaseTime 0 enrollment for Qbv")
    
    In particular, enabling strict mode leads to TX hang situations
    under high traffic if taprio is applied WITHOUT taprio offload
    but WITH ETF offload, e.g. as in
    
        sudo tc qdisc replace dev enp1s0 parent root handle 100 taprio \
                num_tc 1 \
                map 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \
                queues 1@0 \
                base-time 0 \
                sched-entry S 01 300000 \
                flags 0x1 \
                txtime-delay 500000 \
                clockid CLOCK_TAI
        sudo tc qdisc replace dev enp1s0 parent 100:1 etf \
                clockid CLOCK_TAI \
                delta 500000 \
                offload \

    igc: Handle already enabled taprio offload for basetime 0
    
    [ Upstream commit e5d88c53d03f8df864776431175d08c053645f50 ]
    
    Since commit e17090eb2494 ("igc: allow BaseTime 0 enrollment for Qbv")
    it is possible to enable taprio offload with a basetime of 0.
    However, the check if taprio offload is already enabled (and thus -EALREADY
    should be returned for igc_save_qbv_schedule) still relied on
    adapter->base_time > 0.
    
    This can be reproduced as follows:
    
        # TAPRIO offload (flags == 0x2) and base-time = 0
        sudo tc qdisc replace dev enp1s0 parent root handle 100 stab overhead 24 taprio \

        # The second call should fail with "Error: Device failed to setup taprio offload."
        # But that only happens if base-time was != 0

    igc: Do not enable taprio offload for invalid arguments
    
    [ Upstream commit 82ff5f29b7377d614f0c01fd74b5d0cb225f0adc ]
    
    Only set adapter->taprio_offload_enable after validating the arguments.
    Otherwise, it stays set even if the offload was not enabled.
    Since the subsequent code does not get executed in case of invalid
    arguments, it will not be read at first.
    However, by activating and then deactivating another offload
    (e.g. ETF/TX launchtime offload), taprio_offload_enable is read
    and erroneously keeps the offload feature of the NIC enabled.
    
    This can be reproduced as follows:
    
        # TAPRIO offload (flags == 0x2) and negative base-time leading to expected -ERANGE
        sudo tc qdisc replace dev enp1s0 parent root handle 100 stab overhead 24 taprio \

    igc: Rename qbv_enable to taprio_offload_enable
    
    [ Upstream commit 8046063df887bee35c002224267ba46f41be7cf6 ]
    
    In the current implementation the flags adapter->qbv_enable
    and IGC_FLAG_TSN_QBV_ENABLED have a similar name, but do not
    have the same meaning. The first one is used only to indicate
    taprio offload (i.e. when igc_save_qbv_schedule was called),
    while the second one corresponds to the Qbv mode of the hardware.
    However, the second one is also used to support the TX launchtime
    feature, i.e. ETF qdisc offload. This leads to situations where
    adapter->qbv_enable is false, but the flag IGC_FLAG_TSN_QBV_ENABLED
    is set. This is prone to confusion.
    
    The rename should reduce this confusion. Since it is a pure
    rename, it has no impact on functionality.

    net/sched: taprio: replace tc_taprio_qopt_offload :: enable with a "cmd" enum
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d800bc500fb3fb07a0fb42e2d0a1356fb9e1e8f ]
    
    Inspired from struct flow_cls_offload :: cmd, in order for taprio to be
    able to report statistics (which is future work), it seems that we need
    to drill one step further with the ndo_setup_tc(TC_SETUP_QDISC_TAPRIO)
    multiplexing, and pass the command as part of the common portion of the
    muxed structure.
    
    Since we already have an "enable" variable in tc_taprio_qopt_offload,
    refactor all drivers to check for "cmd" instead of "enable", and reject
    every other command except "replace" and "destroy" - to be future proof.

    platform/x86: wmi: Break possible infinite loop when parsing GUID
    
    [ Upstream commit 028e6e204ace1f080cfeacd72c50397eb8ae8883 ]
    
    The while-loop may break on one of the two conditions, either ID string
    is empty or GUID matches. The second one, may never be reached if the
    parsed string is not correct GUID. In such a case the loop will never
    advance to check the next ID.
    
    Break possible infinite loop by factoring out guid_parse_and_compare()
    helper which may be moved to the generic header for everyone later on
    and preventing from similar mistake in the future.
    
    Interestingly that firstly it appeared when WMI was turned into a bus
    driver, but later when duplicated GUIDs were checked, the while-loop
    has been replaced by for-loop and hence no mistake made again.

    HID: hyperv: avoid struct memcpy overrun warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f151364b1da6bd217632fd4ee8cc24eaf66a497 ]
    
    A previous patch addressed the fortified memcpy warning for most
    builds, but I still see this one with gcc-9:
    
    In file included from include/linux/string.h:254,
                     from drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:8:
    In function 'fortify_memcpy_chk',
        inlined from 'mousevsc_on_receive' at drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:272:3:

      583 |    __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);
          |    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    My guess is that the WARN_ON() itself is what confuses gcc, so it no
    longer sees that there is a correct range check. Rework the code in a
    way that helps readability and avoids the warning.

    ipv6/addrconf: fix a potential refcount underflow for idev
    
    [ Upstream commit 06a0716949c22e2aefb648526580671197151acc ]
    
    Now in addrconf_mod_rs_timer(), reference idev depends on whether
    rs_timer is not pending. Then modify rs_timer timeout.
    
    There is a time gap in [1], during which if the pending rs_timer
    becomes not pending. It will miss to hold idev, but the rs_timer
    is activated. Thus rs_timer callback function addrconf_rs_timer()
    will be executed and put idev later without holding idev. A refcount
    underflow issue for idev can be caused by this.
    
            if (!timer_pending(&idev->rs_timer))
                    in6_dev_hold(idev);
                      <--------------[1]
            mod_timer(&idev->rs_timer, jiffies + when);
    
    To fix the issue, hold idev if mod_timer() return 0.

    icmp6: Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().
    
    [ Upstream commit 2aaa8a15de73874847d62eb595c6683bface80fd ]
    
    With some IPv6 Ext Hdr (RPL, SRv6, etc.), we can send a packet that
    has the link-local address as src and dst IP and will be forwarded to
    an external IP in the IPv6 Ext Hdr.
    
    For example, the script below generates a packet whose src IP is the
    link-local address and dst is updated to 11::.
    
      # for f in $(find /proc/sys/net/ -name *seg6_enabled*); do echo 1 > $f; done
      # python3
      >>> from socket import *
      >>> from scapy.all import *
      >>>
      >>> SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR = "fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456"
      >>>
      >>> pkt = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR)
      >>> pkt /= IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=4, addresses=["11::", "22::"], segleft=1)
      >>>
      >>> sk = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)
      >>> sk.sendto(bytes(pkt), (DST_ADDR, 0))
    
    For such a packet, we call ip6_route_input() to look up a route for the
    next destination in these three functions depending on the header type.
    
      * ipv6_rthdr_rcv()
      * ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv()
      * ipv6_srh_rcv()
    
    If no route is found, ip6_null_entry is set to skb, and the following
    dst_input(skb) calls ip6_pkt_drop().
    
    Finally, in icmp6_dev(), we dereference skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev->dev
    as the input device is the loopback interface.  Then, we have to check if
    skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev is NULL or not to avoid NULL pointer deref
    for ip6_null_entry.

    s390/ism: Do not unregister clients with registered DMBs
    
    [ Upstream commit 266deeea34ffd28c6b6a63edf2af9b5a07161c24 ]
    
    When ism_unregister_client() is called but the client still has DMBs
    registered it returns -EBUSY and prints an error. This only happens
    after the client has already been unregistered however. This is
    unexpected as the unregister claims to have failed. Furthermore as this
    implies a client bug a WARN() is more appropriate. Thus move the
    deregistration after the check and use WARN().

    s390/ism: Fix and simplify add()/remove() callback handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 76631ffa2fd2d45bae5ad717eef716b94144e0e7 ]
    
    Previously the clients_lock was protecting the clients array against
    concurrent addition/removal of clients but was also accessed from IRQ
    context. This meant that it had to be a spinlock and that the add() and
    remove() callbacks in which clients need to do allocation and take
    mutexes can't be called under the clients_lock. To work around this these
    callbacks were moved to workqueues. This not only introduced significant
    complexity but is also subtly broken in at least one way.
    
    In ism_dev_init() and ism_dev_exit() clients[i]->tgt_ism is used to
    communicate the added/removed ISM device to the work function. While
    write access to client[i]->tgt_ism is protected by the clients_lock and
    the code waits that there is no pending add/remove work before and after
    setting clients[i]->tgt_ism this is not enough. The problem is that the
    wait happens based on per ISM device counters. Thus a concurrent
    ism_dev_init()/ism_dev_exit() for a different ISM device may overwrite
    a clients[i]->tgt_ism between unlocking the clients_lock and the
    subsequent wait for the work to finnish.
    
    Thankfully with the clients_lock no longer held in IRQ context it can be
    turned into a mutex which can be held during the calls to add()/remove()
    completely removing the need for the workqueues and the associated
    broken housekeeping including the per ISM device counters and the
    clients[i]->tgt_ism.

    s390/ism: Fix locking for forwarding of IRQs and events to clients
    
    [ Upstream commit 6b5c13b591d753c6022fbd12f8c0c0a9a07fc065 ]
    
    The clients array references all registered clients and is protected by
    the clients_lock. Besides its use as general list of clients the clients
    array is accessed in ism_handle_irq() to forward ISM device events to
    clients.
    
    While the clients_lock is taken in the IRQ handler when calling
    handle_event() it is however incorrectly not held during the
    client->handle_irq() call and for the preceding clients[] access leaving
    it unprotected against concurrent client (un-)registration.
    
    Furthermore the accesses to ism->sba_client_arr[] in ism_register_dmb()
    and ism_unregister_dmb() are not protected by any lock. This is
    especially problematic as the client ID from the ism->sba_client_arr[]
    is not checked against NO_CLIENT and neither is the client pointer
    checked.
    
    Instead of expanding the use of the clients_lock further add a separate
    array in struct ism_dev which references clients subscribed to the
    device's events and IRQs. This array is protected by ism->lock which is
    already taken in ism_handle_irq() and can be taken outside the IRQ
    handler when adding/removing subscribers or the accessing
    ism->sba_client_arr[]. This also means that the clients_lock is no
    longer taken in IRQ context.

    In the critical scenario, rx-gro-list GRO-ed packets are fed, via a
    bridge, both to the local input path and to an egress device (tun).
    
    The segmentation of such packets unsafely writes to the cloned skbs
    with shared heads.
    
    This change addresses the issue by uncloning as needed the
    to-be-segmented skbs.

    net: bgmac: postpone turning IRQs off to avoid SoC hangs
    
    [ Upstream commit e7731194fdf085f46d58b1adccfddbd0dfee4873 ]
    
    Turning IRQs off is done by accessing Ethernet controller registers.
    That can't be done until device's clock is enabled. It results in a SoC
    hang otherwise.
    
    This bug remained unnoticed for years as most bootloaders keep all
    Ethernet interfaces turned on. It seems to only affect a niche SoC
    family BCM47189. It has two Ethernet controllers but CFE bootloader uses
    only the first one.

    net: mscc: ocelot: fix oversize frame dropping for preemptible TCs
    
    [ Upstream commit c6efb4ae387c79bf0d4da286108c810b7b40de3c ]
    
    This switch implements Hold/Release in a strange way, with no control
    from the user as required by IEEE 802.1Q-2018 through Set-And-Hold-MAC
    and Set-And-Release-MAC, but rather, it emits HOLD requests implicitly
    based on the schedule.
    
    Namely, when the gate of a preemptible TC is about to close (actually
    QSYS::PREEMPTION_CFG.HOLD_ADVANCE octet times in advance of this event),
    the QSYS seems to emit a HOLD request pulse towards the MAC which
    preempts the currently transmitted packet, and further packets are held
    back in the queue system.
    
    This allows large frames to be squeezed through small time slots,
    because HOLD requests initiated by the gate events result in the frame
    being segmented in multiple fragments, the bit time of which is equal to
    the size of the time slot.
    
    It has been reported that the vsc9959_tas_guard_bands_update() logic
    breaks this, because it doesn't take preemptible TCs into account, and
    enables oversized frame dropping when the time slot doesn't allow a full
    MTU to be sent, but it does allow 2*minFragSize to be sent (128B).
    Packets larger than 128B are dropped instead of being sent in multiple
    fragments.
    
    Confusingly, the manual says:
    
    | For guard band, SDU calculation of a traffic class of a port, if
    | preemption is enabled (through 'QSYS::PREEMPTION_CFG.P_QUEUES') then
    | QSYS::PREEMPTION_CFG.HOLD_ADVANCE is used, otherwise
    | QSYS::QMAXSDU_CFG_*.QMAXSDU_* is used.
    
    but this only refers to the static guard band durations, and the
    QMAXSDU_CFG_* registers have dual purpose - the other being oversized
    frame dropping, which takes place irrespective of whether frames are
    preemptible or express.
    
    So, to fix the problem, we need to call vsc9959_tas_guard_bands_update()
    from ocelot_port_update_active_preemptible_tcs(), and modify the guard
    band logic to consider a different (lower) oversize limit for
    preemptible traffic classes.

    bpf: Fix max stack depth check for async callbacks
    
    [ Upstream commit 5415ccd50a8620c8cbaa32d6f18c946c453566f5 ]
    
    The check_max_stack_depth pass happens after the verifier's symbolic
    execution, and attempts to walk the call graph of the BPF program,
    ensuring that the stack usage stays within bounds for all possible call
    chains. There are two cases to consider: bpf_pseudo_func and
    bpf_pseudo_call. In the former case, the callback pointer is loaded into
    a register, and is assumed that it is passed to some helper later which
    calls it (however there is no way to be sure), but the check remains
    conservative and accounts the stack usage anyway. For this particular
    case, asynchronous callbacks are skipped as they execute asynchronously
    when their corresponding event fires.
    
    The case of bpf_pseudo_call is simpler and we know that the call is
    definitely made, hence the stack depth of the subprog is accounted for.
    
    However, the current check still skips an asynchronous callback even if
    a bpf_pseudo_call was made for it. This is erroneous, as it will miss
    accounting for the stack usage of the asynchronous callback, which can
    be used to breach the maximum stack depth limit.
    
    Fix this by only skipping asynchronous callbacks when the instruction is
    not a pseudo call to the subprog.

    blk-crypto: use dynamic lock class for blk_crypto_profile::lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 2fb48d88e77f29bf9d278f25bcfe82cf59a0e09b ]
    
    When a device-mapper device is passing through the inline encryption
    support of an underlying device, calls to blk_crypto_evict_key() take
    the blk_crypto_profile::lock of the device-mapper device, then take the
    blk_crypto_profile::lock of the underlying device (nested).  This isn't
    a real deadlock, but it causes a lockdep report because there is only
    one lock class for all instances of this lock.
    
    Lockdep subclasses don't really work here because the hierarchy of block
    devices is dynamic and could have more than 2 levels.
    
    Instead, register a dynamic lock class for each blk_crypto_profile, and
    associate that with the lock.
    
    This avoids false-positive lockdep reports like the following:

    igc: Handle PPS start time programming for past time values
    
    [ Upstream commit 84a192e46106355de1a314d709e657231d4b1026 ]
    
    I225/6 hardware can be programmed to start PPS output once
    the time in Target Time registers is reached. The time
    programmed in these registers should always be into future.
    Only then PPS output is triggered when SYSTIM register
    reaches the programmed value. There are two modes in i225/6
    hardware to program PPS, pulse and clock mode.
    
    There were issues reported where PPS is not generated when
    start time is in past.
    
    Example 1, "echo 0 0 0 2 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp0/period"
    
    In the current implementation, a value of '0' is programmed
    into Target time registers and PPS output is in pulse mode.
    Eventually an interrupt which is triggered upon SYSTIM
    register reaching Target time is not fired. Thus no PPS
    output is generated.
    
    Example 2, "echo 0 0 0 1 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp0/period"
    
    Above case, a value of '0' is programmed into Target time
    registers and PPS output is in clock mode. Here, HW tries to
    catch-up the current time by incrementing Target Time
    register. This catch-up time seem to vary according to
    programmed PPS period time as per the HW design. In my
    experiments, the delay ranged between few tens of seconds to
    few minutes. The PPS output is only generated after the
    Target time register reaches current time.
    
    In my experiments, I also observed PPS stopped working with
    below test and could not recover until module is removed and
    loaded again.
    
    1) echo 0 <future time> 0 1 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/period
    2) echo 0 0 0 1 0 > /sys/class/ptp/ptp1/period

    igc: Include the length/type field and VLAN tag in queueMaxSDU
    
    [ Upstream commit 25102893e409bc02761ab82dbcfa092006404790 ]
    
    IEEE 802.1Q does not have clear definitions of what constitutes an
    SDU (Service Data Unit), but IEEE Std 802.3 clause 3.1.2 does define
    the MAC service primitives and clause 3.2.7 does define the MAC Client
    Data for Q-tagged frames.
    
    It shows that the mac_service_data_unit (MSDU) does NOT contain the
    preamble, destination and source address, or FCS. The MSDU does contain
    the length/type field, MAC client data, VLAN tag and any padding
    data (prior to the FCS).
    
    Thus, the maximum 802.3 frame size that is allowed to be transmitted
    should be QueueMaxSDU (MSDU) + 16 (6 byte SA + 6 byte DA + 4 byte FCS).

    net/mlx5e: RX, Fix page_pool page fragment tracking for XDP
    
    [ Upstream commit 7abd955a58fb0fcd4e756fa2065c03ae488fcfa7 ]
    
    Currently mlx5e releases pages directly to the page_pool for XDP_TX and
    does page fragment counting for XDP_REDIRECT. RX pages from the
    page_pool are leaking on XDP_REDIRECT because the xdp core will release
    only one fragment out of MLX5E_PAGECNT_BIAS_MAX and subsequently the page
    is marked as "skip release" which avoids the driver release.
    
    A fix would be to take an extra fragment for XDP_REDIRECT and not set the
    "skip release" bit so that the release on the driver side can handle the
    remaining bias fragments. But this would be a shortsighted solution.
    Instead, this patch converges the two XDP paths (XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT) to
    always do fragment tracking. The "skip release" bit is no longer
    necessary for XDP.

    On vport enable, where fw's hca caps are queried, the driver queries
    hca_caps_2 without checking if fw truly supports them, causing a false
    failure of vfs vport load and blocking SRIOV enablement on old devices
    such as CX4 where hca_caps_2 support is missing.
    
    Thus, add a check for the said caps support before accessing them.

    [ Upstream commit f7a485115ad4cfc560833942014bf791abf1f827 ]
    
    Non-clear CT action causes a flow rule split, while CT clear action
    doesn't and is just a header-rewrite to the current flow rule.
    But ct offload is done in post_parse and is per ct action instance,
    so ct clear offload is parsed multiple times, while its deleted once.
    
    Fix this by post_parsing the ct action only once per flow attribute
    (which is per flow rule) by using a offloaded ct_attr flag.

    net/mlx5e: Check for NOT_READY flag state after locking
    
    [ Upstream commit 65e64640e97c0f223e77f9ea69b5a46186b93470 ]
    
    Currently the check for NOT_READY flag is performed before obtaining the
    necessary lock. This opens a possibility for race condition when the flow
    is concurrently removed from unready_flows list by the workqueue task,
    which causes a double-removal from the list and a crash[0]. Fix the issue
    by moving the flag check inside the section protected by
    uplink_priv->unready_flows_lock mutex.

    net/mlx5: Register a unique thermal zone per device
    
    [ Upstream commit 631079e08aa4a20b73e70de4cf457886194f029f ]
    
    Prior to this patch only one "mlx5" thermal zone could have been
    registered regardless of the number of individual mlx5 devices in the
    system.
    
    To fix this setup a unique name per device to register its own thermal
    zone.
    
    In order to not register a thermal zone for a virtual device (VF/SF) add
    a check for PF device type.
    
    The new name is a concatenation between "mlx5_" and "<PCI_DEV_BDF>", which
    will also help associating a thermal zone with its PCI device.

    net/mlx5e: RX, Fix flush and close release flow of regular rq for legacy rq
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e2d1965794d22fbe86df45bf4f933216743577d ]
    
    Regular (non-XSK) RQs get flushed on XSK setup and re-activated on XSK
    close. If the same regular RQ is closed (a config change for example)
    soon after the XSK close, a double release occurs because the missing
    wqes get released a second time.

    igc: Fix TX Hang issue when QBV Gate is closed
    
    [ Upstream commit 175c241288c09f81eb7b44d65c1ef6045efa4d1a ]
    
    If a user schedules a Gate Control List (GCL) to close one of
    the QBV gates while also transmitting a packet to that closed gate,
    TX Hang will be happen. HW would not drop any packet when the gate
    is closed and keep queuing up in HW TX FIFO until the gate is re-opened.
    This patch implements the solution to drop the packet for the closed
    gate.
    
    This patch will also reset the adapter to perform SW initialization
    for each 1st Gate Control List (GCL) to avoid hang.
    This is due to the HW design, where changing to TSN transmit mode
    requires SW initialization. Intel Discrete I225/6 transmit mode
    cannot be changed when in dynamic mode according to Software User
    Manual Section 7.5.2.1. Subsequent Gate Control List (GCL) operations
    will proceed without a reset, as they already are in TSN Mode.
    
    Step to reproduce:
    
    DUT:
    1) Configure GCL List with certain gate close.
    
    BASE=$(date +%s%N)
    tc qdisc replace dev $IFACE parent root handle 100 taprio \
        num_tc 4 \
        map 0 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 \
        queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 \
        base-time $BASE \
        sched-entry S 0x8 500000 \
        sched-entry S 0x4 500000 \
        flags 0x2
    
    2) Transmit the packet to closed gate. You may use udp_tai
    application to transmit UDP packet to any of the closed gate.
    
    ./udp_tai -i <interface> -P 100000 -p 90 -c 1 -t <0/1> -u 30004

    igc: Add XDP hints kfuncs for RX hash
    
    [ Upstream commit 8416814fffa9cfa74c18da149f522dd9e1850987 ]
    
    This implements XDP hints kfunc for RX-hash (xmo_rx_hash).
    The HW rss hash type is handled via mapping table.
    
    This igc driver (default config) does L3 hashing for UDP packets
    (excludes UDP src/dest ports in hash calc).  Meaning RSS hash type is
    L3 based.  Tested that the igc_rss_type_num for UDP is either
    IGC_RSS_TYPE_HASH_IPV4 or IGC_RSS_TYPE_HASH_IPV6.
    
    This patch also updates AF_XDP zero-copy function igc_clean_rx_irq_zc()
    to use the xdp_buff wrapper struct igc_xdp_buff.

    [ Upstream commit 73b7123de0cfa4f6609677e927ab02cb05b593c2 ]
    
    Driver specific metadata data for XDP-hints kfuncs are propagated via tail
    extending the struct xdp_buff with a locally scoped driver struct.
    
    Zero-Copy AF_XDP/XSK does similar tricks via struct xdp_buff_xsk. This
    xdp_buff_xsk struct contains a CB area (24 bytes) that can be used for
    extending the locally scoped driver into. The XSK_CHECK_PRIV_TYPE define
    catch size violations build time.
    
    The changes needed for AF_XDP zero-copy in igc_clean_rx_irq_zc()
    is done in next patch, because the member rx_desc isn't available
    at this point.

    igc: Remove delay during TX ring configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit cca28ceac7c7857bc2d313777017585aef00bcc4 ]
    
    Remove unnecessary delay during the TX ring configuration.
    This will cause delay, especially during link down and
    link up activity.
    
    Furthermore, old SKUs like as I225 will call the reset_adapter
    to reset the controller during TSN mode Gate Control List (GCL)
    setting. This will add more time to the configuration of the
    real-time use case.
    
    It doesn't mentioned about this delay in the Software User Manual.
    It might have been ported from legacy code I210 in the past.

    netfilter: conntrack: don't fold port numbers into addresses before hashing
    
    [ Upstream commit eaf9e7192ec9af2fbf1b6eb2299dd0feca6c5f7e ]
    
    Originally this used jhash2() over tuple and folded the zone id,
    the pernet hash value, destination port and l4 protocol number into the
    32bit seed value.
    
    When the switch to siphash was done, I used an on-stack temporary
    buffer to build a suitable key to be hashed via siphash().
    
    But this showed up as performance regression, so I got rid of
    the temporary copy and collected to-be-hashed data in 4 u64 variables.
    
    This makes it easy to build tuples that produce the same hash, which isn't
    desirable even though chain lengths are limited.
    
    Switch back to plain siphash, but just like with jhash2(), take advantage
    of the fact that most of to-be-hashed data is already in a suitable order.
    
    Use an empty struct as annotation in 'struct nf_conntrack_tuple' to mark
    last member that can be used as hash input.
    
    The only remaining data that isn't present in the tuple structure are the
    zone identifier and the pernet hash: fold those into the key.

    swiotlb: reduce the number of areas to match actual memory pool size
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ac04063354a01a484d2e55d20ed1958aa0d3392 ]
    
    Although the desired size of the SWIOTLB memory pool is increased in
    swiotlb_adjust_nareas() to match the number of areas, the actual allocation
    may be smaller, which may require reducing the number of areas.
    
    For example, Xen uses swiotlb_init_late(), which in turn uses the page
    allocator. On x86, page size is 4 KiB and MAX_ORDER is 10 (1024 pages),
    resulting in a maximum memory pool size of 4 MiB. This corresponds to 2048
    slots of 2 KiB each. The minimum area size is 128 (IO_TLB_SEGSIZE),
    allowing at most 2048 / 128 = 16 areas.
    
    If num_possible_cpus() is greater than the maximum number of areas, areas
    are smaller than IO_TLB_SEGSIZE and contiguous groups of free slots will
    span multiple areas. When allocating and freeing slots, only one area will
    be properly locked, causing race conditions on the unlocked slots and
    ultimately data corruption, kernel hangs and crashes.

    swiotlb: always set the number of areas before allocating the pool
    
    [ Upstream commit aabd12609f91155f26584508b01f548215cc3c0c ]
    
    The number of areas defaults to the number of possible CPUs. However, the
    total number of slots may have to be increased after adjusting the number
    of areas. Consequently, the number of areas must be determined before
    allocating the memory pool. This is even explained with a comment in
    swiotlb_init_remap(), but swiotlb_init_late() adjusts the number of areas
    after slots are already allocated. The areas may end up being smaller than
    IO_TLB_SEGSIZE, which breaks per-area locking.
    
    While fixing swiotlb_init_late(), move all relevant comments before the
    definition of swiotlb_adjust_nareas() and convert them to kernel-doc.

    drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Fix auxiliary bus lifetime
    
    [ Upstream commit 7aa83fbd712a6f08ffa67890061f26d140c2a84f ]
    
    Memory for the "struct device" for any given device isn't supposed to
    be released until the device's release() is called. This is important
    because someone might be holding a kobject reference to the "struct
    device" and might try to access one of its members even after any
    other cleanup/uninitialization has happened.
    
    Code analysis of ti-sn65dsi86 shows that this isn't quite right. When
    the code was written, it was believed that we could rely on the fact
    that the child devices would all be freed before the parent devices
    and thus we didn't need to worry about a release() function. While I
    still believe that the parent's "struct device" is guaranteed to
    outlive the child's "struct device" (because the child holds a kobject
    reference to the parent), the parent's "devm" allocated memory is a
    different story. That appears to be freed much earlier.
    
    Let's make this better for ti-sn65dsi86 by allocating each auxiliary
    with kzalloc and then free that memory in the release().

    drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: fix connector access for scdc
    
    [ Upstream commit 98703e4e061fb8715c7613cd227e32cdfd136b23 ]
    
    Commit 5d844091f237 ("drm/scdc-helper: Pimp SCDC debugs") changed the scdc
    interface to pick up an i2c adapter from a connector instead. However, in
    the case of dw-hdmi, the wrong connector was being used to pass i2c adapter
    information, since dw-hdmi's embedded connector structure is only populated
    when the bridge attachment callback explicitly asks for it.
    
    drm-meson is handling connector creation, so this won't happen, leading to
    a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix it by having scdc functions access dw-hdmi's current connector pointer
    instead, which is assigned during the bridge enablement stage.

    commit e3ea6467f623b80906ff0c93b58755ab903ce12f upstream.
    
    Commit 9f4211bf7f81 ("HID: add mapping for camera access keys") added
    mapping for the camera access keys, but unfortunately used wrong usage
    codes for them. HUTRR72[1] specifies that camera access controls use 0x76,
    0x077 and 0x78 usages in the consumer control page. Previously mapped 0xd5,
    0xd6 and 0xd7 usages are actually defined in HUTRR64[2] as game recording
    controls.

    security/integrity: fix pointer to ESL data and its size on pseries
    
    commit e66effaf61ffb1dc6088492ca3a0e98dcbf1c10d upstream.
    
    On PowerVM guest, variable data is prefixed with 8 bytes of timestamp.
    Extract ESL by stripping off the timestamp before passing to ESL parser.
