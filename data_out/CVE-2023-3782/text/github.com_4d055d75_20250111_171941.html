From a Bugcrowd submission ([Block-internal link](https://jira.sqprod.co/browse/VULN-69637), [Block-internal Bugcrowd link](https://tracker.bugcrowd.com/squareopensource/submissions/aebfae75-5aaf-4df9-877a-5a2d1dc01eaa)) weâ€™ve received, OkHttp is vulnerable to a Brotli decompression bomb DoS.

Receive a request body like this one can exhaust OkHttp:
