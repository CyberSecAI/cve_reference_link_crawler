- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The "ticket queue watchers" feature in ScienceLogic SL1 takes unsanitized user-controlled input and passes it directly to a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application does not sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low level privileges (authenticated access) to exploit the vulnerability.
