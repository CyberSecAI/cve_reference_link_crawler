    "related": true,
    "summary": "The application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users.",
     "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to the application's failure to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the `app.openDoc` or `LaunchAction` functions or ignoring encryption elements, transmitting form content in clear text without proper user prompts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Untrusted URL Invocation",
        "Information Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers could exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Handling of XFA documents",
        "Execution of app.openDoc function",
        "Execution of LaunchAction function",
         "Submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
           "Ability to craft malicious PDF files",
           "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
      ]
     },
    "additional_notes": "The advisory from ZDI states the vulnerability exists in the handling of Annotation objects and that the issue results from a lack of validating the existence of an object before performing operations on it. This can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution. The provided Foxit advisory provides more detail on the attack vectors."
