Subject: Mock, Snap, LXC expose(d) chroot, container trees with unsafe permissions and contents to host users, pose risk to host

Hi,

When Marco / Red Hat kindly brought the CVE-2023-6395 Mock issue:

<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/16/1">https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/16/1</a>

to linux-distros on January 8, this reminded me about another concern I
had also having to do with Mock, so I shared it with Marco and
linux-distros members on that same day and planned to post about it to
oss-security on the same day that CVE-2023-6395 was to be disclosed
publicly, which is today.  Included below is the essence of what was
said in the linux-distros thread, starting with my message:

Thank you Marco (and Red Hat) for bringing this to linux-distros.

While we're on the topic of Mock and its security updates, here's a
different concern I have:

The chroot trees that mock creates tend to be accessible by any system
user, not only those in the mock group.  This means that vulnerabilities
in SUID/SGID/setcap programs in current and leftover mock root trees may
be exploitable by any system user - an unnecessary and maybe unexpected
security exposure.

$ id
uid=1001(user) gid=1001(user) groups=1001(user) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
$ ls -ld /var/lib/mock
drwxrwxr-x. 6 root mock 4096 Nov 22 23:07 /var/lib/mock
$ ls -l /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 23832 Oct 28 11:26 /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
$ /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
This binary is not designed for running in this way
-- the system administrator has been informed

This shows that a user not in group mock could indeed run a SUID root
program from a mock root tree.  If that program contains a vulnerability
on its own (such as if it's an outdated copy) or when run from such
unexpected (by itself and its package) location, that is then exposed
for attacks by the user.

A further issue is that any world-writable directories in mock trees:

$ ls -ld /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/tmp
drwxrwxrwt. 4 root root 20480 Nov 22 23:44 /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/tmp

are in fact writable by all system users, including not in group mock,
and can be used for (symlink or such) attacks on a current or future
mock build (if a package's build uses temporary files unsafely).

They can also be used for disk space exhaustion on /var (perhaps to
prevent logs from being written), although this is only a new issue if
the host's /var/tmp isn't on the same device.

I suggest that /var/lib/mock permissions be hardened to 770 or 1770.
Optionally also permissions on /var/lib/mock/* and /var/lib/mock/*/root.

This change would not prevent users in group mock from performing such
attacks, but that can be considered a justified risk, to be documented.

I'll plan on mentioning this concern on oss-security also on January 16,
or/and you may.

Yes, I think it's part of a wider class of issues.

&gt; here's an example of setuid-root binaries from snaps on an Ubuntu system:
&gt; 
&gt; $ ls -l $(find /snap/ -type f -executable -perm -4000 -name su 2&gt;/dev/null)
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44664 nov.  29  2022 /snap/core18/2796/bin/su
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44664 nov.  29  2022 /snap/core18/2812/bin/su
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 67816 mai   30  2023 /snap/core20/2015/usr/bin/su
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 67816 mai   30  2023 /snap/core20/2105/usr/bin/su
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 55672 f??vr. 21  2022 /snap/core22/1033/usr/bin/su
&gt; -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 55672 f??vr. 21  2022 /snap/core22/864/usr/bin/su
&gt; 
&gt; (I count 64 such binaries on this particular system when not restricting
&gt; to "su" -- if there are older versions, as indeed there seems to be at a
&gt; glance, it's not unthinkable to find something buggy there that maybe
&gt; shouldn't be runnable.)
&gt; 
&gt; I could be completely wrong, I haven't looked into it. At a glance, many
&gt; of these binaries will not run directly because they are trying to load
&gt; older versions of shared libraries that don't exist in the default
&gt; search paths.

That's a very good point about incompatible shared libraries - things
can be much worse if the libraries do exist, but are just sufficiently
different to expose or create a vulnerability - potentially one that
didn't exist with binary+libraries versions in either the chroot or the
host system on its own.

&gt; Hello Vegard. Yes, this is a familiar old friend; here's an instance
&gt; from LXC in 2013: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1244635" rel="nofollow">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1244635</a>
&gt; 
&gt; Several years ago, when we were preparing fixes for a snapd issue,
&gt; I believe we issued *two* snapd updates -- the first to fix the bug,
&gt; the second to force snapd to garbage collect the old and vulnerable
&gt; version. (Which sort of defeats the point of snapd storing multiple
&gt; versions for roll-back.)
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect few application authors distributing snaps themselves would
&gt; think of it.
