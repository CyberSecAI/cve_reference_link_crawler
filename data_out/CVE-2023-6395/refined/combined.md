| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2252206#c0)  Marco Benatto    2023-11-30 05:36:36 UTC  ``` There is a flaw in the Mock software where an attacker may achieve privilege escalation and execute arbitrary code as the root user. This is due to the lack of sandboxing when expanding and executing Jinja2 templates that may be included in some configuration parameters. Mock documentation recommends that users added to the mock group on a system be treated as privileged users. However, some build systems that invoke mock on behalf of users may unintentionally allow less privileged users to define configuration tags that will be passed to mock as parameters when run. Configuration tags that allow Jinja2 templates could be used to achieve remote privilege escalation and run arbitrary code as root on the build server.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2252206#c5)  Marco Benatto    2024-01-16 13:53:13 UTC  ``` Created mock tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 2258608](show_bug.cgi?id=2258608 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2023-6395 mock: Privilege escalation for users that can access mock configuration [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2258607](show_bug.cgi?id=2258607 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2023-6395 mock: Privilege escalation for users that can access mock configuration [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2252206#c6)  Marco Benatto    2024-01-16 14:05:03 UTC  ``` Upstream commits for this issue: <https://github.com/xsuchy/templated-dictionary/commit/bcd90f0dafa365575c4b101e6f5d98c4ef4e4b69> <https://github.com/xsuchy/templated-dictionary/commit/0740bd0ca8d487301881541028977d120f8b8933>   ``` |  |

Subject: Mock, Snap, LXC expose(d) chroot, container trees with unsafe permissions and contents to host users, pose risk to host

Hi,

When Marco / Red Hat kindly brought the CVE-2023-6395 Mock issue:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/16/1>

to linux-distros on January 8, this reminded me about another concern I
had also having to do with Mock, so I shared it with Marco and
linux-distros members on that same day and planned to post about it to
oss-security on the same day that CVE-2023-6395 was to be disclosed
publicly, which is today.  Included below is the essence of what was
said in the linux-distros thread, starting with my message:

Thank you Marco (and Red Hat) for bringing this to linux-distros.

While we're on the topic of Mock and its security updates, here's a
different concern I have:

The chroot trees that mock creates tend to be accessible by any system
user, not only those in the mock group.  This means that vulnerabilities
in SUID/SGID/setcap programs in current and leftover mock root trees may
be exploitable by any system user - an unnecessary and maybe unexpected
security exposure.

$ id
uid=1001(user) gid=1001(user) groups=1001(user) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
$ ls -ld /var/lib/mock
drwxrwxr-x. 6 root mock 4096 Nov 22 23:07 /var/lib/mock
$ ls -l /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 23832 Oct 28 11:26 /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
$ /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/sbin/unix_chkpwd
This binary is not designed for running in this way
-- the system administrator has been informed

This shows that a user not in group mock could indeed run a SUID root
program from a mock root tree.  If that program contains a vulnerability
on its own (such as if it's an outdated copy) or when run from such
unexpected (by itself and its package) location, that is then exposed
for attacks by the user.

A further issue is that any world-writable directories in mock trees:

$ ls -ld /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/tmp
drwxrwxrwt. 4 root root 20480 Nov 22 23:44 /var/lib/mock/rocky-9-x86_64/root/tmp

are in fact writable by all system users, including not in group mock,
and can be used for (symlink or such) attacks on a current or future
mock build (if a package's build uses temporary files unsafely).

They can also be used for disk space exhaustion on /var (perhaps to
prevent logs from being written), although this is only a new issue if
the host's /var/tmp isn't on the same device.

I suggest that /var/lib/mock permissions be hardened to 770 or 1770.
Optionally also permissions on /var/lib/mock/* and /var/lib/mock/*/root.

This change would not prevent users in group mock from performing such
attacks, but that can be considered a justified risk, to be documented.

I'll plan on mentioning this concern on oss-security also on January 16,
or/and you may.

Yes, I think it's part of a wider class of issues.

That's a very good point about incompatible shared libraries - things
can be much worse if the libraries do exist, but are just sufficiently
different to expose or create a vulnerability - potentially one that
didn't exist with binary+libraries versions in either the chroot or the
host system on its own.

Make the TemplatedDictionary objects picklable

```
The jinja2 SandboxedEnvironment objects are not guaranteed to be
pickle-serializable (even though they practically are).  So let's rather
store the environment elsewhere than in the TemplatedDictionary object
itself to keep it serializable.

Nb. TemplatedDictionary is just a wrapper around dict, which is quite
commonly subject of (de)serialization (e.g. Mock, the main user of
templated-dictionary library does that through the
concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor logic).

It would be disadvantageous to introduce additional internal arguments
into the object itself (considering we already have the __jinja_expand
internal).

Having a per-application shared environment is kind of expected anyway
(and even more optimal):

    <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/api/#basics>

Note that this fix is mostly needed for the RHEL 8 environment with
jinja2 v2.10.1; newer versions made the environments (namely the
included filters) picklable: [pallets/jinja#1613](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1613)
```

```
The task of templated_dictionary object is pretty simple, it just
expands precisely defined set of templates (dictionary attributes).
Having a full power of Python interpreter in templates doesn't seem to
make any sense.  So let's make the library safer.

Subject: CVE-2023-6395 Mock: Privilege escalation for users that can access
 mock configuration

Summary:

There is a flaw in the Mock software
(<https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock>) where an attacker
may achieve privilege escalation and execute arbitrary code as the
root user. This is due to the lack of sandboxing when expanding and
executing Jinja2 templates that may be included in some configuration
parameters.

Mock is a chroot build environment manager for building RPM packages.
Mock uses Jinja2 templates for expanding configuration parameters
through the TemplatedDictionary python class.

This feature was introduced in mock 1.4 back in 2019 [1] and in 2021
the TemplatedDictionary code was split out to a separate project [2].

Mock documentation recommends that users added to the mock group on a
system be treated as privileged users [3]. However, some build systems
that invoke mock on behalf of users may unintentionally allow less
privileged users to define configuration tags that will be passed to
mock as parameters when run. Configuration tags that allow Jinja2
templates could be used to achieve remote privilege escalation and run
arbitrary code as root on the build server.

This issue is being identified by the CVE ID: CVE-2023-6395 with the
following CVSSv3.1 score:

6.7/CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The upstream patches for this issue can be found at:

<https://github.com/xsuchy/templated-dictionary/commit/bcd90f0dafa365575c4b101e6f5d98c4ef4e4b69>
<https://github.com/xsuchy/templated-dictionary/commit/0740bd0ca8d487301881541028977d120f8b8933>

The provided patches target the templated-dictionary module [4].

Please don't hesitate to reach us out in case of any doubts or concerns.
