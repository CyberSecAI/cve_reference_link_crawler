Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the EMC DPA Application service, specifically within how it parses the `preScript` parameter. The service fails to properly validate user-supplied input before using it to execute a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is a command injection vulnerability. By inserting malicious commands within the `preScript` parameter, an attacker can force the server to execute arbitrary system commands.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not adequately validate the `preScript` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
*   **System-Level Access:**  The arbitrary code execution happens in the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered through network communication with the EMC DPA Application service.
*   **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `preScript`.
*   **TCP Port 9002:** The service listens on TCP port 9002 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** Exploitation requires the attacker to be authenticated to the EMC Data Protection Advisor application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly by Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) without a patch from the vendor, due to their 120 day deadline.
*   The vendor initially considered this behavior to be "by design" rather than a vulnerability.
*   The vendor addressed other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-8002, CVE-2017-8003, and CVE-2017-8013) that, when chained with this issue, allowed pre-authentication remote code execution.  After these fixes, exploitation of this specific command injection requires authentication.
*   Mitigation strategy suggests using firewall rules/whitelisting to restrict access to the service to trusted machines.
