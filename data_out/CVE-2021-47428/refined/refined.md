- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The emergency stack path for program check interrupts was incorrectly jumping into a label within the `__GEN_COMMON_BODY` macro intended for the normal path, instead of jumping over it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect control flow in the exception handling code, leading to a corrupted interrupt frame and incorrect execution path. Specifically, the code used numeric labels for jumps, and the macro was not designed to handle that properly in the emergency stack case, causing it to jump to the wrong spot.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The incorrect jump resulted in a corrupted interrupt frame, a weird-looking trap frame on top, and the wrong `->nip` which caused issues with decoding bug messages and, ultimately, a kernel BUG. This could lead to system instability and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a program check interrupt which can occur during normal system operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to cause a program check exception to trigger the vulnerability. This could be achieved through various means like causing invalid memory access or other conditions that trigger program check exceptions. No specific user-level privilege is needed to trigger this bug once a program check occurs, however, controlling when/if a program check happens may require specific privileges, depending on how it is triggered.
