| | CWE Glossary Definition | x | | --- | --- | |  | |      CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine  | Weakness ID: 1336 [Vulnerability Mapping](#Vulnerability_Mapping_Notes_1336): ALLOWED This CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities    Abstraction: Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | | --- |    View customized information:  Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers.  Operational For users who are concerned with the practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts.  Mapping Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.  Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry.  Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.    × Edit Custom Filter Conceptual Operational Mapping Friendly Select All     Reset Clear Submit Cancel       + Description  The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.    + Extended Description   Many web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.  Template engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression "{{7\*7}}" and determine if the output returns "49" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.  In some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.  Template engines can be used on the server or client, so both "sides" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.     + Alternate Terms  | Server-Side Template Injection / SSTI: | This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server. | | --- | --- | | Client-Side Template Injection / CSTI: | This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client. |       + Common Consequences Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited to achieve a different impact.  | Scope | Impact | Likelihood | | --- | --- | --- | | Integrity | Technical Impact: *Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands* |  |      + Potential Mitigations  | Phase: Architecture and Design Choose a template engine that offers a sandbox or restricted mode, or at least limits the power of any available expressions, function calls, or commands. | | --- | | Phase: Implementation Use the template engine's sandbox or restricted mode, if available. |       +  Relationships  Section Help This table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.  + Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)  | Nature | Type | ID | Name | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ChildOf | Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | 94 | [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')](/data/definitions/94.html) | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | PeerOf | Base Base - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. | 917 | [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')](/data/definitions/917.html) |            + Modes Of Introduction Section HelpThe different Modes of Introduction provide information about how and when this weakness may be introduced. The Phase identifies a point in the life cycle at which introduction may occur, while the Note provides a typical scenario related to introduction during the given phase.  | Phase | Note | | --- | --- | | Architecture and Design | The developer might choose a template engine that makes it easier for programmers to write vulnerable code. | | Implementation | The programmer might not use engine's built-in sandboxes or other capabilities to escape or otherwise prevent template injection from untrusted input. |      + Applicable Platforms Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance. Languages  Java (Undetermined Prevalence)   PHP (Undetermined Prevalence)   Python (Undetermined Prevalence)   JavaScript (Undetermined Prevalence)   Class: Interpreted (Undetermined Prevalence)  Operating Systems  Class: Not OS-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)  Technologies  AI/ML (Undetermined Prevalence)   Class: Client Server (Undetermined Prevalence)      + Observed Examples  | Reference | Description | | --- | --- | | [CVE-2024-34359](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34359) | Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a "prompt injection" attack. | | [CVE-2017-16783](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-16783) | server-side template injection in content management server | | [CVE-2020-9437](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9437) | authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection | | [CVE-2020-12790](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-12790) | Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template | | [CVE-2021-21244](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21244) | devops platform allows SSTI | | [CVE-2020-4027](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-4027) | bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates | | [CVE-2020-26282](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26282) | web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection | | [CVE-2020-1961](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-1961) | SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions | | [CVE-2019-19999](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-19999) | product does not use a "safe" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI | | [CVE-2018-20465](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-20465) | product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection |       + Memberships  Section HelpThis MemberOf Relationships table shows additional CWE Categories and Views that reference this weakness as a member. This information is often useful in understanding where a weakness fits within the context of external information sources.  | Nature | Type | ID | Name | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | MemberOf | CategoryCategory - a CWE entry that contains a set of other entries that share a common characteristic. | 1409 | [Comprehensive Categorization: Injection](/data/definitions/1409.html) | | --- | --- | --- | --- |       + Vulnerability Mapping Notes  | Usage: ALLOWED  (this CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities) | | --- | | Reason:  Acceptable-Use | | Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. | | Comments: Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction. |       + Notes  Relationship  Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with [CWE-917](/data/definitions/917.html) (Expression Language Injection). XSS ([CWE-79](/data/definitions/79.html)) is also co-located with template injection.    Maintenance  The interrelationships and differences between [CWE-917](/data/definitions/917.html) and [CWE-1336](/data/definitions/1336.html) need to be further clarified.       + References  | [REF-1193] James Kettle.
