**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses Jinja2 templates, which are vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) if user-controlled input is used in template rendering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability, where user-provided content in recipe templates is evaluated as code by the Jinja2 templating engine.
- Arbitrary file upload vulnerability, which allows low-privilege users to upload templates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting a malicious payload into the recipe template.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must log in to the application.
- The attacker uploads a malicious template (e.g. a "recipe" template).
- The attacker triggers the export functionality, causing the template to be processed by the Jinja2 engine, resulting in the execution of the injected code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account in the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload a recipe template, which can be done by both admin and low-privilege users.
