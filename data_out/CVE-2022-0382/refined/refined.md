The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0382.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `struct tipc_socket_addr.ref` has a 4-byte hole. The function `__tipc_getname()` copies this structure, including the uninitialized hole, to user space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel information leak: Uninitialized kernel memory is copied to user space via the `__tipc_getname()` function when handling the `getpeername` syscall.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read uninitialized kernel memory, which may contain sensitive information. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path by calling the `getpeername` system call on a TIPC socket.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and use TIPC sockets, which typically requires local access to the system.
