| A memory allocation failure unhandled in Ap4RtpAtom.cpp and leads to crashes. This seems to be an incomplete fix of issue [#396](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/issues/396), [CVE-2019-13238](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f2mp-r4m2-962r "CVE-2019-13238").  `./mp42aac input_file /dev/null`  In file Source/C++/Core/Ap4RtpAtom.cpp [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7632714/196694985-02cb68d8-62b7-44e4-ac8a-01137ddd038e.png) AP4\_RtpAtom allocate a new buffer to parse the atom in the stream. The unhandled memory allocation failure cause the read content memcpy to a null pointer.  The rest of issue seems be similar with previous issue.  Asan trace report:  ``` ==725001==WARNING: AddressSanitizer failed to allocate 0xffffffffff00025b bytes ================================================================= ==725001==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: allocator is out of memory trying to allocate 0xffffffffff00025b bytes     #0 0x4f7fb7 in operator new[](unsigned long)  /dependence/llvm11/llvm-11.0.0.src/projects/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_new_delete.cpp:102:3     #1 0x652e4a in AP4_RtpAtom::AP4_RtpAtom(unsigned int, AP4_ByteStream&)  /benchmark/Bento4/Source/C++/Core/Ap4RtpAtom.cpp:50:25  ==725001==HINT: if you don't care about these errors you may set allocator_may_return_null=1 SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: out-of-memory  /dependence/llvm11/llvm-11.0.0.src/projects/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_new_delete.cpp:102:3 in operator new[](unsigned long) ==725001==ABORTING  ```  [mp42aac\_exhaustive\_AP4\_RtpAtom50.zip](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/files/9820612/mp42aac_exhaustive_AP4_RtpAtom50.zip) (unzip first) |
