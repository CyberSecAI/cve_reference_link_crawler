The provided content relates to CVE-2024-40965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The i2c-imx-lpi2c driver repeatedly calls `clk_get_rate` for each I2C transfer. This can lead to a deadlock when another clock provider, such as an audio codec (tlv320aic32x4), also needs to access the I2C bus while holding a clock mutex. The I2C access, in turn, requires the same mutex for `clk_get_rate`, resulting in a deadlock scenario.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock caused by the nested locking of the clock mutex.
-   **Inefficient clock access:** Repeatedly calling `clk_get_rate` for each transfer is inefficient.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **System freeze:** The deadlock can lead to a system freeze or hang, making the device unresponsive.
-   **Denial of service:** The deadlock effectively causes a denial of service as the I2C bus becomes unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Device driver interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through normal device driver interactions, specifically when an I2C device is used and a clock provider is active.
-   **Concurrency:** The issue arises due to concurrent access to the clock and I2C resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Ability to load and use an I2C device driver:** An attacker needs to trigger the I2C bus to be used concurrently with another clock provider, such as by adding an audio codec, in order to trigger the deadlock
