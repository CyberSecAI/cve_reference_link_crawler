  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header value sent.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The process could crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HTTP request with a malformed `If:` header.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
