Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-31794:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `pdf_mark_list_push` function within MuPDF v1.21.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core vulnerability is **infinite recursion**. The `pdf_mark_list_push` function is susceptible to being called recursively without proper exit conditions, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a **Denial of Service (DoS)** condition. The infinite recursion consumes system resources (stack space), causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a **specially crafted PDF file**. An attacker can create a malicious PDF that, when processed by MuPDF v1.21.1, triggers the infinite recursion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF to a system using the vulnerable version of MuPDF.
- There is no need for the attacker to be in any special position or have special privileges on the target system.
