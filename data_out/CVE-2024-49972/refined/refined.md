The provided content relates to a fix for a memory leak in the AMD display driver. It addresses the issue described in the commit message: "Deallocate DML memory if allocation fails".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that when the `dml2_create` function fails to allocate memory during the creation of a DC state, the allocated memory for the `dc_state` structure was not being deallocated. This results in an uninitialized structure that is not NULL, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory leak:** Failure to deallocate memory upon allocation failure leads to a memory leak. Specifically, if either of the `dml2_create` calls fail, the partially allocated `dc_state` is not freed, resulting in leaked memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Resource exhaustion:**  Repeated failures in `dml2_create` can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially impacting the stability and performance of the system.
- **Undefined behavior:** The uninitialized structure may lead to undefined behavior when used in subsequent operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `dml2_create` function fails due to some error during memory allocation which can happen during normal operation, and may be influenced by system state.
- There is no indication that this is an easily triggered or remotely exploitable vulnerability.
- The trigger is internal and not a direct user input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position is required other than to be running code within an environment that uses the AMD display driver with the vulnerable code. An attacker might be able to influence the memory allocation environment to increase the likelihood of allocation failures.

**Fix:**
The patch adds checks for the return values of `dml2_create`, and deallocates the `dc_state` memory via `dc_state_release()` if either of the `dml2_create` calls fail. This ensures that if the memory allocation fails, the allocated memory is cleaned up, preventing a leak.
