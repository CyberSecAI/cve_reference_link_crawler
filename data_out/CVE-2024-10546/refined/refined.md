Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the Teaching online teaching platform. Specifically, it exists in how the application handles user-supplied input in the `getDictItemsByTable` API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided to the `/api/sys/ng-alain/getDictItemsByTable/` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the system's database. This may include user credentials (usernames and passwords), personal information, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/api/sys/ng-alain/getDictItemsByTable/`.
- **Injected SQL Code:** The attacker injects SQL code within the URL, specifically within the single quotes in the path, for example: `/api/sys/ng-alain/getDictItemsByTable/'%20from%20sys_user/username,password%20'/x.js`. The example shows retrieval of usernames and passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or special privileges within the application are mentioned as being needed. The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and be able to construct a malicious request including the SQL injection payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Teaching online teaching platform" versions <= 2.7.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the `sys_user` table.
*   There is currently no patch available for this vulnerability.
*   The `icon_hash` mentioned in the content could potentially be used for identifying the vulnerable application via internet-wide scanning.
