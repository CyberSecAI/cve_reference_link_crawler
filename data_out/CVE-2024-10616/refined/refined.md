Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `pda/workflow/webSignSubmit.php` file of Tongda OA.
*   The `$saleId` parameter within this file is not properly sanitized or processed, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract information from the database, including table structures, user credentials, and other confidential data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection could allow further exploitation of the system, possibly leading to remote code execution. The provided exploit attempts to extract the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `webSignSubmit.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `sealId` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tongda OA application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.
*   **Target Parameter Knowledge**: The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and endpoint

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Tongda OA versions v11.2 to v11.9.
*   The provided exploit examples use SQL functions like `DATABASE()` and `substr()` to extract database information.
*   The attacker is shown attempting to enumerate the database name, character by character using `substr()` and `char()` functions.
*   The successful extraction of the database name `td_oa` demonstrates successful SQL injection.
