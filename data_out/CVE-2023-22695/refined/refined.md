- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Custom Field Template plugin versions <= 2.5.8 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to induce authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious webpage that makes a request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into executing it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
