Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Querybook application's WebSocket server allowing connections from all origins. This was due to a misconfiguration in the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings, where the server did not properly restrict the allowed origins for WebSocket connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to CSWSH. By allowing all origins, a malicious website could establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable Querybook instance and perform actions on behalf of the user who is authenticated within the application in another browser tab.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:
- **Read DataDocs:** Access and read sensitive data stored in user's datadocs.
- **Edit DataDocs:** Modify or manipulate data within datadocs, potentially causing data corruption.
- **Remove DataDocs:** Delete or remove user's datadocs, resulting in data loss.
- **Live Status Manipulation:** Observe and possibly tamper with the live status of query executions, potentially leading to misleading results or disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to lure a logged-in Querybook user to visit a malicious website they control. This site would then establish a connection to the user's Querybook session over a websocket and perform malicious operations.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) like attack over websocket:** While not traditional CSRF due to using websockets, the attacker can exploit the user's valid authenticated session within the application by crafting specific malicious websocket requests from a different origin

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a logged-in Querybook user to visit a malicious site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the victim's Querybook instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected Querybook versions prior to 3.32.0.
- The fix involves configuring the WebSocket server to only accept connections from a specified list of allowed origins.
- The severity is rated as low.
- The vulnerability was reported by HakuPiku.
- The fix was implemented in PR #1425.
