# Cross-site websocket hijacking

Low

[jczhong84](/jczhong84)
published
GHSA-5349-j4c9-x767
Mar 13, 2024

## Package

querybook
(DockerHub)

## Affected versions

<3.32.0

## Patched versions

3.32.0

## Description

### Impact

Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CROS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user.

### Patches

Please upgrade to version v3.32

### Workarounds

No workarounds for now.

### References

Please refer to the [PR](https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1425) for details

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-28251

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

### @jczhong84 **[jczhong84](/jczhong84)** commented [Mar 13, 2024](#issue-2184913365)

Currently we allow all origins to connect to the websocket server. This change is to change the behavior for production to be configurable with a list of origins.

Sorry, something went wrong.
