- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the parsing of name constraint extensions in X.509 certificates. Specifically, if the extension included both permitted subtrees and excluded subtrees, only the permitted subtree was checked.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of X.509 certificate name constraint extensions, specifically when both permitted and excluded subtrees are present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A certificate containing a name that should have been excluded by the excluded subtree, but was permitted by the permitted subtree, would be incorrectly accepted. This could lead to the acceptance of unauthorized certificates. The integrity of the system is impacted since unauthorized certificates could potentially be used.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks using maliciously crafted X.509 certificates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to generate X.509 certificates that have both permitted and excluded subtrees, and have the target application process these certificates. No user interaction is required and no privileges are required.
