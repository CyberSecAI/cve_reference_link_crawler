An issue was discovered in the friendlycaptcha_official (aka Integration of Friendly Captcha) extension before 0.1.4 for TYPO3. The extension fails to check the requirement of the captcha field in submitted form data, allowing a remote user to bypass the captcha check. This only affects the captcha integration for the ext:form extension.
