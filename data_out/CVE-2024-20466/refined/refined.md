- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper enforcement of administrative privilege levels for high-value sensitive data in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists due to inadequate checks on access control, allowing users with "read-only Administrator" privileges to access pages containing sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit enables a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with "read-only Administrator" privileges. They exploit the vulnerability by browsing to specific pages that contain sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires network access to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco ISE device and must have valid "read-only Administrator" credentials.
