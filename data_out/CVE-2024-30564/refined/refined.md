Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-30564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `updateStateInternal` function in the `@andrei-tatar/nora-firebase-common` module. This function recursively copies properties from a user-supplied input to a destination object without proper sanitization or validation of the input keys. This allows an attacker to inject properties like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` to modify the base Object prototype.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue. The lack of input sanitization allows modification of the base object prototype by injecting properties like `__proto__`, allowing modification of all objects.
*   **Insecure Recursive Copy:** The `updateStateInternal` function recursively copies all child properties from source to destination object without key validation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability occurs due to missing validation of keys when updating objects. The code does not properly filter or block attempts to modify special properties like `__proto__` or `constructor`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Modification of the object prototype can cause unexpected behavior or errors, leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some contexts, prototype pollution vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged to achieve RCE if the application uses polluted objects in unsafe ways.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to manipulate the prototype of objects can potentially allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Application Logic Manipulation:** Altering prototypes can change how objects function throughout the application, leading to incorrect behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulated Input Data:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted JSON or object payload containing the vulnerable `__proto__` property to the `updateState` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Supply Input to `updateState` Function:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable `updateState` function in the application that utilizes the affected module.
*   **Knowledge of API Usage:** Attacker must be familiar with how the affected module's `updateState` is used.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype` by providing an input with the `__proto__` property.
*   The fix for the vulnerability is to upgrade the module to version 1.12.3 or later, which includes a fix to prevent the prototype pollution.
*   The code changes in the provided github diff show the addition of an `ignoreKeys` list to prevent the modification of the `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` properties.
