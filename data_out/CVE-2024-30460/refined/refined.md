  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a higher-privileged user, executes unwanted actions within the plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in, higher-privileged user to trigger a malicious request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability but they need a target user to be authenticated."
