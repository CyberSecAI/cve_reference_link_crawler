**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `MultiPathResource` class in Atlassian FishEye and Crucible is vulnerable to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system using crafted paths.
- Insecure direct object reference (IDOR): Although not explicitly named in the description, the vulnerability allows access to arbitrary files, which can be seen as a form of IDOR.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An anonymous remote attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's local file system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need authentication and can be any remote user. The vulnerable instance must be running on a Microsoft Windows operating system.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue only affects Windows versions of FishEye and Crucible. It was tested on OSX and confirmed not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.4.1.
- A workaround involves creating a `$FISHEYE_INST\content` directory (which can be empty) to mitigate the vulnerability.
