### Description

The MultiPathResource class in Atlassian FishEye and Crucible, before version 4.4.1 allows anonymous remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a path traversal vulnerability when FishEye or Crucible are running on the Microsoft Windows operating system.

### Workaround

Create $FISHEYE\_INST\content directory, which can be empty but must exists.

\*Note: \* This only affects windows versions - I tested on OSX and it is not vulnerable to this issue.
