- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TweetScroll Widget plugin for WordPress, versions 1.3.7 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into a website. This is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various impacts such as redirects, injecting advertisements, and other HTML payload execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields or settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject the malicious script, which might require some level of access depending on the specific injection point within the plugin (e.g. plugin settings), and that an end-user then would have to trigger the execution of the malicious script by visiting the web page containing the vulnerable content. The minimum required privilege is stated as "Contributor".
