Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application directly uses the `$id` parameter from the URL in an SQL query without proper sanitization or input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not sanitize the user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, SQL injection can be used to gain control over the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Vulnerable File:** The vulnerable code is located in `/oews/admin/?page=products/manage_product`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privilege is mentioned.
- No user authentication requirement is explicitly stated.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `/oews/admin/?page=products/manage_product` URL.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the use of `updatexml` function to extract the database name, which is a typical way of testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The code analysis section confirms that the `id` parameter is used directly in SQL queries.
