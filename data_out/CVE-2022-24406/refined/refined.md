The provided content contains details for multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-24406.

**CVE-2022-24406**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability stems from predictable HTTP multipart-formdata boundaries. The boundaries are created based on a timestamp with millisecond resolution, allowing an attacker to predict future boundaries and overwrite their content.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to predictable multipart-formdata boundaries.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can modify parameters of internal API calls to OX Documentconverter, potentially circumventing network trust boundaries. This can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), enabling an attacker to leverage other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2022-23100) with limited privileges using OX App Suite API as a proxy.  The impact includes modifying parameters of internal API calls, leading to information disclosure (read), limited modification capabilities and limited denial of service due to the SSRF.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Creating a HTTP request with multipart-formdata boundaries representing timestamps in the near future.
    *   Adding internal API parameters to those multipart-formdata sections and using them as requests to the OX App Suite API.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to make API calls to the OX App Suite, and thus requires at least authenticated access to the App Suite. They would need to craft a specific request to exploit the predictable boundaries, but this does not necessarily require privileged network or system access.
