- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DImage 360 WordPress plugin, versions 2.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when users visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts. The specific entry points for injection are not detailed but are implied to be user-controlled inputs or parameters processed by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts, which often requires the ability to influence the content processed by the vulnerable plugin. The specific privilege required is 'Contributor', which implies that an attacker with at least this level of access to the WordPress site can potentially exploit the vulnerability.
