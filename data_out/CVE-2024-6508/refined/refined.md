{
  "CVE-2024-6508": {
    "Description": "openshift-console: OAuth2 insufficient state parameter entropy",
    "Root cause": "The OAuth2 protocol is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if the state parameter is used inefficiently. An attacker can perform a normal OAuth2 process and get the redirection URL that contains the authorization code of the third-party. The attacker can bind his account to victim’s account for the vulnerable application by enticing a victim to access this URL. If the state parameter is set in the redirection URL but without sufficient entropy, then an attacker can predict the user’s state parameter and forge a reliable redirection URL to induce the victim to access and implement a CSRF attack.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient entropy in the state parameter of the OAuth2 flow leading to CSRF vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain access to other user’s accounts and access sensitive information of the profile, or perform arbitrary actions using the victim’s account.",
    "Attack vectors": "Enticing the victim to access a forged redirection URL that contains a predictable state parameter, allowing the attacker to bind their account to the victim's account in the vulnerable application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate a normal OAuth2 process to obtain a valid redirection URL with an authorization code, and must be able to predict the state parameter used in the redirection URL of the victim."
