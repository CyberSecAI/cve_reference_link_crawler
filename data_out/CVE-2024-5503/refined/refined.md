Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The plugin suffers from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to the improper handling of file paths in include/require statements within PHP files. Specifically, the plugin uses a user-controlled value (`$layoutOption`) to construct file paths which are then included.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is because the plugin does not sanitize the `$layoutOption` parameter. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including arbitrary PHP files, attackers can execute PHP code present in those files. This can lead to complete control of the WordPress website and server.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** Attackers can use LFI to bypass WordPress access controls by including files that might reveal sensitive data or enable further exploitation.
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** If the attacker includes files that contain sensitive data, like database credentials, this data could be exposed.
- **Remote Code Execution:** While the vulnerability is "Local" File Inclusion, attackers could upload malicious PHP files and then include them using the LFI, achieving remote code execution in practice.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is via the `layoutOption` parameter which is unsanitized when passed to include/require calls within the plugin's PHP files. This parameter can be manipulated to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin renders blocks that are generated with the affected code path.
    - /includes/gutenberg.php (lines 884, 901, 918)
    - /includes/src/grid/element.php (line 1146)
    - /includes/src/list/element.php (line 1136)
    - /includes/src/masonry/element.php (line 1134)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must have at least Contributor level access to WordPress.
- **No Special Network Position:** The attacker only needs network access to the WordPress application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the plugin's code where the `$layoutOption` parameter is used directly in include/require statements without sanitization.
- Patched versions (1.1.4 and above) address this vulnerability.
- The provided Wordfence article mentions that this LFI vulnerability can be used to include "safe" file types, and "achieve code execution." This implies that attackers can upload files with "safe" extensions, rename them to include php, or exploit other file upload methods to get malicious php code on the server.
