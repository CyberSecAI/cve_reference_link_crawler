The provided content contains information related to a security issue in the open5gs project, specifically addressing crashes and protocol violations. This information is relevant to understanding potential vulnerabilities within the software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) component of open5gs crashes due to assertion failures when processing specific sequences of NAS (Non-Access Stratum) messages from a UE (User Equipment).
  -  `ogs_nas_encrypt: Assertion pkbuf->len failed` in `../lib/nas/common/security.c:86`
  - `gmm_state_authentication: Assertion r != OGS_ERROR failed` in `../src/amf/gmm-sm.c:1561`
- An incorrect protocol transition occurs where the core network responds with an Authentication Request message after receiving an Identity Response message, without prior Registration/Attach Request message, which violates the 3GPP standard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Assertion failures in `ogs_nas_encrypt` and `gmm_state_authentication` indicate potential coding errors or unexpected input handling.
- The incorrect protocol transition represents a logic flaw where the system does not properly enforce the expected sequence of messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The assertion failures in AMF lead to a crash of the service, which constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
- The protocol violation could lead to unexpected behaviour or further exploitable conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specific sequence of NAS messages from a UE triggers the crashes in AMF.
- Sending an Identity Response message without prior Registration/Attach Request message triggers the incorrect state transition in the core network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send NAS messages as a UE in the network.
