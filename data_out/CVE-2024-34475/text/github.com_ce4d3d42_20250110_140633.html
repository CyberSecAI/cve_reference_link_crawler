### @acetcom **[acetcom](/acetcom)** commented [Apr 9, 2024](#issue-2232781180)

The AMF will crash on the following locations when it receives a sequence of NAS messages from a UE.

* ogs\_nas\_encrypt: Assertion `pkbuf->len' failed. (../lib/nas/common/security.c:86)
* gmm\_state\_authentication: Assertion `r != OGS\_ERROR' failed. (../src/amf/gmm-sm.c:1561)

Besides the crashes found above, an incorrect protocol transition is identified in Open5GS. Without any Registration/Attach Request message, when the Identity Response message sent, the Core Network responds with an Authentication Request message. According to the standard, only the Registration/Attach Request message can start a state transition from the 5GMM/EMM-DEREGISTERED state to the 5GMM/EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED.

So I've modified the relevant code to address these issues.

Sorry, something went wrong.
