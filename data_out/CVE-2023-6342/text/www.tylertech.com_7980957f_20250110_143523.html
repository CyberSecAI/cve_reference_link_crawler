## Integrated Software for Courts & Justice Agencies

Regardless of size or location, courts and justice agencies have one thing in common — the need to improve access to justice for citizens, to empower legal professionals, and to enable collaboration across justice agencies.

Tyler's courts and justice software solutions help agencies share data among all of the offices in the justice system — Connecting courts, prosecutors, and public defenders, as well as jails, auditors, inspectors general, police departments, and supervision offices. This integration saves time and creates operational efficiencies, eliminating redundancies, minimizing errors, and helping you to be more responsive to your citizens.

### Civil Process

Meet your jurisdiction's unique civil process office, field and financial requirements. Tyler's flexible configuration make operations more efficient from business processes to state reporting requirements.
