|  |  | # Change Log |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## [2.0.1] - 2024-07-15 |
|  |  | - Security Improvement: Added authentication and authorization checks for HTTP |
|  |  | OPTIONS requests in OpaMiddleware. This ensures that OPTIONS requests are |
|  |  | subjected to the same security policies as other HTTP methods, preventing |
|  |  | potential information leaks. |
|  |  | [See advisory for more details](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5f5c-8rvc-j8wf) |
|  |  | - Update dependencies due to multiple vulnerabilities. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## [2.0.0] - 2024-02-07 |
|  |  | - Drop Python 3.7 support due to FastAPI update |
|  |  | - Update dependencies due to vulnerabilities: |
