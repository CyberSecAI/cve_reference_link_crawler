- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in the `upid` parameter within the `/view-user-detail.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data and/or execution of arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Injecting a crafted SQL payload into the `upid` parameter via a web request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `upid` parameter.
