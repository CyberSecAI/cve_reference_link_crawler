Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-26946.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `arch_adjust_kprobe_addr()` function in the Linux kernel's kprobes module for x86 architecture was reading from a potentially unsafe address without proper validation, which could cause a kernel panic if a user specifies an inaccessible data area.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper address validation: The `arch_adjust_kprobe_addr()` function directly dereferenced the given address `addr` without ensuring it was within a valid memory region.
- Lack of fault handling: The code used a direct memory read `*(u32 *)addr` which does not handle cases where the memory location is invalid, leading to a kernel panic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic: If a user specifies an invalid address for kprobe, it will cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-specified address: An attacker can specify an address outside of the valid memory region when using the kprobes mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to use the kprobes mechanism, which typically requires root or elevated privileges.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `arch_adjust_kprobe_addr()` function in `arch/x86/kernel/kprobes/core.c`.
- The function previously directly dereferenced the `addr` using `*(u32 *)addr` to check if it is an `endbr` instruction.
- The fix replaces this direct dereference with `copy_from_kernel_nofault(&insn, (void *)addr, sizeof(u32))`, which safely copies the data or returns an error.
- The vulnerability was reported by the syzcaller bot, indicating automated fuzzing techniques were able to discover it.
