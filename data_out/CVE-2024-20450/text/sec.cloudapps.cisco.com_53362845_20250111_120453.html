For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-spa-http-vulns-RJZmX2Xz>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect all software releases that run on Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones, regardless of the configuration. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2024-20450, CVE-2024-20452, and CVE-2024-20454: Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series and SPA500 Series IP Phones Web UI Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability**  Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges.  These vulnerabilities exist because incoming HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors, which could result in a buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute arbitrary commands at the *root* privilege level.  Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwk31988](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk31988)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20450, CVE-2024-20452, and CVE-2024-20454Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2024-20451 and CVE-2024-20453: Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series and SPA500 Series IP Phones Web UI DoS Vulnerability**  Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.  These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet to the remote interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the device.  Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwk31988](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk31988)CVE ID: CVE-2024-20451 and CVE-2024-20453SIR: HighCVSS Base Score: 7.5CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has not released and will not release software updates to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
