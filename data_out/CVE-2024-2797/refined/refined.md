Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2797

**Root Cause:** The `toggleRolesAndPermissions` and `editAllowedRolesAndPermissions` functions in the `RolePermissionController.php` file lack capability checks. This means that any user, regardless of their role or permissions, can trigger these functions.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing Capability Check:** The core issue is the absence of authorization checks before executing sensitive actions. These actions should be restricted to administrators or users with specific capabilities.
*   **Insecure Role Management:** The plugin allows modification of role permissions without proper verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Unauthenticated users can modify the plugin's settings to allow lower-level users to edit forms, potentially leading to unauthorized data manipulation or injection of malicious content via the forms.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Lower-level users could modify forms to redirect subscribers or alter collected data, impacting data integrity and email marketing efforts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Request:** An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the WordPress site to trigger the vulnerable functions.
*   **Direct Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing the vulnerable endpoints without needing to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific user role to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.7.6.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.7.7.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `official-mailerlite-sign-up-forms/trunk/src/Controllers/RolePermissionController.php`.
*   The fix involves adding a nonce check and verifying admin privileges.
