- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Avira Spotlight Service, where a symbolic link can be created to trick the service into deleting an arbitrary file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is an exploitable vulnerability in the Avira Spotlight Service related to file deletion operations. The service does not properly handle symbolic links allowing for unintended file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to local privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system, and then can create a symbolic link to trigger the vulnerable behavior in the Avira Spotlight Service.
