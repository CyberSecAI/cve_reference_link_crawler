# HTTP Host Header Injection in Request Handling

## Package

composer

typo3/cms-core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

11.0.0-11.4.0

## Patched versions

11.5.0

## Description

> ### Meta
>
> * CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (3.5)

### Problem

It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP *Host* header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP *Host* header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment.

This vulnerability is the same as described in [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941)](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2014-001/). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing setting *$GLOBALS['TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern']* (used as an effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.

### Solution

Update your instance to TYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the problem described.

### Credits

Thanks to TYPO3 framework merger Benjamin Franzke who reported and fixed the issue.
