The provided document is an Adobe Security Bulletin (APSB24-28) detailing multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). It includes CVE-2024-36182, which is listed as a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2024-36182:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the AEM application, specifically a stored XSS vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), categorized under CWE-79.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session. This can potentially lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker injects malicious script that is stored on the server. When a user interacts with the compromised content, the script is executed in the user's browser.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and needs to trick a user into interacting with the malicious content by requiring user interaction (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), indicating that the injected script executes within the security context of the web application which may have access to sensitive information.

The bulletin also notes that other stored XSS vulnerabilities, along with other types of vulnerabilities such as Improper Access Control (CVE-2024-26029) and Improper Input Validation (CVE-2024-26126, CVE-2024-26127, CVE-2024-36226, CVE-2024-41839, CVE-2024-41849) are being addressed in the same update.
