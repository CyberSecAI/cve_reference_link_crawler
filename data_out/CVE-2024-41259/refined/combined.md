|  | [Suggested description] |
| --- | --- |
|  | Navidrome v0.52.3 was discovered to use an insecure hashing algorithm |
|  | to generate URLs. |
|  |  |
|  | the official Gravatar documentation now advocates using SHA-256 to generate URLs, |
|  | as demonstrated in their API example (https://docs.gravatar.com/api/avatars/go/). |
|  |  |
|  | An MD5-based URL could potentially lead to situations where an attacker change |
|  | another user's info under a controlled email address, introducing security |
|  | vulnerabilities due to the known weaknesses of the MD5 algorithm. Although |
|  | this concern primarily pertains to Gravatar's service, adhering to best |
|  | practices by upgrading to a more secure hashing algorithm such as |
|  | SHA-256 would significantly mitigate these risks. |
