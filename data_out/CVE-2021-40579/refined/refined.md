Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to the application using predictable IDs to access user resources. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used to fetch user data and admission details without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the `id` parameter to access and manipulate resources, allowing an attacker to access other users' data by simply changing the ID in the request.
*   **Lack of proper authorization checks:** The application does not verify whether the user making the request is authorized to access the specified resource identified by the given ID.
*   **Business Logic Flaw:** The IDOR vulnerability also leads to a business logic flaw as an attacker can confirm the admission of other students and download their payment receipts without any authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access to PII:** An attacker can access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of other users, including their admission details and payment invoices.
*   **Manipulation of user data:** An attacker can confirm admissions of other students without any authorization.
*   **Download receipts:** An attacker can download payment receipts for other users, potentially for fraudulent purposes.
*   **Bypass authentication:** An attacker can download receipts without logging in, by fuzzing or knowing the id parameter.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct manipulation of URL parameters:** An attacker can directly manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL to access other users' resources.
*   **ID Fuzzing/Enumeration:** An attacker can try different ID values in the `id` parameter to access various resources, if the ID is easily guessable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `id` parameter in the URL.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the system to some degree (i.e., how to login to admin panel, where to find list of students) but does not need to be an authenticated user to download receipts.
*   No special privileges are required; any user (even without logging in for the receipt download vulnerability) can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is "Online Enrollment Management System" in PHP with "Paypal Payment System".
*   The vulnerable version of the software is 1.0.
*   The vulnerability exists on multiple locations in the application
