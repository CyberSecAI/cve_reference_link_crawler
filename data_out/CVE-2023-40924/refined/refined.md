Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `downloader.php` file of Contec SolarView Compact. Specifically, the `file` parameter is vulnerable to directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to traverse directories using the `file` parameter in the `downloader.php` script. This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server.
- **Credential Compromise:** Specifically, the attacker can read the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially obtaining password hashes, including the root administrator's hash, which could be cracked to gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP request to the `downloader.php` script, specifically manipulating the `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable SolarView Compact server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal in the `downloader.php` file of Contec SolarView Compact. An attacker can exploit it by manipulating the `file` parameter to read arbitrary files, leading to sensitive information disclosure, including password hashes from `/etc/passwd`. This can potentially result in complete system compromise by obtaining the root administrator credentials.
