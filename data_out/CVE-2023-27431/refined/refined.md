{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Big Store theme for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case but can include unwanted changes to the website or other administrative tasks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link, which would then trigger a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated administrator into submitting it. They do not need prior access to the WordPress site."
