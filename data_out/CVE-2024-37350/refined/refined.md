- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the policy management UI of Absolute Secure Access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can interfere with a system administratorâ€™s use of the policy management UI. Specifically, the attacker can compromise the integrity of the system (high impact), but there is no loss of confidentiality, and system availability is unaffected.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must convince a victim administrator to follow a crafted link to the vulnerable component while the victim administrator is authenticated to the console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and convince an authenticated administrator to click it. The attacker also needs to be authenticated to the console to craft this link.
