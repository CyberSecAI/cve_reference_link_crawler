| * [Prev : 3.3.Â POM Syntax](pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html) * [TOC](index.html) * [Next : 3.5.Â Project Relationships](pom-relationships-sect-project-relationships.html)  3.4.Â Project Dependencies   Maven can manage both internal and external dependencies. An external dependency for a Java project might be a library such as Plexus, the Spring Framework, or Log4J. An internal dependency is illustrated by a web application project depending on another project that contains service classes, model objects, or persistence logic. [Project Dependencies](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-dependency "Project Dependencies") shows some examples of project dependencies.  **Project Dependencies.Â**  ``` <project>     ...     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.codehaus.xfire</groupId>             <artifactId>xfire-java5</artifactId>             <version>1.2.5</version>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>junit</groupId>             <artifactId>junit</artifactId>             <version>3.8.1</version>             <scope>test</scope>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>             <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>             <version>2.4</version>             <scope>provided</scope>         </dependency>     </dependencies>     ... </project> ```    The first dependency is a compile dependency on the XFire SOAP library from Codehaus. You would use this type of dependency if your project depended on this library for compilation, testing, and during execution. The second dependency is a `test`-scoped dependency on JUnit. You would use a `test`-scoped dependency when you need to reference this library only during testing. The last dependency in [Project Dependencies](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-dependency "Project Dependencies") is a dependency on the Servlet 2.4 API. The last dependency is scoped as a provided dependency. You would use a provided scope when the application you are developing needs a library for compilation and testing, but this library is supplied by a container at runtime.  3.4.1.Â Dependency Scope   [Project Dependencies](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-dependency "Project Dependencies") briefly introduced three of the five dependency scopes: `compile`, `test`, and `provided`. Scope controls which dependencies are available in which classpath, and which dependencies are included with an application. Letâs explore each scope in detail:  compile   `compile` is the default scope; all dependencies are `compile`-scoped if a scope is not supplied. `compile` dependencies are available in all classpaths, and they are packaged.  provided   `provided` dependencies are used when you expect the JDK or a container to provide them. For example, if you were developing a web application, you would need the Servlet API available on the compile classpath to compile a servlet, but you wouldnât want to include the Servlet API in the packaged WAR; the Servlet API JAR is supplied by your application server or servlet container. `provided` dependencies are available on the compilation classpath (not runtime). They are not transitive, nor are they packaged.  runtime   `runtime` dependencies are required to execute and test the system, but they are not required for compilation. For example, you may need a JDBC API JAR at compile time and the JDBC driver implementation only at runtime.  test   `test`-scoped dependencies are not required during the normal operation of an application, and they are available only during test compilation and execution phases.  system   The `system` scope is similar to `provided` except that you have to provide an explicit path to the JAR on the local file system. This is intended to allow compilation against native objects that may be part of the system libraries. The artifact is assumed to always be available and is not looked up in a repository. If you declare the scope to be `system`, you must also provide the `systemPath` element. Note that this scope is not recommended (you should always try to reference dependencies in a public or custom Maven repository).     3.4.2.Â Optional Dependencies   Assume that you are working on a library that provides caching behavior. Instead of writing a caching system from scratch, you want to use some of the existing libraries that provide caching on the file system and distributed caches. Also assume that you want to give the end user an option to cache on the file system or to use an in-memory distributed cache. To cache on the file system, youâll want to use a freely available library called EHCache (<http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/>), and to cache in a distributed in-memory cache, you want to use another freely available caching library named SwarmCache ( <http://swarmcache.sourceforge.net/> ). Youâll code an interface and create a library that can be configured to use either EHCache or SwarmCache, but you want to avoid adding a dependency on both caching libraries to any project that depends on your library.  In other words, you need both libraries to compile this library project, but you donât want both libraries to show up as transitive runtime dependencies for the project that uses your library. You can accomplish this by using optional dependencies as shown in [Declaring Optional Dependencies](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-optional-depend "Declaring Optional Dependencies").  **Declaring Optional Dependencies.Â**  ``` <project>     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>     <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>     <version>1.0.0</version>     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>net.sf.ehcache</groupId>             <artifactId>ehcache</artifactId>             <version>1.4.1</version>             <optional>true</optional>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>swarmcache</groupId>             <artifactId>swarmcache</artifactId>             <version>1.0RC2</version>             <optional>true</optional>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>log4j</groupId>             <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>             <version>1.2.13</version>         </dependency>     </dependencies> </project> ```    Since youâve declared these dependencies as optional in `my-project`, if youâve defined a project that depends on `my-project` which needs those dependencies, youâll have to include them explicitly in the project that depends on `my-project`. For example, if you were writing an application which depended on `my-project` and wanted to use the EHCache implementation, you would need to add the following `dependency` element to your project.  ``` <project>     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>     <artifactId>my-application</artifactId>     <version>1.0.0</version>     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>             <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>             <version>1.0.0</version>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>net.sf.ehcache</groupId>             <artifactId>ehcache</artifactId>             <version>1.4.1</version>         </dependency>     </dependencies> </project> ```  In an ideal world, you wouldnât have to use optional dependencies. Instead of having one large project with a series of optional dependencies, you would separate the EHCache-specific code to a `my-project-ehcache` submodule and the SwarmCache-specific code to a `my-project-swarmcache` submodule. This way, instead of requiring projects that reference `my-project` to specifically add a dependency, projects can just reference a particular implementation project and benefit from the transitive dependency.  3.4.3.Â Dependency Version Ranges   Instead of a specific version for each dependency, you can alternatively specify a range of versions that would satisfy a given dependency. For example, you can specify that your project depends on version 3.8 or greater of JUnit, or anything between versions 4.5 and 4.10 of JUnit. You do this by surrounding one or more version numbers with the following characters:  (, )   Exclusive quantifiers  [, ]   Inclusive quantifiers    For example, if you wished to access any `JUnit` version greater than or equal to 3.8 but less than 4.0, your dependency would be as shown in [Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit 3.8 - JUnit 4.0](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-dep-range "Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit 3.8 - JUnit 4.0").  **Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit 3.8 - JUnit 4.0.Â**  ``` <dependency>     <groupId>junit</groupId>     <artifactId>junit</artifactId>     <version>[3.8,4.0)</version>     <scope>test</scope> </dependency> ```    If you want to depend on any version of JUnit no higher than 3.8.1, you would specify only an upper inclusive boundary, as shown in [Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit â 3.8.1](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-dep-range-2 "Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit â 3.8.1").  **Specifying a Dependency Range: JUnit â 3.8.1.Â**  ``` <dependency>     <groupId>junit</groupId>     <artifactId>junit</artifactId>     <version>[,3.8.1]</version>     <scope>test</scope> </dependency> ```    A version before or after the comma is not required, and means +/- infinity. For example, "[4.0,)" means any version greater than or equal to 4.0. "(,2.0)" is any version less than 2.0. "[1.2]" means only version 1.2, and nothing else. Note When declaring a "normal" version such as 3.8.2 for Junit, internally this is represented as "allow anything, but prefer 3.8.2." This means that when a conflict is detected, Maven is allowed to use the conflict algorithms to choose the best version. If you specify [3.8.2], it means that only 3.8.2 will be used and nothing else. If somewhere else there is a dependency that specifies [3.8.1], you would get a build failure telling you of the conflict. We point this out to make you aware of the option, but use it sparingly and only when really needed. The preferred way to resolve this is via `dependencyManagement`.   3.4.4.Â Transitive Dependencies   `project-a` depends on `project-b`, which in turn depends on `project-c`, then `project-c` is considered a transitive dependency of `project-a`. If `project-c` depended on `project-d`, then `project-d` would also be considered a transitive dependency of `project-a`. Part of Mavenâs appeal is that it can manage transitive dependencies and shield the developer from having to keep track of all of the dependencies required to compile and run an application. You can just depend on something like the Spring Framework and not have to worry about tracking down every last dependency of the Spring Framework.  Maven accomplishes this by building a graph of dependencies and dealing with any conflicts and overlaps that might occur. For example, if Maven sees that two projects depend on the same `groupId` and `artifactId`, it will sort out which dependency to use automatically, always favoring the more recent version of a dependency. Although this sounds convenient, there are some edge cases where transitive dependencies can cause some configuration issues. For these scenarios, you can use a dependency exclusion.  Transitive Dependencies and Scope   Each of the scopes outlined earlier in the section [SectionÂ 3.4.1, âDependency Scopeâ](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#pom-relationships-sect-dependency-scope "3.4.1.Â Dependency Scope") affects not just the scope of the dependency in the declaring project, but also how it acts as a transitive dependency. The easiest way to convey this information is through a table, as in [TableÂ 3.1, âHow Scope Affects Transitive Dependenciesâ](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#table-transitive-dep-and-scope "TableÂ 3.1.Â How Scope Affects Transitive Dependencies"). Scopes in the top row represent the scope of a transitive dependency. Scopes in the leftmost column represent the scope of a direct dependency. The intersection of the row and column is the scope that is assigned to a transitive dependency. A blank cell in this table means that the transitive dependency will be omitted.   **TableÂ 3.1.Â How Scope Affects Transitive Dependencies**         | Direct Scope | vs. Transitive Scope | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  | compile | provided | runtime | test | | compile | compile | - | runtime | - | | provided | provided | - | provided | - | | runtime | runtime | - | runtime | - | | test | test | - | test | - |      3.4.5.Â Conflict Resolution   There will be times when you need to exclude a transitive dependency, such as when you are depending on a project that depends on another project, but you would like to either exclude the dependency altogether or replace the transitive dependency with another dependency that provides the same functionality. [Excluding a Transitive Dependency](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-exclude "Excluding a Transitive Dependency") shows an example of a dependency element that adds a dependency on `project-a`, but excludes the transitive dependency `project-b`.  **Excluding a Transitive Dependency.Â**  ``` <dependency>     <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>     <artifactId>project-a</artifactId>     <version>1.0</version>     <exclusions>         <exclusion>             <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>             <artifactId>project-b</artifactId>         </exclusion>     </exclusions> </dependency> ```    Often, you will want to replace a transitive dependency with another implementation. For example, if you are depending on a library that depends on the Sun JTA API, you may want to replace the declared transitive dependency. Hibernate is one example. Hibernate depends on the Sun JTA API JAR, which is not available in the central Maven repository because it cannot be freely redistributed. Fortunately, the Apache Geronimo project has created an independent implementation of this library that can be freely redistributed. To replace a transitive dependency with another dependency, you would exclude the transitive dependency and declare a dependency on the project you wanted instead. [Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-exclude-replace "Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency") shows an example of a such replacement.  **Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency.Â**  ``` <dependencies>     <dependency>         <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>         <artifactId>hibernate</artifactId>         <version>3.2.5.ga</version>         <exclusions>             <exclusion>                 <groupId>javax.transaction</groupId>                 <artifactId>jta</artifactId>             </exclusion>         </exclusions>     </dependency>     <dependency>         <groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId>         <artifactId>geronimo-jta_1.1_spec</artifactId>         <version>1.1</version>     </dependency> </dependencies> ```    In [Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-exclude-replace "Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency"), there is nothing marking the dependency on geronimo-jta\_1.1\_spec as a replacement, it just happens to be a library which provides the same API as the original JTA dependency. Here are some other reasons you might want to exclude or replace transitive dependencies:   1. The `groupId` or `artifactId` of the artifact has changed, where the    current project requires an alternately named version from a    dependencyâs version - resulting in 2 copies of the same project in    the classpath. Normally Maven would capture this conflict and use a    single version of the project, but when `groupId` or `artifactId`    are different, Maven will consider this to be two different    libraries. 2. An artifact is not used in your project and the transitive    dependency has not been marked as an optional dependency. In this    case, you might want to exclude a dependency because it isnât    something your system needs and you are trying to cut down on the    number of libraries distributed with an application. 3. An artifact which is provided by your runtime container thus should    not be included with your build. An example of this is if a    dependency depends on something like the Servlet API and you want to    make sure that the dependency is not included in a web applicationâs    *WEB-INF/lib* directory. 4. To exclude a dependency which might be an API with multiple    implementations. This is the situation illustrated by    [Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency](pom-relationships-sect-project-dependencies.html#ex-exclude-replace "Excluding and Replacing a Transitive Dependency"); there is a Sun API which requires click-wrap    licensing and a time-consuming manual install into a custom    repository (Sunâs JTA JAR) versus a freely distributed version of    the same API available in the central Maven repository (Geronimoâs    JTA implementation).  ====    Dependency Management  Once youâve adopted Maven at your super complex enterprise and you have two hundred and twenty inter-related Maven projects, you are going to start wondering if there is a better way to get a handle on dependency versions. If every single project that uses a dependency like the MySQL Java connector needs to independently list the version number of the dependency, you are going to run into problems when you need to upgrade to a new version. Because the version numbers are distributed throughout your project tree, you are going to have to manually edit each of the *pom.xml* files that reference a dependency to make sure that you are changing the version number everywhere. Even with `find`, `xargs`, and `awk`, you are still running the risk of missing a single POM.  Luckily, Maven provides a way for you to consolidate dependency version numbers in the `dependencyManagement` element. Youâll usually see the `dependencyManagement` element in a top-level parent POM for an organization or project. Using the `dependencyManagement` element in a *pom.xml* allows you to reference a dependency in a child project without having to explicitly list the version. Maven will walk up the parent-child hierarchy until it finds a project with a `dependencyManagement` element, it will then use the version specified in this `dependencyManagement` element.  For example, if you have a large set of projects which make use of the MySQL Java connector version 5.1.2, you could define the following `dependencyManagement` element in your multi-module projectâs top-level POM.  **Defining Dependency Versions in a Top-level POM.Â**  ``` <project>     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>     <artifactId>a-parent</artifactId>     <version>1.0.0</version>     ...     <dependencyManagement>         <dependencies>             <dependency>                 <groupId>mysql</groupId>                 <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>                 <version>5.1.2</version>                 <scope>runtime</scope>             </dependency>             ...             <dependencies>     </dependencyManagement> ```    Then, in a child project, you can add a dependency to the MySQL Java Connector using the following dependency XML:  ``` <project>     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>     <parent>         <groupId>org.sonatype.mavenbook</groupId>         <artifactId>a-parent</artifactId>         <version>1.0.0</version>     </parent>     <artifactId>project-a</artifactId>     ...     <dependencies>         <dependency>             <groupId>mysql</groupId>             <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>         </dependency>     </dependencies> </project> ```  You should notice that the child project did not have to explicitly list the version of the `mysql-connector-java` dependency. Because this dependency was defined in the top-level POMâs dependencyManagement element, the version number is going to propagate to the child projectâs dependency on `mysql-connector-java`. Note that if this child project did define a version, it would override the version listed in the top-level POMâs `dependencyManagement` section. That is, the `dependencyManagement` version is only used when the child does not declare a version directly.  Dependency management in a top-level POM is different from just defining a dependency on a widely shared parent POM. For starters, all dependencies are inherited. If `mysql-connector-java` were listed as a dependency of the top-level parent project, every single project in the hierarchy would have a reference to this dependency. Instead of adding in unnecessary dependencies, using `dependencyManagement` allows you to consolidate and centralize the management of dependency versions without adding dependencies which are inherited by all children. In other words, the `dependencyManagement` element is equivalent to an environment variable which allows you to declare a dependency anywhere below a project without specifying a version number.   * [Prev : 3.3.Â POM Syntax](pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html) * [TOC](index.html) * [Next : 3.5.Â Project Relationships](pom-relationships-sect-project-relationships.html) |
