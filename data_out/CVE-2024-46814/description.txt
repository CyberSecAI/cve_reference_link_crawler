In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check msg_id before processing transcation

[WHY & HOW]
HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_INVALID (-1) is not a valid msg_id nor is it a valid
array index, and it needs checking before used.

This fixes 4 OVERRUN issues reported by Coverity.
