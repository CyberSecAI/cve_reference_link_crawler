- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer in the MAC address parser.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient bounds checking in the MAC address parser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can cause potential memory corruptions, leading to a thread crash on an affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the MAC address parser, and requires an authenticated attacker with administrator privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
