- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pagination=none` parameter, intended for the Tree API, was unintentionally also applicable to branches and tags endpoints due to the use of `Gitlab::Pagination::GitalyKeysetPager`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation and authorization. The system did not restrict the `pagination=none` parameter to its intended API, thus bypassing pagination limits.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the ability to fetch all branches/tags at once, potentially overwhelming the server with a large number of results.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP request to the branches or tags API endpoints with the `pagination=none` parameter set.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab instance and be able to make API requests to the affected endpoints.
