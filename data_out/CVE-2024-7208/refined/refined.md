The provided content is related to CVE-2024-7208 and provides details about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient verification of the authenticated sender against allowed domain identities in multi-tenant hosted SMTP services. This allows an authenticated user of one domain to spoof the identity of a sender from a different domain hosted by the same provider.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper verification between the authenticated sender and the allowed domain identities.
-  Circumvention of DMARC, SPF, and DKIM policies due to the above weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can spoof the sender's identity, sending emails that appear to be from a different domain hosted on the same service.
- The spoofed emails can bypass DMARC policies, making them appear legitimate to receiving email servers. This can lead to phishing or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via SMTP.
- The attacker must be an authenticated user or on a trusted network allowed by the email hosting provider.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate with the vulnerable SMTP service.
- The attacker needs to be a user of one of the hosted domains of the vulnerable email service provider.
