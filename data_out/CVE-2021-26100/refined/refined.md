- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing cryptographic step in FortiMail's Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control due to a missing cryptographic step that leads to unauthenticated encryption manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who intercepts encrypted messages can manipulate them to recover the plaintext without authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Interception and manipulation of encrypted messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept FortiMail IBE encrypted messages. No authentication is required.
