| I was going to take a look at this due to the CVE. [@GoldBinocle](https://github.com/GoldBinocle) I'm not sure I completely understand your POC; are you fuzzing the response from the test server to trigger the error in the client? [@stephane](https://github.com/stephane) probably understands all this better than I do but I'll try to help if I can. |

| Doesn't this issue just boil down to this line in the unit test?  rc = modbus\_read\_bits(ctx, UT\_BITS\_ADDRESS, UT\_BITS\_NB + 1, tab\_rp\_bits);  The buffer tab\_rp\_bits was been allocated to be UT\_BITS\_NB and the caller is lying and saying it is allocated for UT\_BITS\_NB + 1. So of course the buffer can overflow, because the caller lied about the length in the first place. So when the server returns a bunch of data and it is processed, the loop in the client fills more bytes than there is space. IMO this is not a bug in the implementation, rather it is a bug in the unit test and user error for not ensuring the size of the buffer matches with its actual size. |
