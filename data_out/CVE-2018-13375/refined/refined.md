Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of DHCP HOSTNAME parameters. Malicious scripts embedded within the HOSTNAME field of a DHCP request are not properly neutralized by FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager. This allows for the execution of the scripts when the logs are viewed through the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. The malicious script in the DHCP hostname is stored in the logs and then executed when a user views those logs in the FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands within the context of a user viewing the logs in FortiAnalyzer or FortiManager. This means the attacker could potentially perform actions on the FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager system based on the permission of the logged in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **DHCP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a DHCP request with a malicious script embedded within the HOSTNAME parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DHCP requests to the network where the vulnerable FortiAnalyzer or FortiManager is logging DHCP traffic. This likely requires the attacker to be on the same network segment or be able to influence DHCP traffic directed at the affected Forti products.
*  **No authentication required:** The attack does not require authentication to the FortiAnalyzer/FortiManager, only the ability to send a DHCP request with the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** FortiAnalyzer and FortiManager versions 5.6.0 and below.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to FortiAnalyzer 5.6.1 or above, or FortiManager 5.6.1 or above to remediate the issue.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
* **CVSS Score:** 5.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:X)
