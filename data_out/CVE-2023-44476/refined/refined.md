Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress CopyRightPro plugin (versions <= 2.1) lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: This allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions on the website without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions that can be triggered by CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious link or HTML form that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in user, would send a request to the vulnerable website.
- This request would be authenticated with the user's session, tricking the server into believing the user intentionally performed the action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form. This could be achieved through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other social engineering techniques.
