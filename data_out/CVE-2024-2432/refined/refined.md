- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition exists in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows, allowing a local user to potentially execute programs with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management (CWE-269) leading to a local privilege escalation. The vulnerability relies on a race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local user to execute programs with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a local user on a vulnerable Windows system and must be able to exploit the race condition. The attack has a high complexity due to the race condition.
