For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#ds) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-mult-vuln-CbVp4SUR>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products CVE-2022-20827 and CVE-2022-20841 affect the following Cisco products:    + RV160 VPN Routers   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV260 VPN Routers   + RV260P VPN Routers with PoE   + RV260W Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Routers CVE-2022-20842 affects the following Cisco products:    + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Routers   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Routers For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The vulnerabilities are dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities may be required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows:  **CVE-2022-20842:** **Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwc00210](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc00210)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20842Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2022-20827: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Web Filter Database Update Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web filter database update feature of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection and execute commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the web filter database update feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwb58268](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb58268), [CSCwb58273](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb58273)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20827Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.0CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2022-20841:** **Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Open Plug and Play Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the Open Plug and Play (PnP) module of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must leverage a man-in-the-middle position or have an established foothold on a specific network device that is connected to the affected router.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwb98961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb98961), [CSCwb98964](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb98964)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20841Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in the following table(s):  **CVE-2022-20827** **and** **CVE-2022-20841**       | Cisco Product | Affected Releases | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | RV160 and RV260 Series Routers | Earlier than 1.0.01.05 | Not vulnerable |   | RV160 and RV260 Series Routers | 1.0.01.05 | 1.0.01.09 |   | RV340 and RV345 Series Routers | Earlier than 1.0.03.26 | Not vulnerable |   | RV340 and RV345 Series Routers | 1.0.03.26 | 1.0.03.28 |       **CVE-2022-20842**       | Cisco Product | Affected Releases | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | RV340 and RV345 Series Routers | 1.0.03.26 and earlier | 1.0.03.28 |       The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.
