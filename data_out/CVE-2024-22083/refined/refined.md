- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A hardcoded backdoor session ID exists within the Elspec G5 digital fault recorder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded backdoor session ID.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The hardcoded session ID can be used by an attacker for unauthorized access to the device, potentially allowing reconfiguration and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to be able to communicate with the device and use the hardcoded session ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Elspec G5 digital fault recorder.
