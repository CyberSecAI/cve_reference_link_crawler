{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `log` function uses `vsnprintf` with a format string controlled by user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Format string injection vulnerability in UPnP logging functionality.",
    "Misuse of the `log` function in multiple locations within the UPnP functionality of the Abode `iota`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, information disclosure, and denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious UPnP service can be hosted by an attacker to trigger the vulnerabilities. The attacker needs to be able to listen for and reply to M-SEARCH packets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same network and able to send and receive UPnP messages.",
  "Additional Details": "The specific vulnerable instances are:\n  - CVE-2022-35878: `DoEnumUPnPService` action, using the `ST` and `Location` fields from the M-SEARCH reply.\n  - CVE-2022-35879: `DoUpdateUPnPbyService` action, using the `controlURL` field from the device description.\n  - CVE-2022-35880: `DoUpdateUPnPbyService` action, using the `NewInternalClient` field in a SOAP response to a `GetSpecificPortMappingEntry` request.\n  - CVE-2022-35881: `DoUpdateUPnPbyService` action, using the `errorCode` and `errorDescription` fields in a SOAP response to an `AddPortMapping` request.\nExploitation requires physical access to the device's UART console to see the log output."
