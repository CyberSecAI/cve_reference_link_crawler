# Session fixation vulnerability through cookie injection

Moderate

[bernd](/bernd)
published
GHSA-3xf8-g8gr-g7rh
Feb 7, 2024

## Package

maven

graylog2-server
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

4.3.0 - 5.2.3

## Patched versions

5.1.11, 5.2.4

## Description

### Impact

Reauthenticating with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id, even if for different user credentials.

In this case, the pre-existing session could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login session, provided the malicious user could successfully inject their session cookie into someone else's browser.

The complexity of such an attack is high, because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser, potentially through an XSS attack. No such attack has been discovered.

### Patches

Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, and any versions of the 6.0 development branch contain patches to not re-use sessions under any circumstances, making this type of attack impossible.

### Workarounds

Using short session expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists, but is relatively hard to exploit.

A proxy could be leveraged to clear the `authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the `/api/system/sessions` endpoint, as that is the only one vulnerable.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
