The provided content is related to CVE-2023-52728.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to unchecked array index access within the ASN1 APER decoding and encoding functions. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `parseAlignBits` function during decoding and in the `putBitString` function during encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Index out-of-range vulnerability:** The `parseAlignBits` function attempts to access a slice using an index that can exceed the slice's bounds, leading to a panic. This occurs when aligning bits during the decoding process.
- **Index out-of-range vulnerability:** The `putBitString` function exhibits a similar issue when it attempts to access an element of a slice using an out-of-range index during the encoding process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can cause the application (E2T) to crash, leading to a denial of service. The provided logs show that the application panics and terminates when these out-of-range accesses occur. This disruption can impact the availability and functionality of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are related to malformed or crafted ASN1 APER encoded data.
- **Decoding:** By providing a specially crafted ASN1 APER message, an attacker can trigger the index out-of-range error in `parseAlignBits`, causing a crash during decoding.
- **Encoding:** By providing specific input that leads to an empty bitstring in `putBitString`, an attacker can cause a crash during the encoding process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Decoding:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate the ASN1 APER encoded data being processed by the vulnerable `parseAlignBits` function. This suggests the attacker has some ability to inject messages into the data stream of the affected application.
- **Encoding:** The attacker needs to be able to provide specific input to trigger an issue in `putBitString` during encoding.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was discovered during testing of the `onos-lib-go` library version 0.10.24 and affects both the decoding and encoding processes.
- The logs provided in the issue report clearly show the panic caused by the index out-of-range access in both `parseAlignBits` and `putBitString`.
- The affected functions are located in the following files:
  - `pkg/asn1/aper/aper.go` (for `parseAlignBits`)
  - `pkg/asn1/aper/marshal.go` (for `putBitString`)
