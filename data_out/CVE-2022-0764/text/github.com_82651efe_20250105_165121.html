| Bug reportDescribe the bug There is a security vulnerability in Strapi that prevents our deployment pipeline from running. There is already a fix implemented for v4.x, but upgrading is not on our short-term road map for now. It seems like the fix from v4 can be copied to v3 1 on 1, but since I've never contributed to this repository I was hoping there was someone willing to back-port the fix to v3. Other information  * Vulnerability on nist.gov: [CVE-2022-0764](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0764) * Explanation on huntr.dev: <https://huntr.dev/bounties/001d1c29-805a-4035-93bb-71a0e81da3e5/> * Commit to v4 that fixes the issue: [2a3f5e9](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/commit/2a3f5e988be6a2c7dae5ac22b9e86d579b462f4c) |

| Hi [@timyboy12345](https://github.com/timyboy12345) sorry I am not able to reproduce the issue described on [huntr](https://huntr.dev/bounties/001d1c29-805a-4035-93bb-71a0e81da3e5/) for Strapi version 3.x.  The security issue was introduced in v4.0.0 when we changed how we create projects with starters and templates via the CLI and fixed in v4.1.1. I believe it only exists between these versions.  Please let me know if I’ve missed something and I will fix it ASAP. |

| I see. The record in the NVD states that all versions before 4.1.0 were impacted, including v3.x.x, meaning it gets flagged in `yarn audit`.  I've created a ticket with NIST asking them to change this, hopefully resulting in versions greater than 4.0.0-alpha.2 and smaller than 4.1.0 being flagged. |
