**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Project Access Token (PAT) rotate API, which allows a project maintainer to rotate a PAT created by a project owner. This rotation generates a new token that inherits the owner role, even when the maintainer does not have owner privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Privilege escalation: A project maintainer can elevate their privileges to that of a project owner.
- Improper access control: The PAT rotate API doesn't properly validate the user's permission before allowing the token rotation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious project maintainer can use the rotated token to perform actions that are only permitted to project owners. This may include sensitive actions such as changing settings, modifying code, accessing data, deleting project artifacts, or affecting other project members.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be a project maintainer in the target project.
- The attacker must know the ID of a PAT created by a project owner with the "Owner" role.
- The attacker uses the PAT rotate API to generate a new token with owner permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must have Maintainer role in the GitLab project.
- Must have a personal access token with API scope.
- Must be able to use the GitLab API.
