| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1891685#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-10-27 04:44:10 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  winbind in version 3.6 and later implements a request to translate multiple Windows SIDs into names in one request. This was done for performance reasons: The Microsoft RPC call domain controllers offer to do this translation offer this batch operation, so it was an obvious extension to also offer this batch operation on the winbind unix domain stream socket that is available to local processes on the Samba server.  Due to improper input validation a hand-crafted packet can make winbind perform a NULL pointer dereference and thus crash.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1891685#c1)  Huzaifa S.
