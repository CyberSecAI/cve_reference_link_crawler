Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2914:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a section specifically detailing "CVE-2018-2914: Unauthenticated Remote Denial of Service" in the Tenable advisory. This confirms that the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the Oracle GoldenGate Manager software. This occurs when the software receives a malformed `REPORT` command. The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the `REPORT` command is sent but it's incomplete.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, leading to a crash. This vulnerability exists in the handling of the `REPORT` command within the Oracle GoldenGate Manager.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit leads to the termination (crash) of the Oracle GoldenGate Manager process, causing a denial of service. This disrupts the monitoring, controlling, and reporting functionality of GoldenGate.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted command over the network via TCP.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any authentication.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system running the vulnerable Oracle GoldenGate Manager service.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to trigger this vulnerability, making it easier to exploit.
*   **Command Injection:**  The attacker needs to send a malformed command, specifically an incomplete `REPORT` command.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `check_messages` function.
*   The stack trace shows the crash occurs while processing the incomplete `REPORT` command, and `strtol` function is called on NULL.
* The vulnerable versions are Oracle GoldenGate Manager 12.1.2.1.0, 12.2.0.2.0, and 12.3.0.1.0

**Additional Notes:**

The Tenable advisory provides a clear proof-of-concept Python script that demonstrates how an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending an incomplete REPORT command with a preceding name. The Oracle advisory also confirms this issue.
