The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a relative path traversal issue in the File Manager component of Pandora FMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Relative path traversal
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The relative path traversal can lead to Remote Code Execution.
- Stored XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the File Manager, which can be executed when other users access it. This can lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The relative path traversal is exploited through the File Manager.
- Stored XSS is injected by manipulating file manager functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- To exploit the relative path traversal, an attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate file paths within the File Manager.
- To exploit stored XSS, an attacker needs the ability to create or modify files or entries within the File Manager.

**Additional Notes:**
- The table shows two entries for CVE-2022-1648, one with "Stored Cross Site-Scripting" and the other with "Relative Path Traversal to Remote Code Execution", which may indicate that there are two distinct issues under the same CVE ID, or a single issue with dual impact.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 762 for XSS and 761 for the RCE aspect.
