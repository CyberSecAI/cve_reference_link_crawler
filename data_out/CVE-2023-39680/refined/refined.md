- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The Unicopia mod for Minecraft performs unsafe Java deserialization when a user's client connects to a malicious server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsafe Java deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H) according to CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N). A malicious server can send crafted data to the client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control or have a malicious Minecraft server that the victim's client connects to. Exploitation requires user interaction (UI:R) since the user needs to connect to the malicious server. The attack complexity is high (AC:H). No privileges are needed (PR:N).
