## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Frontend Checklist <= 2.3.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Items

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a checklist and for an item, enter `<script>alert(999)</script>`
2. Display the checklist via shortcode and view on the frontend to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
