- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape certain shortcode attributes before using them in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a malicious shortcode in the `shortcode` parameter using the `action=parse-media-shortcode` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to exploit this vulnerability.
