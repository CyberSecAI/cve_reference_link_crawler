Debian Bug     : 1008010 1016978 1055852

Several vulnerabilities have been found in frr, the FRRouting suite of
internet protocols. An attacker could craft packages to trigger buffer
overflows with the possibility to gain remote code execution, buffer
overreads, crashes or trick the software to enter an infinite loop.

CVE-2022-26125

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.

CVE-2022-26126

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    the use of strdup with a non-zero-terminated binary string in
    isis_nb_notifications.c.

CVE-2022-26127

    A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin
    function in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-26128

    A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin
    function in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-26129

    Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to
    wrong checks on the subtlv length in the functions, parse_hello_subtlv,
    parse_ihu_subtlv, and parse_update_subtlv in babeld/message.c.

CVE-2022-37035

    An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) 8.3. In
    bgp_notify_send_with_data() and bgp_process_packet() in bgp_packet.c,
    there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could
    lead to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure by sending
    crafted BGP packets. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

CVE-2023-38406

    bgpd/bgp_flowspec.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.4.3 mishandles an nlri
    length of zero, aka a "flowspec overflow."

CVE-2023-38407

    bgpd/bgp_label.c in FRRouting (FRR) before 8.5 attempts to read beyond
    the end of the stream during labeled unicast parsing.

CVE-2023-46752

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. It mishandles
    malformed MP_REACH_NLRI data, leading to a crash.

CVE-2023-46753

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. A crash can
    occur for a crafted BGP UPDATE message without mandatory attributes,
    e.g., one with only an unknown transit attribute.

CVE-2023-47234

    An issue was discovered in bgpd in FRRouting (FRR) 8.3. In
    bgp_notify_send_with_data() and bgp_process_packet() in bgp_packet.c,
    there is a possible use-after-free due to a race condition. This could
    lead to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure by sending
    crafted BGP packets. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

CVE-2023-47235

    An issue was discovered in FRRouting FRR through 9.0.1. A crash can
    occur when a malformed BGP UPDATE message with an EOR is processed,
    because the presence of EOR does not lead to a treat-as-withdraw
    outcome.

CVE-2024-31948

    In FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1, an attacker using a malformed Prefix SID
    attribute in a BGP UPDATE packet can cause the bgpd daemon to crash.

CVE-2024-31949

    In FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1, an infinite loop can occur when
    receiving a MP/GR capability as a dynamic capability because malformed
    data results in a pointer not advancing.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.5.1-1.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your frr packages.

bgpd: Ignore handling NLRIs if we received MP\_UNREACH\_NLRI

```
If we receive MP_UNREACH_NLRI, we should stop handling remaining NLRIs if
no mandatory path attributes received.

In other words, if MP_UNREACH_NLRI received, the remaining NLRIs should be handled
as a new data, but without mandatory attributes, it's a malformed packet.

In normal case, this MUST not happen at all, but to avoid crashing bgpd, we MUST
handle that.
