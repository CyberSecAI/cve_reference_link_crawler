Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2016-5549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a timing attack vulnerability in the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) implementation within the Java libraries. Specifically, it affects how ECDSA signatures are processed, making it possible to reveal information about the private key through analysis of the execution time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Attack:** The vulnerability is a timing side-channel, which means the attacker exploits variations in execution time to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **ECDSA Implementation:** The specific weakness resides within the implementation of ECDSA, making it susceptible to timing analysis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Private Key Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially extract the private key associated with an ECDSA signature. This enables an attacker to impersonate the legitimate user or entity that owns the key.
*   **Compromised Authentication:** If the private key is compromised, the attacker could then create fraudulent signatures, allowing them to impersonate or breach systems that use ECDSA for authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network because the timing information can potentially be observed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests that invoke ECDSA signature operations on the vulnerable system.
*  **Timing analysis**: The attacker needs to be capable of measuring and analyzing the time taken by the system to compute the ECDSA signature

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   This CVE is often bundled with other Java vulnerabilities, which were all patched in the same update. This indicates that the identified issue was part of a broader security review of the Java platform.
* Multiple vendors, including Oracle, Red Hat, and Gentoo, released security advisories and patches to address this along with the other related Java vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the multiple RHSA and GLSA entries.
* The vulnerability affects multiple NetApp products and is listed as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in NetApp advisory NTAP-20170119-0001.
*   The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Java SE, including 6, 7 and 8, highlighting that this issue persisted across multiple Java releases and indicating the wide impact of this security flaw.
* The severity is rated as 'Critical' or 'High' in multiple advisories, indicating a significant risk.
* The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and can lead to sensitive information disclosure (Private Key).

In summary, CVE-2016-5549 represents a serious cryptographic vulnerability that arises from timing differences in the ECDSA implementation. Exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise a system's security by obtaining a private key.
