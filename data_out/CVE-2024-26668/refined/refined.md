The provided content relates to CVE-2024-26668.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from integer overflows within the netfilter nft_limit module during the initialization of rate-limiting configurations. Specifically, when calculating the token bucket size, arithmetic operations involving rate, burst, and unit values can result in an overflow, leading to an incorrect token counter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow during calculation of `priv->nsecs`, `rate_with_burst` and `tokens`.
- Incorrect rate limiting due to the integer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Incorrect rate-limiting behavior, potentially leading to traffic exceeding the intended limits.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing very large rate, burst, or unit values when configuring netfilter rules using `nft_limit`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to configure netfilter rules.
- This usually requires root or administrative privileges.
