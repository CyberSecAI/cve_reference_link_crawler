Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The School-Management-System application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `/unitmarks.php` endpoint, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation. The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or gain unauthorized access to the database server.
*   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/unitmarks.php` endpoint by manipulating the `medium`, `class`, `section`, `test`, and `subject` parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No specific privileges are mentioned as a requirement to exploit the vulnerability, however, having the session cookie `PHPSESSIDwebERPteam` might be necessary for a full-fledged attack. The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows a request originating from a browser, suggesting it could be a remote attack.
