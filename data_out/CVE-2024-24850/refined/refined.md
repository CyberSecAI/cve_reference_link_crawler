- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to a broken access control vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.  Specifically, the plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functions or actions, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions they should not be authorized to do. The specific impact is not specified, but it generally leads to unauthorized modification of data or system behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to a vulnerable function or action within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability; it can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
