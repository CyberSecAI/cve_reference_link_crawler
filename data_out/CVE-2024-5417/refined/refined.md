- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them, leading to the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A user with contributor role or higher can inject malicious code through the plugin's block options while in code editor mode within a post. The XSS payload is triggered when the post is previewed or viewed by any user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least the contributor role within the WordPress site. They must be able to create or edit posts using the code editor.
