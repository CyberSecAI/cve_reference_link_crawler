Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0586

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Essential Addons for Elementor" plugin, specifically within the Login/Register Element's custom login URL functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the custom login URL, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. These scripts are stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which execute whenever a user accesses those pages. This can lead to:
    - **Account compromise:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies or redirect users to phishing sites.
    - **Malware distribution:** Malicious scripts can be used to distribute malware to site visitors.
    - **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance or content of the affected page.
    - **Unauthorized actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Login/Register Element" of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the "custom login URL" input field is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level permissions or higher to access the vulnerable setting within the plugin.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the plugin up to and including 5.9.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.9.5 by implementing `sanitize_text_field` and `sanitize_url` on vulnerable fields.

**Changes Made in Version 5.9.5:**
The provided Trac changeset highlights the code changes made to fix the vulnerability, which include replacing instances of `wp_strip_all_tags` and unescaped output of various fields with `sanitize_text_field` and `sanitize_url`:
-   `$btn_text = ! empty( $this->ds['login_button_text'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $this->ds['login_button_text'] ) : '';`
-  `$lgn_link_action = ! empty( $this->ds['login_link_action'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $this->ds['login_link_action'] ) : 'form';`
- `$btn_text = ! empty( $this->ds['reg_button_text'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $this->ds['reg_button_text'] ) : '';`
- `$lgn_url  = ! empty( $this->ds['custom_login_url']['url'] ) ? sanitize_url( $this->ds['custom_login_url']['url'] ) : '';`
- `$btn_text  = ! empty( $this->ds['lostpassword_button_text'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $this->ds['lostpassword_button_text'] ) : '';`
-`value="<?php echo esc_attr( $btn_text ); ?>"/>`
- `$btn_text  = ! empty( $this->ds['resetpassword_button_text'] ) ? __( sanitize_text_field( $this->ds['resetpassword_button_text'] ), 'essential-addons-for-elementor-lite' ) : '';`

These changes ensure that user-provided input is properly sanitized before being outputted to the web page, thus preventing XSS attacks.
