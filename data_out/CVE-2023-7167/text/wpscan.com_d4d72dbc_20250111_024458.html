## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Persian Fonts <= 1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=persian-fonts%2Fpersian-fonts.php
2. In the textarea, add the payload: </textarea><script>alert(1)</script>
3. Click "Save changes" and see the XSS on reload

### Affects Plugins
