[`c0a9265`](/getkirby/kirby/commit/c0a92657515c90ca549fe14894cbe65a1ac99cc0)

## üö® Security release

### [User enumeration in the code-based login and password reset forms](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-43qq-qw4x-28f8)

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 4.8)

Errors that occur during the processing of the code-based login and password reset were in some cases passed to the user. This includes errors of the code challenge itself (e.g. if the email could not be sent) and errors thrown inside the `user.login:failed` hook.

This vulnerability allowed user enumeration, which is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation. This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.

This vulnerability only affects you if you are using the `code` or `password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option. It can only be successfully exploited under server configuration conditions outside of the attacker's control.

Thanks to Florian Merz ([@florianmrz](https://github.com/florianmrz)) of hatchery.io for responsibly reporting the identified issue.

### [User enumeration in the brute force protection](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f)

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 6.5)

We used the opportunity to review other parts of Kirby's authentication handling and found another part that is affected by a similar user enumeration vulnerability caused by a response discrepancy in Kirby's brute force protection system.

This vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be exploited for targeted attacks because the attack does not scale to brute force.

## Description

### TL;DR

This vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be exploited for targeted attacks because the attack does not scale to brute force.

---

### Introduction

User enumeration is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation. This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.

User enumeration attacks are performed by entering an existing and a non-existing user into the email address field of the login form. If the system returns a different response or behaves differently depending on whether the user exists, the attacker can enter unknown email addresses and use the different behavior as a clue for the (non-)existing user.

### Impact

Kirby comes with a built-in brute force protection. By default, it will prevent further login attempts after 10 failed logins from a single IP address or of a single existing user. After every failed login attempt, Kirby inserts a random delay between one millisecond and two seconds to make automated attacks harder and to avoid leaking whether the user exists. Unfortunately, this random delay was not inserted after the brute force limit was reached.

Because Kirby only tracks failed login attempts per email address for existing users but always tracks failed login attempts per IP address, this behavior could be abused by attackers for user enumeration. For this to work, an attacker would need to create login requests beyond the trials limit (which is 10 by default) from two or more IP addresses. After the trials limit was reached, the login form immediately blocked further requests for existing users, but not for invalid users.

This exploit does not scale to brute force attacks because of the delay during the first 10 requests per user, the faint difference between the responses for valid and invalid users and the fact that code-based logins would send an email for every login attempt, which makes the attack easy to spot. The vulnerability is therefore only relevant for targeted attacks.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2), [Kirby 3.6.6.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2), [Kirby 3.7.5.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1) and [Kirby 3.8.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.

In all of the mentioned releases, we have rewritten the affected code so that the delay is also inserted after the brute force limit is reached.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## üö® Security release

### [User enumeration in the code-based login and password reset forms](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-43qq-qw4x-28f8)

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 4.8)

Errors that occur during the processing of the code-based login and password reset were in some cases passed to the user. This includes errors of the code challenge itself (e.g. if the email could not be sent) and errors thrown inside the `user.login:failed` hook.

This vulnerability allowed user enumeration, which is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation. This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.

This vulnerability only affects you if you are using the `code` or `password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option. It can only be successfully exploited under server configuration conditions outside of the attacker's control.

Thanks to Florian Merz ([@florianmrz](https://github.com/florianmrz)) of hatchery.io for responsibly reporting the identified issue.

### [User enumeration in the brute force protection](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f)

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 6.5)

We used the opportunity to review other parts of Kirby's authentication handling and found another part that is affected by a similar user enumeration vulnerability caused by a response discrepancy in Kirby's brute force protection system.

This vulnerability affects all Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config). It can only be exploited for targeted attacks because the attack does not scale to brute force.
