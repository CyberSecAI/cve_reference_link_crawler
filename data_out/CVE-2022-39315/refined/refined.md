The provided content relates to CVE-2022-39315.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy in Kirby's brute force protection system. Specifically, after reaching the limit of failed login attempts, a random delay is not applied consistently. This inconsistent delay is the root cause of the user enumeration vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **User enumeration:** The system's behavior differs after reaching the brute force limit depending on whether the user exists. For existing users, further login requests are immediately blocked, whereas, for non-existing users, they are not. This difference in response time can be used to determine valid usernames.
- **Inconsistent rate-limiting:** The intended random delay mechanism to thwart brute-force attacks was not applied uniformly in all scenarios related to login attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **User enumeration:** Attackers can identify valid usernames within a Kirby installation by observing the different response times after the brute force limit is reached for existing and non-existing users.
- **Social engineering:** Enumerated user information can be used to craft targeted social engineering attacks.
- **Organizational structure revelation:** Attackers can gain insights into the organization by confirming user accounts, potentially revealing internal structure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through the login form.
- **Targeted attack:** This is a targeted attack rather than a large-scale brute-force effort due to the delay mechanisms in place for initial login requests and the relatively subtle differences in responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the login form:** The attacker must have network access to the login form of a Kirby instance.
- **Multiple IP addresses:** The attacker needs to make requests from multiple IP addresses to bypass the initial rate limits.
- **Ability to observe response times:** The attacker needs the ability to differentiate subtle response time differences from the server to distinguish between valid and invalid users.
