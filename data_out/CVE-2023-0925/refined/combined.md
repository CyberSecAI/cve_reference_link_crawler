## Manage complex integrations with ease

Integrate with cloud-based and on-premises applications, enabling rapid deployment and enhancing customer experiences. With IBM webMethods Integration you can:

Build anywhere, deploy anywhere

Use preferred tools (online or offline) to design and develop integrations—and deploy them anywhere, without having to build the same thing twice. Eliminate limitations to deliver amazing customer experiences quickly.

Centralize control

Monitor all global integrations through a single pane of glass. See and control all your runtimes and cross-platform integrations so you can debug faster and stick to your SLAs. Protect your multicloud and hybrid integrations with security your CSO will love.

Conquer complexity

Comply with regional data requirements by using local runtimes for your integrations, regardless of where they are hosted. Deploy faster and scale up or down in minutes with zero-footprint edge servers so you can move first in the market.

Use a single platform for all integrators

Avoid dropping balls while juggling integrations from different teams. Choose your own user interface—either advanced, low code or no code—and allow business and IT to work together on the same platform.

Hundreds of connectors

Take advantage of ready-to-use integration connectors for on prem or SaaS applications (along with hundreds of recipes to jump-start your progress) to connect without coding.

Single integration runtime

Reuse the services you build anywhere with a single integration runtime that can run any way you need—as a microservice, an on-prem integration, in a private cloud container or in public clouds. Do it reliably with a DevOps model that uses a repository for versioning and dependencies.

---

AI-enhanced interface

Empower new business users and developers to use an intuitive drag and drop UI with AI-enhanced mapping or a natural language UI to create new workflows. This smart, no-code approach builds error-free integrations faster.

---

Embeddable integration

Include integrations directly in the applications that your team is building to build better, more user-friendly products. Integrate data from more than 200 systems, apps and devices—without worrying about infrastructure.

---

Smoother cloud migration

Create and run integrations in a hybrid or multicloud environment for the duration that you need without ripping and replacing everything. That means you can move key applications to the cloud without worrying about breaking the services you’ve already built.
