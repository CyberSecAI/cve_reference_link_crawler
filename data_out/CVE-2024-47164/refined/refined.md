- Root cause of vulnerability: The `is_in_or_equal` function, designed to check if a file resides within a specific directory, can be bypassed using payloads with `..` (parent directory) sequences in file paths. This improper handling of `..` sequences allows attackers to potentially bypass directory traversal checks.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability due to the flawed implementation of the `is_in_or_equal` function, which doesn't properly sanitize and normalize file paths.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they can manipulate the file paths to bypass the intended directory access controls, particularly affecting Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation.
- Attack vectors: By crafting malicious file path strings with `..` sequences that are passed to the `is_in_or_equal` function.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attackers need to be able to influence file path inputs, for example during file uploads or other operations that use the `is_in_or_equal` function.
