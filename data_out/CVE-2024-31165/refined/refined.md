- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an unchecked return value within the `fluid_msg::of13::SetFieldAction::unpack` routine of the libfluid library. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unchecked return value leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A network attacker can trigger a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the vulnerable component.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks are possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable component and no specific privileges are required.
