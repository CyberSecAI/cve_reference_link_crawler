**Verification:**

The provided document contains an entry for `SVE-2023-0637(CVE-2023-30660)`, confirming that it is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Exposure of Sensitive Information vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the `getDefaultChipId` function within the `UwbAospAdapterService`. This function, prior to the patch, allowed local attackers to access the UWB (Ultra-Wideband) chipset identifier.
*  **Impact:** A local attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive hardware identifiers of the device (UWB chipset ID).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have local access to the device and the ability to invoke the vulnerable `getDefaultChipId` function in the `UwbAospAdapterService`.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android 12 and 13.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch implemented adds proper permission checks to prevent unauthorized access to the UWB chipset identifier.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**

CVE-2023-30660 is a moderate severity vulnerability where a local attacker can obtain sensitive UWB chipset information by invoking a vulnerable function in the `UwbAospAdapterService` before the fix was applied. The vulnerability is due to improper access control over the `getDefaultChipId` function, allowing unauthorized access to the UWB Chipset ID. The fix is implemented by adding permission check before accessing the identifier.
