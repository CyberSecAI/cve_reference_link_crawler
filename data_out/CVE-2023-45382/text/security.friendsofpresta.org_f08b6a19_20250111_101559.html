**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

In the module “SoNice Retour” (sonice\_retour) up to version 2.1.0 from Common-Services for PrestaShop, a guest can download personal information without restriction by performing a path traversal attack.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-45382](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45382)
* **Published at**: 2023-11-16
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: sonice\_retour
* **Impacted release**: <= 2.1.0 (2.2.20 fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Common-Services
* **Weakness**: [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
* **Severity**: high (7.5)

## Description

Due to a lack of permissions control and a lack of control in the path name construction, a guest can perform a path traversal to view all files on the information system.

Note : We are forced to tag it as a high gravity due to the CWE type 22 but be warned that on our ecosystem, it must be considered critical since it unlocks hundreds of admin’s ajax scripts of modules due to [this](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/6c05518b807d014ee8edb811041e3de232520c28/classes/Tools.php#L1247)

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: none
* **Availability**: none

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

## Possible malicious usage

* Stealing secrets to unlock admin controllers based on ajax script
* Exfiltrate all modules with all versions to facilitate pentesting
* Stealing table\_prefix to greatly facilitate SQL injections for kiddies who don’t know how to exploit DBMS design’s vulnerabilities or steal database access to login in exposed PHPMyAdmin/Adminer/etc.
* Bypass WAF / htaccess restrictions to read forbidden files (such as logs on predictable paths of banks’s modules inside /var/log/)

## Patch from 2.1.0

```
--- 2.1.0/modules/sonice_retour/functions/downloadLabel.php
+++ XXXXX/modules/sonice_retour/functions/downloadLabel.php
    public function action()
    {
-       $file = $_REQUEST['file'];
+       $file = basename($_REQUEST['file']);

```
## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the module **sonice\_retour**.
* You should consider restricting the access of modules/sonice\_retour/ to a whitelist
* NEVER expose a PHPMyAdmin / Adminer / etc without, at least, a htpasswd
* Activate OWASP 930’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall) and adjust it for your PrestaShop
