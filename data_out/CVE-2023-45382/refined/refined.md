- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module "SoNice Retour" lacks proper input validation and path sanitization when handling file download requests, specifically in the `downloadLabel.php` file. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path provided in the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Path Traversal (CWE-22)**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the file path requested by the user, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
    - **Lack of Permission Control:** No checks are performed to verify if the user has the right to download the file.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can potentially access any file on the server's file system, including sensitive configuration files, database credentials, module code, log files, and personal data.
    - **Bypass Access Controls**: Attackers can bypass intended restrictions, accessing files that should not be directly accessible via the web.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: It can lead to privilege escalation by exploiting other vulnerabilities using stolen secrets, SQL injection with the stolen table prefix, or login into exposed PHPMyAdmin/Adminer.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Network-based**: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with a manipulated file parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **Unauthenticated Access**: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs only a network connection to the vulnerable application.
