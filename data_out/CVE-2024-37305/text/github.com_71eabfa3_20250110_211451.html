# Buffer overflow in deserialization

## Package

oqs-provider

## Affected versions

<= 0.6.0

## Patched versions

latest "main" branch and releases > 0.6.0

## Description

oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs.

### Impact

Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with `DECODE_UINT32` at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage.

Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected.

### Patches

Fixed in v0.6.1.

### Workarounds

None; users must upgrade to v0.6.1.

### References

[#416](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416)

### Further details

`DECODE_UINT32` is called on user-provided input without any length checks and the decoded classical key lengths and signature lengths are later used for memory reads and writes without any (or very limited) control. This mainly occurs in `oqsx_key_op` and `oqs_sig_verify`, as they are provided `char *` user input. This is the most severe security issue as outsiders could cause crashes or information leakage by providing malformed input.

`DECODE_UINT32` is often used to load uint32 values into int's and other integer types, which could cause integer overflows and similar problems as above. This could also be easily exploited.

The patch fixing these problems also adds limited length checks where `DECODE_UINT32` is called on an `OQSX_KEY` hybrid key's private key or public key, just to make sure erroneous behavior is avoided.

### Credits

Thank you to Bence Mali, Gergely Nagy, and Zoltán Kővágó of Tresorit for identifying the issue and providing the patch to address it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
