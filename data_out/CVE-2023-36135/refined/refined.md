* **Direct Interaction:** The attacker directly interacts with the "Forgot Password" form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application.
* **Basic network access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system to send requests.

**Additional Details:**
