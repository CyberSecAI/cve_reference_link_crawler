| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2270115#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-03-18 13:44:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the RPC library APIs of libvirt. The RPC server de-serialization code allocates memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry points. Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function results in a crash due to the negative length being treated as a huge positive number. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2270115#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-03-21 08:59:32 UTC  ``` Created libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2270649](show_bug.cgi?id=2270649 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2024-2494 libvirt: negative g_new0 length can lead to unbounded memory allocation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2270115#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2024-03-21 09:00:26 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: [https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel@lists.libvirt.org/thread/BKRQXPLPC6B7FLHJXSBQYW7HNDEBW6RJ/](https://lists.libvirt.org/archives/list/devel%40lists.libvirt.org/thread/BKRQXPLPC6B7FLHJXSBQYW7HNDEBW6RJ/)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2270115#c4)  Daniel Berrangé    2024-03-21 09:22:29 UTC  ``` Upstream merged fix is  commit 8a3f8d957507c1f8223fdcf25a3ff885b15557f2 Author: Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange> Date:   Fri Mar 15 10:47:50 2024 +0000      remote: check for negative array lengths before allocation          While the C API entry points will validate non-negative lengths     for various parameters, the RPC server de-serialization code     will need to allocate memory for arrays before entering the C     API. These allocations will thus happen before the non-negative     length check is performed.          Passing a negative length to the g_new0 function will usually     result in a crash due to the negative length being treated as     a huge positive number.          This was found and diagnosed by ALT Linux Team with AFLplusplus.
