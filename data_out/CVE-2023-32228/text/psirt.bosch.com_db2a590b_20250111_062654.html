# Vulnerability in Wiegand card data interpretation

BOSCH-SA-391095-BT

## Advisory Information

* **Advisory ID:**  BOSCH-SA-391095-BT
* **CVE Numbers and CVSS v3.1 Scores:**
  + [CVE-2023-32228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32228)
    - Base Score:  [4.6 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
* **Published:**  24 May 2023
* **Last Updated:**  24 May 2023

## Summary

Bosch Access Control products AMC2-4WCF and AMC2-2WCF have a firmware bug which may lead to misinterpretation of access card data that is sent from a Wiegand reader. This may in turn lead to granting physical access to an unauthorized person. This vulnerability affects only products with Wiegand interface, i.e., not devices with OSDP / RS485 interface.

## Affected Products

* Bosch AMS
  + CVE-2023-32228
    - Version(s): <= 5.0
* Bosch BIS
  + CVE-2023-32228
    - Version(s): <= 4.9.2

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the software to a fixed version as soon as possible. Firmware for Bosch AMC2 reader controllers is rolled out automatically by the update mechanism of the access management system, i.e. the Access Management System (AMS) and Building Integration System (BIS) respectively.

* BIS: update BIS installation to version BIS 5.0 (build id BIS\_5.0.21100.0). This version comes with a fixed firmware for the AMC2 reader controllers. The update mechanism of the BIS will automatically roll out the firmware to all attached AMC2 reader controllers.
* AMS: First, update AMS installation to version AMS 5.0.1 (build id AMS\_5.1.7.0). Then apply "Patch for CVE-2023-32228" (filename LCMV3772\_v02.39.01\_Wiegand.zip, TFS #389156). Follow the instructions in the Readme of the patch. The update mechanism of the AMS will automatically roll out the firmware to all attached AMC2 reader controllers.

Please check the Appendix for a list of versions numbers for each affected product.

### Mitigation

Bosch has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.
