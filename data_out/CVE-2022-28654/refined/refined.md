- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Apport did not limit the amount of logging from D-Bus connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input sanitization, specifically regarding the amount of logging from D-Bus connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to fill up the Apport log file, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker with the ability to send D-Bus messages to Apport.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user on the system and must be able to send D-Bus messages to the Apport daemon.
