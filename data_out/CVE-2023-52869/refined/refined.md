Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of a check on the return value of the `kstrdup()` function in the `pstore_register` function within the Linux kernel's pstore/platform.c file. The `kstrdup()` function is used to duplicate a string, and if memory allocation fails, it returns NULL. If the return of `kstrdup()` is not checked and the returned value is NULL, it can cause a NULL pointer dereference later when this value is used, leading to a system crash or other undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a NULL pointer dereference. If `kstrdup()` fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, the code proceeds to use this NULL pointer as if it were a valid memory location to store a string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Crash:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a kernel panic, resulting in a system crash.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system crash can be used as a denial-of-service attack, making the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Memory Pressure:** An attacker may trigger a `kstrdup()` failure by inducing memory pressure on the system.
*   **Registration of crafted backend:** It is possible that an attacker may try to register a crafted persistent store backend that can cause memory allocation issues, although this might be limited to the functionalities provided by the registration function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Register a pstore backend**: An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger the pstore backend registration process, which typically involves having root privileges or the ability to load specific kernel modules, however, there may be ways to register a backend without root.
*   **Memory Manipulation:** While not direct manipulation, the attacker needs to be able to induce memory pressure or somehow influence the `kstrdup` allocation, possibly by carefully crafted parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves checking the return value of `kstrdup()` and returning an error (`-ENOMEM`) if the allocation fails. The fix also includes `kfree(new_backend)` when `psinfo` is already registered to prevent memory leaks.
*   The commits provided in the content all address the same issue, they were applied to different kernel versions. They are different fixes for the same vulnerability.
*   The `Fixes:` tag in the commit messages indicates that the vulnerability was introduced in the commit that switched `pstore_info::name` to const.
*   The vulnerability resides in `fs/pstore/platform.c`.
