Subject: libksieve (used by kmail/kontact) sent password as username

Hello list,

Managesieve is a protocol to configure the email filtering system Sieve via
TCP/IP. It is typically authenticated just like IMAP is. The managesieve
client implementation in KDE (libksieve) had a bug which used the password as
username.

That exposed the password in plaintext server logs, as usernames are commonly
logged on failed login attempts.

This bug has existed for several years and made it into multiple Debian
releases. It has only recently been fixed upstream [1] and even more recently
been fixed in Debian [2] (stable package updates still pending). As this bug
has been documented in the internet at various places [3] [4] but I haven't
seen any mention of it here yet, I thought sharing it here made sense.

As far as I know, no CVE has been allocated for this.

kind regards,
Jonas
