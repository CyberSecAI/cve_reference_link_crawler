The provided content relates to CVE-2024-3420.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `admin/saveedit.php` file of the Online Courseware version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability exists because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, specifically the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Access sensitive data (customer information, personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property)
- Delete or alter data without authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `admin/saveedit.php` file. An attacker can craft malicious SQL queries using the `id` parameter to manipulate the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the web application,  specifically targeting the `admin/saveedit.php` file, and have knowledge about SQL syntax.
