- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection on the Terms of Use page, which allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to accept the terms of use without their knowledge or consent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to socially engineer users into accepting the terms of use of the site by enticing them to visit a malicious page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves social engineering. A remote attacker crafts a malicious webpage that triggers a forged request to the Liferay server when a logged-in user visits it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and entice a logged-in user to visit it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Liferay instance.
