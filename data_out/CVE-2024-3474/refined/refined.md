- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Wow Skype Buttons" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in some bulk actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions, such as deleting buttons, without their consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, triggers the vulnerable action in the plugin. The admin must be tricked into opening this page, which could be delivered via a link in a phishing email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a crafted HTML page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but they need an active, valid administrator session.
