- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to missing `ReportRequestFilter` filter mappings in the `web.xml` configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. The missing filter mappings allow unauthorized access to report, download, output, and extract resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the missing filter mappings.
- **Attack vectors**: By accessing specific URL patterns (`/report/*`, `/download/*`, `/output/*`, `/extract/*`) without proper filtering.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application. No further information is available on whether authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, or if it is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.
