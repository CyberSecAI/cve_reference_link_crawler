Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-26140:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-26140. The Snyk vulnerability report explicitly mentions the CVE ID and describes a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `@excalidraw/excalidraw` package, which aligns with the information expected for this CVE. Additionally, the github pull request and commit provided relate to fixing this vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is **improper input sanitization** of embedded links within whiteboard objects in the `@excalidraw/excalidraw` package. Specifically, the application was not properly sanitizing user-provided URLs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application via crafted URLs. This could be achieved by inserting a malicious `javascript://` link.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Injection:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
- **Data Theft:** This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, including the theft of cookies and user sessions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially gain access to privileged services and functionalities.
- **Malware Delivery:** XSS can be used to deliver malware to unsuspecting users.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could hijack user sessions, impersonating legitimate users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Embedded Links:** The attack vector is through embedded links in whiteboard objects. An attacker could insert a malicious link in an excalidraw document. When a user interacts with the element containing this malicious link, the XSS payload would be executed.
- **Stored XSS:**  The vulnerability is described as a "stored" XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious code is stored within the application (e.g. within an excalidraw drawing file) and is triggered when the stored data is viewed by a user.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to embed a crafted link in an excalidraw drawing. This could be achieved by directly modifying a .excalidraw file or any method where a link can be inserted into a drawing that is loaded by another user.
- The user needs to interact with the malicious link (e.g. by clicking on it). The impact of the vulnerability is triggered by user interaction.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**7. Additional Information (from the provided content, which are more details than the basic CVE description):**

- The fix involved using the `sanitizeUrl` function from the `@braintree/sanitize-url` library.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #6728, which includes several commits related to sanitizing links.
- The vulnerability was present in versions of `@excalidraw/excalidraw` prior to version 0.16.0.
- The pull request also included changes to ensure markdown and [[wiki]] links are still supported after the fix.
- The `normalizeLink` utility function is now exported from the package so that host apps can sanitize links.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Eugene Lim, The MOps Team.
- The fix included modifications to `src/components/App.tsx`, `src/data/restore.ts`, `src/data/url.test.tsx`, `src/data/url.ts`, `src/element/Hyperlink.tsx`, and `src/renderer/renderElement.ts`.

In summary, CVE-2023-26140 is a medium-severity XSS vulnerability caused by improper link sanitization in the `@excalidraw/excalidraw` package. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser session. The fix involves using a URL sanitization library and ensuring all links are sanitized before use.
