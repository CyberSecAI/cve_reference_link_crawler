We should only accept links that start with `https?://` and if it doesn't then add it. Do not allow for relative links.

Test Plan:

On excalidraw.com create a rectangle with a link `javascript://%0aalert(document.domain)` and save it: [javas.excalidraw.zip](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/files/11902099/javas.excalidraw.zip)

In this PR, load the file above and see that the link has `https://` added before:

| [@vjeux](https://github.com/vjeux) we were earlier allowing only `https` but users might want to add different protocols eg `ftp://`, `file://` and may be some custom as mentioned in [#4620 (comment)](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/4620#issuecomment-1015677871) so we should instead whitelist these protocols instead of disallowing all except https, does that make sense ? |

| I did not check the code change in details, but please make sure you continue to allow markdown and [[wiki]] links.  we'll need to add a `props.normalizeLink` so host apps can do what they want, else it's outside the scope of the package to figure out and make decisions for host apps like this.  As for `ftp://` and `file://` protocols, I'm now not sure if it's actually a good idea to allow this as it make be another attack vector. |

| Ok, so instead I've used a sanitizer from Braintree (<https://github.com/braintree/sanitize-url>), which is permissive enough to allow custom formats such as markdown ([@zsviczian](https://github.com/zsviczian) you'll need to sanitize the url yourself once you parse it and render, unless you're using a markdown renderer that does it for you). If needed, we export our link normalize from the package as `normalizeLink`.  This way we don't have to support `props.normalizeLink` which in turn allows us to keep doing the normalization on `restore()`.  That said, `restore()` is not guaranteed to be run in every case, so from security perspective we still want to normalize in runtime when rendering the link or passing it upstream.  Further, we still want to support relative links & retain opening relative links in the same tab. |
