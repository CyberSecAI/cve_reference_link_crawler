The provided content is related to CVE-2024-9796.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `t` parameter before its use in a SQL query within the `wp-advanced-search` plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated SQL injection. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected through the `t` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In the provided proof of concept, user passwords are being extracted.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `autocompletion-PHP5.5.php` file within the plugin. The vulnerable parameter is `t`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
