- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cgiserver.cgi` process incorrectly handles JSON input when parsing commands and parameters. Specifically, the code assumes that the "param" JSON element will always be an object, using the subscription operator to access it. However, if a string or another non-object type is provided for "param," an assertion failure occurs, leading to the process termination and device reboot.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically regarding the type of JSON elements used as command parameters. The code fails to check the type of the "param" element before attempting to access its members as if it were an object.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing the device to reboot. This can disrupt surveillance and other services provided by the camera.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the device's API endpoint (`/cgi-bin/api.cgi`). The request body contains a JSON array where one of the objects within specifies a command and a "param" element that is not an object, causing an assert to be triggered.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. In some cases, the vulnerabilities can be triggered without authentication if the attacker is able to exploit TALOS-2021-1420 to bypass the authentication requirements.
