| ⚠️ Please verify that this feature request has NOT been suggested before.  * I checked and didn't find similar feature request  🏷️ Feature Request Type UI Feature, Other 🔖 Feature description Hi,  Uptime Kuma does not currently support logs & audits for user activity within the portal. This is something that can add some value to the product, especially for the ones who seek security compliance. It would be great to have this.  Alternatively, I am exporting database and application logs while running the application in verbose mode; but it would be nice to have user activities in the portal somehow.  Bests, Ali. ✔️ Solution The easy solution is to dump the logs in a file with user configured buffered size or with specified days of retention (to not get over the size limit) and provide an API to read it from the UI. ❓ Alternatives Support the remote syslog protocol to be configured via dashboard settings. Something like: <https://www.netiq.com/documentation/novelllogmanager11/log_manager_admin/data/bjzkhg5.html> 📝 Additional Context NIST 800-58 SP, SOC2, ISO27001 requires IT systems to have audit logs, and it's pain for companies to use this system and handle those controls. |

| [NIST SP 800-58](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-58.pdf) only targets VOIP => irrelevant  [@CommanderStorm](https://github.com/CommanderStorm), Sorry I meant NIST SP 800-92; it was a late night brain fart. It's not just that one security standard that requires logging in to the system, e.g., if you consider the Microsoft Threat Modeling (STRIDE) as the port of the SSDLC process in a company, not having logs enabled can cause repudiation as a threat.  SOC2+ISO27001 seems to have a form of audit trail requirement from what I can gleam of publicly accessible documents could you provide screenshots of the exact requirements in these documents?  We follow NIST SP 800-53 to implement and build SOC2 controls/policies (as a general guideline), and we dig into more details on other standard releases (e.g., FIPS)  More information: Some of the controls in NIST SP 800-53   * AU-2: Auditable Events * AU-3: Content of Audit Records * AU-6: Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting * AU-12: Audit Generation   and Some of ISO 27001 controls/requirements:   * A.12.4.1: Event Logging: This control requires that event logs recording user activities, exceptions, faults, and information security events should be produced, kept, and regularly reviewed. * A.12.4.2: Protection of Log Information: This control requires that logging facilities and log information should be protected against tampering and unauthorized access. * A.12.4.3: Administrator and Operator Logs: This control requires that system administrator and system operator activities should be logged and the logs protected and regularly reviewed. * A.14.2.5: Secure System Engineering Principles: This control is about using secure engineering principles for developing and maintaining systems. While not specific to logging, it includes principles that could apply to logging.   more: <https://infosavvy.home.blog/2021/04/22/iso-27001-annex-a-12-4-logging-and-monitoring/>  ``` Hottake: Audit-logs are only relevant if more than one user can be present at one time ⇒ uptime-kuma can currently only ever be used by one user which does privileged actions. ⇒ imo only a feature which could become relevant if somebody gets around to implementing https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/128 or one of the duplicates like https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/3272  ```  Naturally IRL, when this happens, we share the password in a shared team key vault or anywhere FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliance and have an update process that we follow (e.g., RACI model) to make sure we minimize the possible risks. We have a process that privileged user follows to increase business continuity...  ``` All actions are currently written to the log => I don't have access to the specs, is this sufficient?  ```  but it's still good to have more meaningful portal-level logs rather than application and database levels.  On the other hand, this Project is open source and open to PRs. Here is our contribution guide: [https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md%60)  Yeah, I thought of that as well, but not sure if I am a good JS/TS developer; I will try my best 👍 |

# Persistentent User Sessions

## Package

louislam/uptime-kuma
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Description

# Summary

Attackers with access to a users' device can gain persistent account access.

This is caused by missing verification of Session Tokens after password changes and/or elapsed inactivity-periods.

# Details

`uptime-kuma` sets JWT tokens for users after successful authentication.

These tokens have the following design flaws:

* After successful login, a JWT token and it is stored in `sessionStorage` or `localStorage`.

  Which of the two is decided based on the `Remember Me` button.

  The users' token is valid without any time limitation, even after long periods of inactivity.

  This increases the risk of session hijacking if, for example, a user forgets to log off and leaves the PC.
* sessions are only deleted on the client side after a user loggs out, meaning a local attacker could reuse said token with deep system access over the browser
* If a user changes a password
  + any previously logged in clients are not logged out
  + previously issued tokens remained valid forever

These flaws allow user cookies to remain valid even after changing passwords or being inactive, posing a high security risk.

# POC

### Password resets not deactivating cookies

* Log in.
* Note the user cookie.
* Change your password.
* Attempt to log in again with the same cookie.
* The cookie remains valid despite the password change.

### Inactivity not deactivating sessions

In testing, even after a period of over a day of inactivity, the session was still valid

# Impact

Another person with local access to the device could take over the session permanently, even after hours of previous inactivity or a password change.

Such activity would not be obvious to the user (see [#3481](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/issues/3481) if you want to help with this).

With this gained account access, an attacker can cause:

## confidentially loss

* monitors (including private ones not shared on public status pages)
* notification providers
* settings like `api-keys` (only used for accessing `/metrics`)
* settings like secrets like the `Steam API Key`
* maintenance periods

## availability loss

* by creating a lot of monitors and setting the retention policy very high leading to degraded database performance or out of storage
* by creating a lot of `HTTP(s) - Browser Engine (Chrome/Chromium) (Beta)` leading to RAM exhaustion

## integrity loss

* by the attacker deleting a monitor
* by the attacker deleting a monitor's history
* by the atacker changing the meaning of a monitor (changing where it points)

## scope creep

If operated in some restricted network, access to monitors may provide the ability to change the scope of the attack to a different piece of infrastructure, for example via SQL commands to a database server.

We have not classified this as `changed scope` because credentials stored in the application for accessing other systems are existing valid paths across the trust boundary, and the user should be aware of that.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
