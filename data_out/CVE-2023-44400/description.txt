Uptime Kuma is a self-hosted monitoring tool. Prior to version 1.23.3, attackers with access to a user's device can gain persistent account access. This is caused by missing verification of Session Tokens after password changes and/or elapsed inactivity periods. Version 1.23.3 has a patch for the issue.
