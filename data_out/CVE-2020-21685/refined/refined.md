- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `hash_findi` function due to an out-of-bounds read operation in `hashtbl.c:157` during macro expansion. Specifically, `strlen` reads beyond the allocated buffer while handling a crafted input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow in `hash_findi` function
- **Impact of exploitation**: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash, as evidenced by the ASAN log and the program aborting. This could potentially be leveraged for more severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, though the provided information doesn't confirm this.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted assembly file with a specific macro definition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted assembly file to NASM. This suggests that exploitation can occur on a system where a user processes attacker-controlled assembly code. The attacker must be able to get NASM to process the malicious assembly file to trigger the vulnerability.
