Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of a SQL parameter within the `aitable` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `attributes` variable, submitted via POST or GET, is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user-supplied input (`attributes` variable) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Technical and personal data leaks:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, product information, and other confidential details.
*   **Obtain admin access:** By injecting specific SQL queries, an attacker might be able to create a new administrative account or modify an existing one, gaining full control over the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop:** An attacker could execute SQL commands to delete or truncate database tables, causing significant data loss and disruption.
*   **Display sensitives tables to front-office**: The attacker could potentially display sensitive tables to the front-office. This could be used to unlock potential admin's AJAX scripts of modules that are protected by tokens.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **HTTP GET/POST parameters:** The `attributes` variable is submitted via HTTP GET or POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of PrestaShop and SQL:** The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerable code.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `includes/ajax.php` file of the `aitable` module.
*   The affected versions are up to and including 0.2.1. Version 0.2.2 includes a patch that fixes this issue.
*   The patch involves using `implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', $attributes)))` to sanitize the `attributes` parameter, instead of directly using `pSql($attributes)`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP call.
* The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
