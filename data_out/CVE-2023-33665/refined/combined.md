[Friends-Of-Presta Security Advisories](/)

[Cybersecurity Glossary](/glossary/)[About](/about/)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE, like the one provided below.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org** or visit [https://security-presta.org](https://security-presta.org/) for more information.

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.

# [CVE-2023-33665] Improper neutralization of a SQL parameter in aitable from ai-dev module for PrestaShop

Aug 1, 2023

In the module “Attributes table” (aitable) for PrestaShop, an attacker can perform a SQL injection up to 0.2.1. Release 0.2.2 fixed this security issue.

## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-33665](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-33665)
* **Published at**: 2023-08-01
* **Advisory source**: Friends-Of-Presta.org
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: aitable
* **Impacted release**: <= 0.2.1 (0.2.2 fixed issue)
* **Product author**: ai-dev
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Up to 0.2.2, a sensitive SQL call in file `includes/ajax.php` can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a blind SQL injection throught the POST or GET submitted `attributes` variables.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Technical and personal data leaks
* Obtain admin access
* Remove all data of the linked PrestaShop
* Display sensitives tables to front-office to unlock potential admin’s ajax scripts of modules protected by token on the ecosystem

## Patch

```
--- a/modules/aitable/includes/ajax.php
+++ b/modules/aitable/includes/ajax.php
        $data = array();
        foreach ($lines as $line) {
            foreach ($columns as $col) {
                $result = Db::getInstance()->getRow(
                    'SELECT COUNT(pac.id_product_attribute) AS count, pa.* FROM '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute AS pa LEFT JOIN '._DB_PREFIX_.'product_attribute_combination AS pac ON pac.id_product_attribute = pa.id_product_attribute WHERE '.
-                    'pac.id_attribute IN ('.pSql($attributes).','.(int)$line['id_attribute'].','.(int)$col['id_attribute'].') AND pa.id_product = '.(int)$product_id.' GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING count = '.(int)$count
+                    'pac.id_attribute IN ('.implode(',', array_map('intval', explode(',', $attributes))).','.(int)$line['id_attribute'].','.(int)$col['id_attribute'].') AND pa.id_product = '.(int)$product_id.' GROUP BY pa.id_product_attribute HAVING count = '.(int)$count
                );

```
## Other recommandations

* + To help improve the security of your PrestaShop installation, we recommend upgrading to the latest version. One of the benefits of upgrading is that it will disable the use of multiquery executions (separated by semicolons). However, please be aware that this **will not protect** your shop against SQL injection attacks that use the UNION clause to steal data. Additionally, it’s important to note that PrestaShop includes a function called pSQL, which includes a strip\_tags function. This helps protect your shop against [Stored XSS (also known as XSS T2) of Category 1](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/modules/2023/02/07/stored-xss.html). If a pSQL function is missing, it could potentially expose your project to critical Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to edge cases. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that all relevant functions are properly implemented and used consistently throughout your project.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` by a new longer arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942’s rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against these set of rules.

### More info

To familiarize yourself with what is done on the web, you have **visited** several sites in the **same field** as yours, and you have **realized** that all had a c**ommon point**, and not a good point, the **visual bland** and **standardized** that everyone uses, either for **lack of means** or **lack of creativity**, and suddenly you say that customers always see the same thing, and that their choice is therefore only on the prices.

So you are **tired** of the simple but **not very exciting** display of Prestashop, this technique will allow you on one hand to revive the **interest of visitors** to your site compared to competitors, which can cause a purchase even if your rates are a little above those practiced in the area, but you can also look to put important information **more visible** and especially to distinguish yourself from the competition by adding a **more ergonomic** and **fun display** for you customers.

**Simplify the display of some attributes** and make understanding of these **simplest to your customers** is exactly what provides the **attribute display in a table module**.

At a glance, the **prices of both attributes are visible** to the customer and his **choice is simplified**, no need to go through the different attribute values to get a purchase price.

This module allows to define two attributes that will be displayed as a table.

The first attribute (the one displayed in columns) can be a delay attribute for **delivery for** **example** in this case you can determine the days to be taken into account for the calculation of delivery time, public holidays are automatically taken into account.

**The module is fully skinnable.**

Links to download the documentations of the module are available at the bottom of the page.
