The upload of QR code images for eSIM proﬁles has been ﬁxed.
Network ﬁxes
Switching link prioritization was deﬁcient since 4.4.0.104. This is ﬁxed
DHCP improvements
DHCP can now be conﬁgured for BR interfaces.
WWAN connections
The network registration process of modems from the Ublox TOBY-L2 series has been improved.
LLDP
The LLDP daemon (lldpd) was only started on every second attempt when changing protocols for a
currently active lldpd. This issue has been ﬁxed.
Improved handling of virtual wlan interfaces
Virtual interfaces can now be enabled and disabled, keeping their conﬁguration.
GUI
While changing the LAN IP address range the DHCP server range notiﬁcation pop-up was missing.
Conﬁguration upload
The upload of larger conﬁgurations could result in the router running in a timeout and as a conse-
quence ending up in an error state. This issue has been ﬁxed.
Modem ﬁxes
TOBY-L2 modems were not reset properly, this issue has been ﬁxed.
ITxPT
The ITxPT MQTT service was not announced in mDNS, because of a missing symlink.
Web interface
When conﬁguring a new IP address for the interface that is currently used for reaching the web inter-
face, the browser will be redirected to the newly conﬁgured address.
Serial Console
A misconﬁguration of the serial console caused output on the serial port when it was disabled, this
has been ﬁxed.
IPsec improvements
Shared networks were not routed correctly when trying to access them directly from the tunnel end-
point and thus were not reachable. This issue has been ﬁxed.
In IPsec tunnel conﬁgurations using "0.0.0.0" or an empty ﬁeld for a local ID or peer ID of type "IP
Address", the tunnel was not established. This issue has been ﬁxed.
WLAN Roaming
When roaming as a client between multiple access points, sometimes the link was taken down during
the change from one access point to another. This issue has been ﬁxed.
L2TPv3
In previous versions, a bug in the L2TPv3 implementation prevented tunnels with udp encapsulation
to become up. This issue has been ﬁxed.

Fixed a redirect issue when upgrading to a secure connection. There was no direct security implica-
tion.
