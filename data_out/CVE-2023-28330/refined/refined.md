Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within the backup functionality of Moodle. Specifically, when creating and restoring backups, Moodle does not properly validate the content of backup files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Arbitrary File Read: Maliciously crafted backup files can be used to trigger the reading of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Breach: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing usernames, passwords, configuration files, and other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Backup File: The attacker creates a backup file designed to exploit the vulnerability and uploads it to the Moodle platform.
- Restore Functionality:  The attacker leverages the restore functionality of Moodle to process their malicious backup, triggering the arbitrary file read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have a valid account on the Moodle platform with the ability to access the backup/restore features.
- Specific roles with required permissions:  The capability to access the backup and restore feature is typically available to teachers, managers and admins by default.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 4.1 to 4.1.1, 4.0 to 4.0.6, 3.11 to 3.11.12, 3.9 to 3.9.19 and earlier unsupported versions.
- **Fixed Versions:** Moodle versions 4.1.2, 4.0.7, 3.11.13 and 3.9.20.
- **Workaround:** The provided workaround suggests temporarily removing the restore activity/course capabilities until the security patch is applied.
