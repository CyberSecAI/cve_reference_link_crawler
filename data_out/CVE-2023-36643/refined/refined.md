Based on the provided information, this GitHub repository contains details regarding CVE-2023-36643.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect access control in the `oordershow` action within the `customer` function of ITB-GmbH TradePro v9.5.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to view order information. Specifically, the application does not verify if the user requesting order information is authorized to access it.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure of all orders from the online shop. An attacker can retrieve sensitive order information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP(S) request to a specific endpoint with arbitrary order numbers. The endpoint is `/shop/de/sys/?func=customer&action=oordershow&wkid=[COOKIE]&bestellid=[BESTELL_ID]`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know a valid but unauthenticated session cookie `wkid`, and the attacker needs to guess or enumerate order numbers `bestellid`. The report indicates that the order ID `bestellid` could be enumerated or obtained via SQLi (see CVE-2023-36645)
