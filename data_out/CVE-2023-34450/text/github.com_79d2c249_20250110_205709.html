This is actually more than that, as the error is reproduced in test units. It looks more like an infinite loop when marshalling to JSON. |

| This is actually more than that, as the error is reproduced in test units. It looks more like an infinite loop when marshalling to JSON.  Since cmtjson.Marshal inside MarshalJSON of PeerState trigger itself again which implements JSONMarshaler interface, it causes recursive call. |
