Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34450:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2023-34450. This CVE is associated with a deadlock issue in the `cometbft` library, specifically related to the `PeerState` JSON serialization.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a recursive call within the `MarshalJSON` method of the `PeerState` struct. When debug logging is enabled (or the `dump_consensus_state` RPC endpoint is used) and the log output is set to JSON, the `MarshalJSON` method can end up calling itself, leading to a deadlock because of internal mutexes and reflection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Recursive `MarshalJSON`:** The `MarshalJSON` implementation, due to how the `cmtjson` library is used, triggers a recursive call via reflection when attempting to serialize an object with the same type, leading to an infinite loop.
    *   **Data Race:**  The original implementation without `MarshalJSON` had data races due to unsynchronized reads of the `PeerState` during logging, and concurrent writes using locks in `SetHasProposal` and `SetHasVote` methods (which was fixed by adding a lock in the `MarshalJSON`). However, the addition of `MarshalJSON` led to the infinite loop described above.
    *   **Unprotected Mutex Copy:** A previous attempt to fix the problem involved creating a copy of the `PeerState` struct, but doing so copies the internal `sync.Mutex`, which is explicitly not supported by the standard library.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Case 1 (Debug logs):** A deadlock will occur within most goroutines, effectively halting the node. This is triggered by a `Debug`-level log when logging is configured to `json` and the consensus component is at debug level. This scenario is unlikely in production.
    *   **Case 2 (RPC `dump_consensus_state`):** The deadlock affects only the data structures for the *first* peer accessed in a `for` loop within RPC endpoint, plus the goroutine(s) dealing with the RPC request(s). With more peers, the impact is limited to only a single peer; with 2 peers (each having one `PeerState`), both nodes get deadlocked until the peer connection times out, and then the issue can be retriggered.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Logging Configuration:** Setting the consensus logging module to `debug` and the log output format to `json`.
    *   **RPC Endpoint:** Calling the `dump_consensus_state` RPC endpoint.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Case 1:** Requires the ability to set the log level to `debug` (or use the `json` output)
    *   **Case 2:** Requires the ability to call the RPC `dump_consensus_state` endpoint.
    * No specific user privileges are needed, and both attack vectors are network-based.

**3. Additional Technical Details**

*   The issue was introduced by a change that renamed `(*PeerState).ToJSON` to `MarshalJSON` in an attempt to fix data races, which in turn introduced a recursive call.
*   The fix involved creating a type alias of the `PeerState` struct (e.g. `type aPeerState PeerState`) and casting a pointer of the original struct to the type alias before marshalling using the `cmtjson` lib, preventing the recursive call and avoiding copying mutexes by using a pointer.
*   The vulnerability was present in `cometbft` versions `v0.34.28` and `v0.37.1` and was fixed in `v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2` .
*   The fix for this CVE involved changes to `consensus/reactor.go`, which contains the `PeerState` struct definition and related logic.

**4. Affected Code**

The core of the vulnerability lies in the `MarshalJSON` method of the `PeerState` struct and how it interacts with the `cmtjson` marshalling library, specifically in the files:
* `consensus/reactor.go`

**5. Mitigation**

The content from the security advisory lists workarounds:

*   For the logging-based issue, use `plain` logging output or set the consensus module log level to `info` or higher.
*   For the RPC-based issue, do not expose the `dump_consensus_state` RPC endpoint publicly.

The content from the github PRs list the correct fix by applying the appropriate version and the fix is available as of v0.34.29 and v0.37.2.

**6. Severity**

The severity is considered Low due to the limited impact of the RPC-based exploitation and the fact that the logging-based exploitation should be unlikely in production and the fact that the described exploit is very specific in terms of the steps to reproduce it.

**In Summary**

CVE-2023-34450 is a low-severity vulnerability in `cometbft` caused by a recursive call during JSON serialization of the `PeerState` struct. It can lead to deadlocks in logging operations or through the RPC `dump_consensus_state` endpoint. Patched versions (`v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2`) are available, and workarounds are possible to mitigate the impact in unpatched systems.
