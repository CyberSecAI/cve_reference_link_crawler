- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page, which will then be executed by a victim's browser when they visit the page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to an account takeover or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a page containing the injected malicious JavaScript payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the web page, which can be achieved through a variety of attack methods depending on the vulnerable system. A user needs to visit the page with the injected script to be affected. The attacker needs a low level of privileges to perform the attack, but a user must also interact with the system.
