Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-6528

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.4 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site
Scripting') vulnerability exists that could cause a vulnerability leading to a cross-site scripting
condition where attackers can have a victim’s browser run arbitrary JavaScript when they visit a
page containing the injected payload.

Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the
CVSS Base metrics in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and
Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such

Mitigations

Affected Product & Version

Mitigations

Modicon Controllers M241 /
M251, M258, M262, and
Modicon Motion Controller
LMC058

All versions

 Customers should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Use controllers and devices only in a protected
environment to minimize network exposure and
ensure that they are not accessible from public
internet or untrusted networks.

•  Ensure usage of user management and password
features. User rights are enabled by default and
forced to create a strong password at first use.

•  Deactivate the Webserver after use when not

needed.

•  Use encrypted communication links.
•  Setup network segmentation and implement a

firewall to block all unauthorized access to ports
80/HTTP and 443/HTTPS.

•  Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if

remote access is required.

•  The “Cybersecurity Guidelines for EcoStruxure

Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers
and Associated Equipment” provide product specific
hardening guidelines.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for

that device.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
