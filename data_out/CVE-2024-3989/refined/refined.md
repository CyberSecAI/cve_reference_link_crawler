Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the "HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor" plugin's Gallery Justify Widget.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided data when rendering the Gallery Justify widget, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page using the vulnerable widget. When a user visits the page, the injected script will execute in the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Other client side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the Gallery Justify widget.
*   An authenticated user, with contributor-level access or higher, can inject malicious scripts when using the Gallery Justify widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level privileges.
*   **Plugin Usage:** The attacker must be able to use the Elementor page builder and the vulnerable Gallery Justify widget.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 2.5.0 of the "HT Mega – Absolute Addons For Elementor" plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.5.1.
*   The fix included using `absint()` to sanitize integer values for the `row_height` and `space_margin` settings and `htmlspecialchars()` when outputting the `popover_text` and `tooltip_text`.
