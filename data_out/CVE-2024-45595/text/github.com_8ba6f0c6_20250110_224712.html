# Remote Code Execution through the Query input on Chart Builder

Moderate

Sep 10, 2024

## Package

pip

dtale
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.14.1

## Patched versions

3.14.1

## Description

### Impact

Users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 3.14.1 where the "Custom Filter" input is turned off by default. You can find out more information on how to turn it back on [here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)

### Workarounds

The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.14.1 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.

### References

See "Custom Filter" [documentation](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-45595

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)
