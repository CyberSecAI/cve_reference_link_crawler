The provided content relates to CVE-2024-1307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Smart Forms plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with minimal privileges (like a subscriber) to access and execute actions meant for higher-level users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Broken access control, specifically missing authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with subscriber-level access can edit form entries and modify submitted data.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a subscriber-level account on the WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. They can then use a web browser's console to make the malicious request.
