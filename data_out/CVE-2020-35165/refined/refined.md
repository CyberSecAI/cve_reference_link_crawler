{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Observable Timing Discrepancy",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software contains an observable timing discrepancy that could be exploited by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure, as indicated by the 'C:H' (Confidentiality: High) in the CVSS vector.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access (AV:L) is required for this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the affected system and the exploitation requires high complexity (AC:H), and no privileges (PR:N), and no user interaction(UI:N). Scope is Unchanged (S:U)."
