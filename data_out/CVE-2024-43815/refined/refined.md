Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `mxs-dcp` driver when using hardware key slots for AES encryption. The payload field, which is meant to carry key data, wasn't being properly zeroed out when a key slot was used. This could potentially lead to the leakage of stack memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** Stack memory could be leaked through the payload field of the DMA descriptor when using hardware key slots with the AES engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data residing on the kernel stack could be exposed through the leaked memory. This information could potentially be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by performing AES encryption using a key from a hardware key slot and not providing the key from main memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger AES encryption operations using the `mxs-dcp` driver and have the ability to choose to use a hardware key slot for encryption.
