### preview.twilio.com/sync API Endpoint Will End of Life on March 10, 2025

We’re making some updates to an API endpoint to ensure Twilio’s core services remain reliable and robust.

**What’s Changing?**

Starting March 10, 2025, the preview.twilio.com/sync API endpoint will reach its end of life (EOL). After this date, any requests sent to this endpoint will result in a 400 error.

Customers need to update their applications to use the sync.twilio.com endpoint to keep their services running smoothly and access the latest Sync features.

**What Action is Required?**

To prevent service disruptions, customers should update their code to use the sync.twilio.com endpoint before the deprecation date. This change requires updating the DNS reference in your application configuration. Here’s how to make the change:

1. Locate the references: Identify where your application uses the preview.twilio.com/sync endpoint.
2. Update the URL: Replace it with the sync.twilio.com endpoint.
3. Test your application: Confirm the changes to ensure your application functions as expected.

**Need Help?**

Check out our [Sync API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sync) for detailed guidance, or reach out to the Twilio Support team if you need assistance.

### Agent Copilot enhances wrap-up with topics and subtopics

Agent Copilot (public beta) now has the ability to automatically identify the reasons behind customer inquiries with topics and subtopics as part of its automated wrap-up feature.

Create topics and subtopics if you need more granularity via your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/flex/ai-features/copilot/wrapup-notes). Copilot automatically selects the most relevant topic and subtopic based on the customer's conversation. This feature is another step towards leveraging AI to improve agent handle time during wrap-up and enables deeper analysis of contact center interactions.

Upgrade to Flex UI 2.10 and view our [docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/admin-guide/setup/copilot/setup) to get started.

### Launching the Compliance Embeddable for Toll-Free Verification in Public Beta

The Compliance Embeddable is a white-label React component designed to seamlessly integrate into an ISV's web application as an iframe. This product enables ISVs to securely collect compliance information from their customers and send it directly to Twilio, streamlining compliance and shortening customer’s time-to-market. For ISVs, the Compliance Embeddable serves as a great alternative to manually collecting information from customers, and requires less development work compared to integrating with the Twilio Toll-Free Verification APIs and building their own UI.

The Compliance Embeddable is offered for free and is now available in Public Beta. Please follow the instructions in [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/toll-free/compliance-embeddable-onboarding) to get started.

### [U.S. A2P 10DLC] Launching Support for CNP Migration

Twilio is excited to announce support for TCR’s Campaign Connectivity Partner (CNP) Migration Tool. This enhancement allows Campaign Service Providers (CSPs) to seamlessly migrate directly registered TCR campaigns to Twilio from other messaging API providers without the need for re-registration.

Key Benefits:

* **Reduced Disruptions**: Campaigns remain active during the migration process, ensuring uninterrupted messaging.
* **Simplified Transfers**: A secondary CNP chain is created and transitions automatically to the primary chain once all approvals are finalized.
* **Cost-Effective**: Migration incurs only an $8 fee per campaign.

For more information, visit our [Help Article on Direct TCR Registration](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260803965730-Can-I-go-directly-to-The-Campaign-Registry-for-US-A2P-10DLC-registration "Help Article") for Externally Registered Campaigns, and review our [API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/a2p-10dlc/externally-registered-campaigns-api "API Doc") for the registration process.

### ConversationRelay is now available in Public Beta

<Connect><ConversationRelay> is a new TwiML noun and Service Provider Interface (SPI) for building genAI-powered virtual agents. ConversationRelay makes voice AI integrations straightforward, so you can focus on delivering the self-service experiences customers expect without diving into the complexities of voice technology. It combines low-latency speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with human-like conversational pacing, orchestration, and seamless interruption handling through a websocket API. Bring your own large language model (LLM) and let Twilio take care of the rest.

RCS now offers the option to create visually engaging messages with images, video and audio content globally.

Devices that cannot receive media via RCS will still receive MMS messages where supported or a link to the media. If you want to learn more about RCS and request access, you can do so [here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/rcs).

### Increased Digital Verification for UK Regulatory Compliance Bundles

UPDATE: This change is anticipated to be made on January 6th, 2025

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To improve the experience for purchasing long codes in the United Kingdom, we have added more digital verification capabilities to vet business registration information.

Improved digital verification capabilities allow the following improvements to the Regulatory Compliance Policies for the United Kingdom:

- Documents are no longer required for Businesses that are not registered in the UK Companies House. Previously, documents were required when users selected “Other” or non-UK registration authorities such as EIN for US based companies.

- Emergency Address is no longer required during RC Bundle creation. However, users placing outbound calls must still add their emergency address SID to their Phone Number(s) as part of Phone Number configuration.

While the [Regulation Resource API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) response will reflect these changes in requirements, for API integrations leveraging the [v2 Regulatory Compliance API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api), documents and Emergency Addresses will still be accepted and can be used to assist verification.

### Twilio Voice Android and iOS SDKs Preflight APIs are available now in GA

The Twilio Programmable Voice iOS and Android SDKs (mobile) now each have a suite of “Preflight” APIs. Previously supported only on the [Voice JS SDK](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/javascript/twiliopreflighttest), these new mobile diagnostics tools provide pre-call assessments of network stability, bandwidth, latency, jitter, MOS scores, and packet loss. This enables customers to enhance user experience by showing network warnings, prioritizing mobile data, or preventing calls on unreliable networks, ensuring more successful connections.

Check out [the docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/mobile-preflight-test) for more information on how to use the new functionality in your application. We can’t wait to see what you build!
