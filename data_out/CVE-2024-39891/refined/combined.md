### preview.twilio.com/sync API Endpoint Will End of Life on March 10, 2025

We’re making some updates to an API endpoint to ensure Twilio’s core services remain reliable and robust.

**What’s Changing?**

Starting March 10, 2025, the preview.twilio.com/sync API endpoint will reach its end of life (EOL). After this date, any requests sent to this endpoint will result in a 400 error.

Customers need to update their applications to use the sync.twilio.com endpoint to keep their services running smoothly and access the latest Sync features.

**What Action is Required?**

To prevent service disruptions, customers should update their code to use the sync.twilio.com endpoint before the deprecation date. This change requires updating the DNS reference in your application configuration. Here’s how to make the change:

1. Locate the references: Identify where your application uses the preview.twilio.com/sync endpoint.
2. Update the URL: Replace it with the sync.twilio.com endpoint.
3. Test your application: Confirm the changes to ensure your application functions as expected.

**Need Help?**

Check out our [Sync API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sync) for detailed guidance, or reach out to the Twilio Support team if you need assistance.

### Agent Copilot enhances wrap-up with topics and subtopics

Agent Copilot (public beta) now has the ability to automatically identify the reasons behind customer inquiries with topics and subtopics as part of its automated wrap-up feature.

Create topics and subtopics if you need more granularity via your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/flex/ai-features/copilot/wrapup-notes). Copilot automatically selects the most relevant topic and subtopic based on the customer's conversation. This feature is another step towards leveraging AI to improve agent handle time during wrap-up and enables deeper analysis of contact center interactions.

Upgrade to Flex UI 2.10 and view our [docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/admin-guide/setup/copilot/setup) to get started.

### Launching the Compliance Embeddable for Toll-Free Verification in Public Beta

The Compliance Embeddable is a white-label React component designed to seamlessly integrate into an ISV's web application as an iframe. This product enables ISVs to securely collect compliance information from their customers and send it directly to Twilio, streamlining compliance and shortening customer’s time-to-market. For ISVs, the Compliance Embeddable serves as a great alternative to manually collecting information from customers, and requires less development work compared to integrating with the Twilio Toll-Free Verification APIs and building their own UI.

The Compliance Embeddable is offered for free and is now available in Public Beta. Please follow the instructions in [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/toll-free/compliance-embeddable-onboarding) to get started.

### [U.S. A2P 10DLC] Launching Support for CNP Migration

Twilio is excited to announce support for TCR’s Campaign Connectivity Partner (CNP) Migration Tool. This enhancement allows Campaign Service Providers (CSPs) to seamlessly migrate directly registered TCR campaigns to Twilio from other messaging API providers without the need for re-registration.

Key Benefits:

* **Reduced Disruptions**: Campaigns remain active during the migration process, ensuring uninterrupted messaging.
* **Simplified Transfers**: A secondary CNP chain is created and transitions automatically to the primary chain once all approvals are finalized.
* **Cost-Effective**: Migration incurs only an $8 fee per campaign.

For more information, visit our [Help Article on Direct TCR Registration](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260803965730-Can-I-go-directly-to-The-Campaign-Registry-for-US-A2P-10DLC-registration "Help Article") for Externally Registered Campaigns, and review our [API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/compliance/a2p-10dlc/externally-registered-campaigns-api "API Doc") for the registration process.

### ConversationRelay is now available in Public Beta

<Connect><ConversationRelay> is a new TwiML noun and Service Provider Interface (SPI) for building genAI-powered virtual agents. ConversationRelay makes voice AI integrations straightforward, so you can focus on delivering the self-service experiences customers expect without diving into the complexities of voice technology. It combines low-latency speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities with human-like conversational pacing, orchestration, and seamless interruption handling through a websocket API. Bring your own large language model (LLM) and let Twilio take care of the rest.

Check out the [blog post](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/conversationrelay-voice-ai-made-human) to learn more. If you’re ready to dive right into code you can find [the docs here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/connect/conversationrelay). We can’t wait to see what you build!

### Introducing media for RCS on Twilio Messaging public beta

RCS now offers the option to create visually engaging messages with images, video and audio content globally. When you send media messages through Messaging Services, Twilio will automatically deliver RCS media messages to compatible devices. Devices that cannot receive media via RCS will still receive MMS messages where supported or a link to the media. If you want to learn more about RCS and request access, you can do so [here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/rcs).

### Increased Digital Verification for UK Regulatory Compliance Bundles

UPDATE: This change is anticipated to be made on January 6th, 2025

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To improve the experience for purchasing long codes in the United Kingdom, we have added more digital verification capabilities to vet business registration information.

Improved digital verification capabilities allow the following improvements to the Regulatory Compliance Policies for the United Kingdom:

- Documents are no longer required for Businesses that are not registered in the UK Companies House. Previously, documents were required when users selected “Other” or non-UK registration authorities such as EIN for US based companies.

- Emergency Address is no longer required during RC Bundle creation. However, users placing outbound calls must still add their emergency address SID to their Phone Number(s) as part of Phone Number configuration.

While the [Regulation Resource API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api/regulations) response will reflect these changes in requirements, for API integrations leveraging the [v2 Regulatory Compliance API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/api), documents and Emergency Addresses will still be accepted and can be used to assist verification.

### Twilio Voice Android and iOS SDKs Preflight APIs are available now in GA

The Twilio Programmable Voice iOS and Android SDKs (mobile) now each have a suite of “Preflight” APIs. Previously supported only on the [Voice JS SDK](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/javascript/twiliopreflighttest), these new mobile diagnostics tools provide pre-call assessments of network stability, bandwidth, latency, jitter, MOS scores, and packet loss. This enables customers to enhance user experience by showing network warnings, prioritizing mobile data, or preventing calls on unreliable networks, ensuring more successful connections.

Check out [the docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sdks/mobile-preflight-test) for more information on how to use the new functionality in your application. We can’t wait to see what you build!

# Hackers abused API to verify millions of Authy MFA phone numbers

Twilio has confirmed that an unsecured API endpoint allowed threat actors to verify the phone numbers of millions of Authy multi-factor authentication users, potentially making them vulnerable to SMS phishing and SIM swapping attacks.

Authy is a mobile app that generates multi-factor authentication codes at websites where you have MFA enabled.

In late June, a threat actor named ShinyHunters leaked a CSV text file containing what they claim are 33 million phone numbers registered with the Authy service.

*Source: BleepingComputer*

The CSV file contains 33,420,546 rows, each containing an account ID, phone number, an "over\_the\_top" column, account status, and device count.

Twilio has now confirmed to BleepingComputer that the threat actors compiled the list of phone numbers using an unauthenticated API endpoint.

"Twilio has detected that threat actors were able to identify data associated with Authy accounts, including phone numbers, due to an unauthenticated endpoint. We have taken action to secure this endpoint and no longer allow unauthenticated requests," Twilio told BleepingComputer.

"We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data. As a precaution, we are requesting all Authy users to update to the latest Android and iOS apps for the latest security updates and encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around phishing and smishing attacks."

In 2022, Twilio disclosed it suffered breaches in [June](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-discloses-another-hack-from-june-blames-voice-phishing/) and [August](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-breach-let-hackers-gain-access-to-authy-2fa-accounts/) that allowed threat actors to breach its infrastructure and access Authy customer information.

## Abusing unsecured APIs

BleepingComputer has learned that the data was compiled by feeding a massive list of phone numbers into the unsecured API endpoint. If the number was valid, the endpoint would return information about the associated accounts registered with Authy.

Now that the API has been secured, it can no longer be abused to verify whether a phone number is used with Authy.

This technique is similar to how threat actors [abused an unsecured Twitter API](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twitter-confirms-zero-day-used-to-expose-data-of-54-million-accounts/) and [Facebook API](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-leaked-on-hacker-forum/) to compile profiles of tens of millions of users that contain both public and non-public information.

While the Authy scrape only contained phone numbers, they can still be advantageous to users looking to conduct smishing and SIM swapping attacks to breach accounts.

ShinyHunters alludes to this in their post, stating, "You guys can join it on gemini or Nexo db," suggesting that threat actors compare the list of phone numbers to those leaked in alleged Gemini and Nexo data breaches.

If matches are found, the threat actors could attempt to perform SIM swapping attacks or phishing attacks to breach the cryptocurrency exchange accounts and steal all the assets.

Twilio has now [released a new security update](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/Security_Alert_Authy_App_Android_iOS) and recommends that users upgrade to Authy Android (v25.1.0) and iOS App (v26.1.0), which includes security updates. It is unclear how this security update helps to protect users from threat actors using the scraped data in attacks.

Authy users should also ensure their mobile accounts are configured to block number transfers without providing a passcode or turning off security protections.

Furthermore, Authy users should be on the lookout for potential SMS phishing attacks that attempt to steal more sensitive data, such as passwords.

In what appears to be an unrelated breach, Twilio has also begun [sending data breach notifications](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40864060) after a third-party vendor's unsecured AWS S3 bucket exposed SMS-related data sent through the company.

  "I don't think Authy is FOSS."

  Exactly, Authy is the anti-FOSS: closed source with no export methods, and all their other twilio branches force you to use Authy as their 2-FA, such as SendGrid.

  This is funny because I tried to open a Twilio account a few months ago, and they replied by email demanding to know what my application is. I truthfully told them it was for personal use and they acted like they did not believe me. (I was building & testing a custom PBX system). I told them I am not going to beg -- if my money is not good enough for them I will happily spend it elsewhere. They basically told me to go ahead and do that, so I did. At the time I had no knowledge of these security lapses and now I am really glad they rejected my business.
