Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the `sort` parameter in the Continew Admin v3.2.0 application. This parameter is used to control the `ORDER BY` clause in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize the user-supplied `sort` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Incomplete Keyword Filtering:** The `setColumn()` method, which is responsible for sanitizing input, uses a regular expression to remove certain characters. However, this filtering is insufficient, allowing SQL injection payloads to bypass the checks. Specifically, the filtering regex `"'|\"|\\<|\\>|&|\\*|\\+|=|#|-|;|\\s*|\t|\r|\n"` does not prevent the injection of SQL keywords and functions, like `sleep`, `substr`, `SELECT`, `ASCII`, etc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database.
*   **Potential for further attacks**: This could be leveraged to modify or delete data, or gain further access to the system. The provided example uses the `sleep` function for demonstration, but other malicious SQL code could be injected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `/api/system/user` endpoint with a malicious `sort` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Continew Admin application to exploit the vulnerability. They must be logged in to access the affected endpoints, specifically the user management functionality under System Administration.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Continew Admin server.
*   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the API requests and the purpose of the `sort` parameter.
