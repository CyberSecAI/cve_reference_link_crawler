## Welcome to the World of OPC

In today’s complex economy, information is the key to business success and profitability. OPC technologies were created to allow information to be easily and securely exchanged between diverse platforms from multiple vendors and to allow seamless integration of those platforms without costly, time-consuming software development. This frees engineering resources to do the more important work of running your business. Today, there are more than 5,200 suppliers who have created more than 42,000 different OPC products used in more than 52 million applications. The estimate of the savings in engineering resources alone is in the billions of dollars.
