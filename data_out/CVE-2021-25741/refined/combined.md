| A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user may be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files & directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.  This issue has been rated **High** ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)), and assigned **[CVE-2021-25741](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5f7-6478-qm6p "CVE-2021-25741")**. Affected Components and Configurations This bug affects kubelet.  Environments where cluster administrators have restricted the ability to create hostPath mounts are the most seriously affected. Exploitation allows hostPath-like access without use of the hostPath feature, thus bypassing the restriction.  In a default Kubernetes environment, exploitation could be used to obscure misuse of already-granted privileges. Affected Versions v1.22.0 - v1.22.1  v1.21.0 - v1.21.4  v1.20.0 - v1.20.10  <= v1.19.14 Fixed Versions This issue is fixed in the following versions:  v1.22.2  v1.21.5  v1.20.11  v1.19.15 Mitigation To mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, and remove any existing Pods making use of the feature.  You can also use admission control to prevent less-trusted users from running containers as root to reduce the impact of successful exploitation. Detection If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io Additional Details See Kubernetes Issue [#104980](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) for more details. Acknowledgements This vulnerability was reported by Fabricio Voznika and Mark Wolters of Google.  Thanks as well to Ian Coldwater, Duffie Cooley, Brad Geesaman, and Rory McCune for the thorough security research that led to the discovery of this vulnerability. |

| Fix is here [#104253](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104253) When using VolumeSubpath feature, K8S mount the volume then bind mount the subpath and give that to the runtime. The source part of the mount (the subpath) is attacker controled, so we need to prevent symlink exchange attack. As the mount syscall take path and not file descriptor, we open the source path and check that it's in the volume, and we use `/proc/<kubelet pid>/fd/<final fd>`, a magic symlink that point to the open file/directory, thus closing the race condition. The bug here is that K8S doesn't use the mount syscall directly but it uses the mount command, and the default behavior of [utils-linux mount](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man8/mount.8.html) is to resolve symlink  ``` -c, --no-canonicalize               Don't canonicalize paths.  The mount command canonicalizes all paths (from  command               line  or  fstab) by default. ...  ```  so all the effort made to use `/proc/<kubelet pid>/fd/<final fd>` and confirm it's safe are reverted by utils-linux mount default behavior. The fix is just to pass `--no-canonicalize`, really nice finding. As all this happens before we call the runtime, we are still in the root mount namespace so we can mount over some directory, say /root/.ssh, so it's even a bit simpler than the [runc CVE-2021-30465 exploit (shameless plug :) )](https://blog.champtar.fr/runc-symlink-CVE-2021-30465/) |

| Hello [@champtar](https://github.com/champtar), reading in your comment i am still not sure if this is not fixed by [CVE-2017-1002101](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rqgw-vh6p-qf7j "CVE-2017-1002101") which you already mentioned above, looking into the solution key points:  ``` Resolve all the symlinks in the subpath. Starting with the base volume, open each path segment one by one, using the openat() syscall, and disallow symlinks. With each path segment, validate that the current path is within the base volume.  ```  Did someone verify this CVE is exploitable? |

| Fix for [CVE-2017-1002101](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rqgw-vh6p-qf7j "CVE-2017-1002101") creates a safe path using /proc/x/fd/y trick and pass this safe magic symlink to the mount binary that resolves (canonicalize) the link before passing it to the mount syscall, allowing the race condition again. What was missed in 2017 (and that's easy to miss) is the util-linux mount default behavior, if k8s was using mount syscall directly the fix would have been good. |

Hello Kubernetes Community,

A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user may be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files & directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.

This issue has been rated High ([CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)), and assigned CVE-2021-25741.

### Affected Components and Configurations

This bug affects kubelet.

Environments where cluster administrators have restricted the ability to create hostPath mounts are the most seriously affected. Exploitation allows hostPath-like access without use of the hostPath feature, thus bypassing the restriction.

In a default Kubernetes environment, exploitation could be used to obscure misuse of already-granted privileges.

### Affected Versions

* v1.22.0 - v1.22.1
* v1.21.0 - v1.21.4
* v1.20.0 - v1.20.10
* <= v1.19.14

### Fixed Versions

This issue is fixed in the following versions:

* v1.22.2
* v1.21.5
* v1.20.11
* v1.19.15

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, and remove any existing Pods making use of the feature.

You can also use admission control to prevent less-trusted users from running containers as root to reduce the impact of successful exploitation.

### Detection

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact secu...@kubernetes.io

### Additional Details

See Kubernetes Issue [#104980](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104980) for more details.

### Acknowledgements

This vulnerability was reported by Fabricio Voznika and Mark Wolters of Google.

Thanks as well to Ian Coldwater, Duffie Cooley, Brad Geesaman, and Rory McCune for the thorough security research that led to the discovery of this vulnerability.

Thank You,

CJ Cullen on behalf of the Kubernetes Security Response Committee
