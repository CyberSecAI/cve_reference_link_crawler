- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly restrict access to event information based on user roles and event status. Specifically, the `tribe-user-event-confirmations` shortcode allows users with at least the contributor role to view details of events they shouldn't have access to (draft, private, pending review, password-protected, and trashed events).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control, specifically a lack of authorization checks when using the `tribe-user-event-confirmations` shortcode.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Contributors can access information about events they are not supposed to see, including details of private, draft, and password-protected events. This can lead to information disclosure and could potentially be used to gain further access to sensitive data or parts of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a shortcode, specifically `[tribe-user-event-confirmations user="ANY_USER_ID"]`, which a contributor can add to a post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least a contributor role on the WordPress site. They need to be able to add a shortcode to a post. They also need to guess the user ID to view the events created by that user.
