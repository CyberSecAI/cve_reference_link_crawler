The provided content is related to CVE-2024-29082.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper access control within Vonets Industrial WiFi Bridge Relays and WiFi Bridge Repeaters. Specifically, unprotected `goform` endpoints allow unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284): Unprotected `goform` endpoints are accessible without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication and factory reset the device.
- Possible disclosure of sensitive information.
- Could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- Potential to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated access via unprotected `goform` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- Low attack complexity.
