The provided content relates to a fix for a regression issue in the Linux kernel's RDMA/rxe subsystem, specifically concerning the handling of UD (Unreliable Datagram) request packets. This fix is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A previous commit (689c5421bfe0) deferred length checking for UD QPs (Queue Pairs) to the `copy_data` function.
- This change introduced a regression where if a UD packet was too large for the receive buffer, `copy_data` would return an error, causing the UD QP to enter an error state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of oversized UD packets, leading to premature QP error state.
- The responder was not silently dropping invalid UD request packets as per the IBA specification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker sending oversized UD packets could force a UD QP into an error state, potentially disrupting RDMA communication.
- According to the IBA specification, invalid requests should be silently dropped by the responder and it should then wait for new request packet, this was not happening.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending UD packets with a payload size that exceeds the available receive buffer size of the receiving QP.
- This attack can be performed by any entity that can send packets to the target RDMA endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send RDMA packets to a target system utilizing UD QPs.
- Knowledge of the receive buffer size to craft a packet larger than this.
