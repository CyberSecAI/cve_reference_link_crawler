# multiple eval of `sqrt()` argument built in

Low

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-5jrj-52x8-m64h
Apr 25, 2024

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.3.10

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Summary

Using the `sqrt` builtin can result in multiple eval evaluation of side effects when the argument has side-effects. The bug is more difficult (but not impossible!) to trigger as of 0.3.4, when the unique symbol fence was introduced ([#2914](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2914)).

A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.

### Details

It can be seen that the `build_IR` function of the `sqrt` builtin doesn't cache the argument to the stack:

[vyper/vyper/builtins/functions.py](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/4595938734d9988f8e46e8df38049ae0559abedb/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L2151)

Line 2151
in
[4595938](/vyperlang/vyper/commit/4595938734d9988f8e46e8df38049ae0559abedb)

|  | def build\_IR(self, expr, args, kwargs, context): |
| --- | --- |

As such, it can be evaluated multiple times (instead of retrieving the value from the stack).

### PoC

With at least Vyper version `0.2.15+commit.6e7dba7` the following contract:

```
c: uint256

@internal
def some_decimal() -> decimal:
    self.c += 1
    return 1.0

@external
def foo() -> uint256:
    k: decimal = sqrt(self.some_decimal())
    return self.c
```

passes the following test:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.13;

import "../../lib/ds-test/test.sol";
import "../../lib/utils/Console.sol";
import "../../lib/utils/VyperDeployer.sol";

import "../ITest.sol";

contract ConTest is DSTest {
    VyperDeployer vyperDeployer = new VyperDeployer();

    ITest t;

    function setUp() public {
        t = ITest(vyperDeployer.deployContract("Test"));
    }

    function testFoo() public {
        uint256 val = t.foo();
        console.log(val);
        assert (val == 4);
    }
}
```
### Patches

Patched in [#3976](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3976).

### Impact

No vulnerable production contracts were found.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32649

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
