- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the column settings of LogView.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands in the context of another user's session by injecting malicious scripts through column settings in LogView. The attacker would need to obtain the POST request by other hypothetical attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the column settings in LogView in FortiAnalyzer. An attacker needs to be authenticated and able to manipulate the column settings to inject the malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated to FortiAnalyzer.
    - The attacker needs to be able to reach the LogView settings.
    - The attacker would need to obtain the POST request.
