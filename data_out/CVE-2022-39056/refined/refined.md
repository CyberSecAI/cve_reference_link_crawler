- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RAVA Certificate Verification System website does not validate user inputs in specific function parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries to read, modify, and delete database information without requiring any authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access, exploiting the vulnerable parameters of the RAVA Certificate Verification System website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication required, remote access to the vulnerable application is sufficient.
