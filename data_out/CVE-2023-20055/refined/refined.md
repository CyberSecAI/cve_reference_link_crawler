- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the unintended exposure of sensitive information in the management API of Cisco DNA Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unintended exposure of sensitive information, allowing privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access the API with the privileges of a higher-level user account, leading to privilege escalation within the web-based management interface.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by inspecting responses from the API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least valid *Observer* credentials to successfully exploit this vulnerability. They also need to be able to send requests to the management API.
