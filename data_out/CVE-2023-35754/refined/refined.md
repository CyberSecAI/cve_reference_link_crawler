{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the DDP service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DAP-2622 router.",
     "attack_vectors": "A network-adjacent attacker sends a specially crafted request to the DDP service with an oversized NMS URL, overflowing the stack buffer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be network-adjacent to the target device. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
