| Impact for 9p is basically the same as [CVE-2018-13405](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5p56-pcgw-42mf "CVE-2018-13405"), and the core misbehaviour described was [1], quote:  "The intended behavior is that the non-member user can trigger creation of a *directory* with group execution and SGID permission bits set whose group ownership is of that group, but not a plain *file*."  [1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi/?id=1599161>  The thing here is though, this behaviour seems to differ among OSes and even individual file systems: some would inherit permission bits to both newly created directories and files, and others only for new directories. XFS appears to have a config option fs.xfs.irix\_sgid\_inherit for that.  There is neither a specific behaviour restriction defined for either POSIX or Linux that would cover the described expected behaviour, no?  +CC Dominique, Eric (9pfs Linux client)  On Wednesday, March 1, 2023 4:26:49 PM CET Michael S.

As a result, in rare circumstances(exist an executable file owned by root, writable by others, has SUID/SGID bits), this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host's local user to elevate privileges on the host.  Environment:  • QEMU version: QEMU emulator version 6.2.0 • Host/Guest architecture: X86 • Host kernel version: 5.17.0-rc1 • Guest kernel version: 6.1.14  Configurations: We have tested it under different 9pfs configurations. The Qemu startup file is like this:  sudo qemu-system-x86\_64  -kernel /home/shawotao/tmp/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage  -append 'root=/dev/sda rw console=ttyS0'  -drive file=rootfs.img,format=raw  -M pc -cpu host --enable-kvm -smp 2  -m 2G  -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=mon -mon chardev=mon,mode=readline  -device virtio-serial-pci -device virtconsole,chardev=mon -vga none -display none  -virtfs local,path=/tmp/test,mount\_tag=myfs,security\_model=passthrough,id= fsdev0,writeout=immediate  Effected Configuration: fsdriver = local, all security model is affected, mount 9pfs with cache=mmap  Reproduce Steps:   1. Use the above configuration to startup QEMU. 2. Mount 9pfs in the guest: root@virt: ~# mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio myfs /    mnt -oversion=9p2000.L,posixacl,msize=512000,cache=mmap 3. Prepare an executable file owned by root, writable by others, and has SUID,    SGID: root@virt:/mnt# ./prepare\_suid\_file.sh 4. Change to a local user: root@virt:/mnt# su shawtao 5. Write the SGID/SUID executable file: shawtao@virt: ~# ./write   Root cause && fix suggestions:   1. Missing kill SUID/SGID check in v9fs\_file\_write\_iter(), so considering call    file\_modified() in v9fs\_file\_write\_iter() can solve the issue. 2. Normally, the host filesystem(i.e. ext4) can also help to clear the SUID/    SGID when using security\_model=none/passthrough. However, Qemu needs to run as    root with this setting, thus the CAP\_FSETID of the Qemu process helps the write    operation pass the host filesystem's check and keep the SUID/SGID. (So the 9p    server in Qemu can drop CAP\_FSETID on every write like what    virtfs-proxy-helper does)   Whom to Acknowledge for Reporting This Issue: Name: Jietao Xiao email: shawtao1125@gmail.com Name: Wenbo Shen email: shenwenbo@zju.edu.cn Name: Jinku Li email: jkli@xidian.edu.cn Name: Nanzi Yang email: nzyang@stu.xidian.edu.cn  Best regards Jietao Xiao  #!/bin/bash  dd if=/dev/zero of=suid\_file bs=1024 count=1  chmod u+s,g+s,o+w,ugo+x suid\_file |

| FWIW - I have a private branch where I've been looking to implement some additional protections in the fs/9p client. At the very least we should be doing what NFS is doing and clearing any cached meta-data when we detect the situation so that we pull the revised meta-data from the server. However, this still depends on the server (or the underlying served file system) doing the right thing. There's a more aggressive mode where we try to enforce the semantics from the client by sending extra messages, but assuming downstream is doing the right things that would duplicate effort and add latency and could lead to incorrect behavior - so I've held off on this. I'll try to finish up the meta-data clearing patches this week. If I had to guess why this was closed as NOTABUG it may be because the view is that there are mount/server configurations which prevent this problem (ie. don't let your 9p client write anything as root if you don't trust the guest/client and instead use mapped ids, etc.). … On Tue, Aug 8, 2023 at 4:56 AM Robert \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Is there any reasoning why this was closed as NOTABUG by RedHat that someone can share? — Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <[#29 (comment)](https://github.com/v9fs/linux/issues/29#issuecomment-1669304427)>, or unsubscribe <<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAQ7WFJ5AZWROHCCYVFSSDXUIEOFANCNFSM6AAAAAAVR2V4L4>> .

`[mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehash](/v9fs/linux/commit/743edc8547a92b6192aa1f1b6bb78233fa21dc9b "mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehash

As previously explained, the rehash delayed work migrates filters from
one region to another. This is done by iterating over all chunks (all
the filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk
iterating over all the filters.

When the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entry
as markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resume
the migration from the next time the work is scheduled.

Upon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting the
entry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migration
being resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being
migrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated
over as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to
be defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as
[1].

Fix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from
all the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For good
measures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add a
warning to avoid future cases.

syzbot reports that a recent fix causes nesting issues between the (now)
raw timeoutlock and the eventfd locking:

because after the preempt-rt fix for the timeout lock nesting inside
the io-wq lock, we now have the eventfd spinlock nesting inside the
raw timeout spinlock.

Rather than play whack-a-mole with other nesting on the timeout lock,
split the deletion and killing of timeouts so queueing the task_work
for the timeout cancelations can get done outside of the timeout lock.
