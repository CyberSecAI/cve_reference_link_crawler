The WP Helper Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'whp_smtp_send_mail_test' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails containing any content and originating from the vulnerable WordPress instance to any recipient.
