- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because a user-controlled search path is used to locate executable files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path. The application uses a user-controlled search path to locate executable files, which can lead to the execution of malicious files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device as the *root* user, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with valid credentials on an affected device can configure the application in a way that causes a malicious file to be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have local access to the affected device. They also require valid credentials.
