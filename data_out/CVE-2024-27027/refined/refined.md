The provided content relates to CVE-2024-27027.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The issue lies within the `dpll_xa_ref_dpll_del()` and `dpll_xa_ref_pin_del()` functions in the Linux kernel's DPLL (Digital Phase-Locked Loop) subsystem. These functions incorrectly remove registrations of pins/devices only when the reference count drops to zero. This is problematic when multiple registrations of the same pin exist on the same DPLL device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect reference counting logic in `dpll_xa_ref_dpll_del()` and `dpll_xa_ref_pin_del()` which leads to the registration not being removed when it should be.
- The registration was only removed and freed if the reference counter reached zero, causing a resource leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is the generation of warning messages due to the improper handling of registrations.
If not addressed this could lead to resource leaks due to unreleased memory.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker cannot directly trigger this vulnerability, but it could be triggered through normal system operation if multiple registrations of the same pin on the same DPLL device happen.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No specific attacker capabilities or position are required. The vulnerability is a logic error in the kernel that is exposed during normal operation.
