  "cve": "CVE-2024-35915",
  "description": "The provided content describes a fix for an uninitialized value read vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NFC subsystem, specifically within the `nci_rx_work()` function. This function is responsible for parsing and processing received NCI packets. The vulnerability occurs when a packet with a zero-size payload is received. In such cases, the message type handler would attempt to read from the uninitialized payload, leading to a potential issue. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the payload size is greater than zero before attempting to process the packet. If the payload size is zero, the packet is silently discarded by freeing the socket buffer (skb) and breaking out of the processing switch statement. This prevents access to the uninitialized payload.",
  "affected_component": "Linux kernel's NFC subsystem, specifically the `net/nfc/nci/core.c` file.",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of a check for zero-length payloads in the `nci_rx_work()` function before passing the packet to message type handlers.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Uninitialized value read"
  ],
  "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is the potential to cause undefined behavior or crashes due to reading uninitialized data. While the provided text doesn't specify if this leads to privilege escalation it is still a security issue.",
  "attack_vector": "An attacker could send specially crafted NCI packets with zero-length payloads to trigger the vulnerability. This is likely done through the NFC communication channel.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to transmit NFC packets to a vulnerable device. This could be achieved via physical proximity to a target or through other means if the system is exposing the NFC interface.",
    "fixes": [
    "The patch adds a check for a zero-length payload before passing control to message handlers.",
    "When the payload length is zero, the skb is freed and the processing is aborted."
  ],
    "additonal_info": "The vulnerability was reported by syzbot and has been confirmed to be fixed by the applied patch."
