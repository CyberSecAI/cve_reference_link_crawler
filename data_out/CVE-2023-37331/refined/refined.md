{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of GIF files within Kofax Power PDF. Specifically, there's a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data length when parsing GIF files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted GIF image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious GIF file or lure the user to a webpage containing it. No special privileges are required on the victim's system. User interaction is required for successful exploitation."
