- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VikRentCar plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in certain areas, specifically when handling requests to cancel or modify car rental orders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions, such as canceling or modifying a car rental order, without the user's consent or knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., via a link or embedded HTML form) that targets the vulnerable endpoint. If a logged-in user clicks on the malicious link, the browser sends the request to the server on behalf of the user. The server, lacking proper CSRF protection, processes this malicious request as if it were initiated by the legitimate user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or triggering an exploit through other means, such as a hidden iframe or manipulated HTML. The attacker does not need to have an account on the vulnerable site, but they do need to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
