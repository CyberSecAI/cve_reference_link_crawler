**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper control of the location where the driver update process searches for necessary files.
- Vulnerable to uncontrolled search path element usage.
- Allows for privilege escalation by Windows users with low-level privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to:
- Escalation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- Requires user interaction (administrator updating the driver).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-privileged Windows user.
- The attacker needs to wait for an administrator to update GPU drivers.

**Summary:**
