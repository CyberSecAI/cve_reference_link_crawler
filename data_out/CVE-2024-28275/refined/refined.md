The provided content relates to CVE-2024-28275.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 360Eyes Pro application transmits password change packets in cleartext over the network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
- Lack of encryption for password change requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can intercept password change packets.
- Attackers can obtain the MD5 hash of the old password.
- Attackers can change the user's password.
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network sniffing: Attackers passively monitor network traffic to intercept the cleartext password change packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the user during the password change process.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to sniff network traffic.
- The attacker needs to obtain the username and the MD5 hash of the old password.
