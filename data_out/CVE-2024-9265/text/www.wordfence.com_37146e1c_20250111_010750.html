### Description

The Echo RSS Feed Post Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting the roles that can set during registration through the echo\_check\_post\_header\_sent() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator.

Wordfence blocked **2 attacks** targeting this vulnerability in the past 24 hours.
