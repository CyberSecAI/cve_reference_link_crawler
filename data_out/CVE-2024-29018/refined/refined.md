The provided content is related to CVE-2024-29018.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from `dockerd` forwarding DNS requests from internal networks to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics. This is done to allow containers to resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper isolation of internal networks: Despite being designated as internal, these networks could inadvertently forward DNS requests to external nameservers.
- Bypassing container network namespace: `dockerd` forwards DNS requests from the host network namespace, which is outside the isolated container network.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exfiltrate data from a compromised container by encoding it in DNS queries to a domain they control. The `dockerd` daemon will forward these queries to the host's resolver which will send it to the attacker's DNS server, thus leaking the data.

**Attack vectors:**
A compromised container on an internal network attempts to resolve a domain name controlled by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs control of a container on an internal network and needs to have registered a domain with authoritative nameservers under their control. They also need to be able to execute arbitrary commands inside of the compromised container.
