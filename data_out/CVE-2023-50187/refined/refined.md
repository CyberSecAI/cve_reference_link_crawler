- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of SKP files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious SKP file or by visiting a malicious webpage, which could potentially deliver the malicious SKP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SKP file to the target or trick them into visiting a website that does. The user interaction is required, that is the user must open the malicious file.
