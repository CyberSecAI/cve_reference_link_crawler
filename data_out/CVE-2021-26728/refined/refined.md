Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-26728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `KillDupUsr_func` function of the `spx_restservice`.
- Specifically, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the use of `strcat` to copy an externally controllable HTTP parameter `username` into a fixed-size buffer without proper length checks.
- Additionally, the `safe_system` function executes the content of the overflowed buffer, enabling command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `strcat` function allows writing beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Command injection:** The `safe_system` executes the overflowed buffer content without proper sanitization, enabling execution of arbitrary OS commands.
- **Broken Access Control:** While not the core issue of the vulnerability, it's noted that the `KillDupUsr_func` function, which is meant to kill duplicate user sessions, lacks session verification, allowing unauthenticated access to this function which is a pre-requisite to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller).
- **Root Privileges:** The code is executed with root privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the BMC.
- **Compromised Managed Host:** Because the BMC has low-level access to the host system, successful exploitation allows the attacker to also gain control of the managed host.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** Although not the main impact of this vulnerability (CVE-2021-26728), the lack of session verification (CVE-2021-44467) enables an unauthenticated attacker to arbitrarily terminate active user sessions, causing a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests to the web interface of the Lanner IAC-AST2500A device.
- **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- **No Authentication:** No user credentials or prior authentication are required.
- **Basic Web Request:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the `/api/KillDupUsr` endpoint with a specially crafted username parameter in order to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes**
- The blog post highlights that multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Lanner BMC firmware based on AMI MegaRAC SP-X.
- The provided CVSS v3.1 score for CVE-2021-26728 is 10 (Critical).
- The vulnerability affects Lanner IAC-AST2500A devices, specifically version 1.10.0 of its firmware.
- The article also mentions that the vendor has released patches to address the issues, and users should contact Lanner for the appropriate firmware updates.
