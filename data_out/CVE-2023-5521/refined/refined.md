Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit aims to harden the signature check for KernelSU manager APKs. The original code had a vulnerability in how it verified the APK signature, which could be bypassed. The hardening involves a more robust verification process using SHA256 hash comparison of the certificate and additional checks based on the id of the signing block, supporting both v2 and v3 signing schemes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Signature Verification:** The original commit (before this change) did not properly verify the APK signature. This allowed for the possibility of using modified or malicious APKs by bypassing the existing verification.
*   **Reliance on simple hash:** Before this commit, a simple hash was used to verify the signature, this was not cryptographically secure and allowed for collisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the signature check is bypassed, a malicious or modified KernelSU manager APK could be installed, potentially granting the attacker root privileges on the affected device.
*   **System Compromise:** A compromised KernelSU manager could be used to further compromise the device, install malware, steal data, and perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious APK Installation:** An attacker could craft a malicious APK that bypasses the insecure signature verification and trick the user into installing it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Install APKs:** The attacker would need the ability to install an APK on the target device.
*   **Understanding of the original signature verification:** The attacker would need to understand the weaknesses in the original signature verification in order to create an APK that could bypass it.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   The commit modifies `kernel/apk_sign.c` to include more robust signature verification checks based on the APK's signing blocks and SHA256 hashes of certificates.
*   The commit introduces a function `check_block` which verifies certificate within the signing block against the expected SHA256 hash.
*   It supports both APK v2 and v3 signing schemes, identified by unique id values within the APK.
*   The `kernel/Makefile` is modified to define `EXPECTED_HASH` and `EXPECTED_SIZE` during compilation.
*   The `kernel/apk_sign.h` is modified to change the return type of `is_manager_apk` from `int` to `bool`.
*   `kernel/manager.c` is modified to correct the check of `is_manager_apk`, checking for a true value rather than 0.
*   The commit also introduces module parameters for debugging purposes, to allow external configuration of the expected signature parameters.
*   The commit aims to prevent using an APK with a different signature, which may be tampered with or be a malicious version.

The information provided is directly related to the hardening of the signature verification, which mitigates a potential vulnerability and thus is related to CVE-2023-5521.
