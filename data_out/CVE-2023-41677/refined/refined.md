- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability (CWE-522) exists in FortiOS and FortiProxy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability involves the leakage of the administrator cookie due to insufficient protection of credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the administrator cookie. With this, the attacker could execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack involves tricking the administrator into visiting a malicious, attacker-controlled website through the SSL-VPN. This requires user interaction, making it a less direct attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control a website and then trick a logged in administrator from a vulnerable system to visit the malicious website through the SSL-VPN.
