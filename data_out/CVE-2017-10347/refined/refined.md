Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2017-10347:

**CVE-2017-10347**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  Unbounded memory allocation during deserialization of `SimpleTimeZone` objects in OpenJDK. This implies a flaw in how the `SimpleTimeZone` class's deserialization logic handles incoming data streams, leading to a potential memory exhaustion issue.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is an uncontrolled memory allocation during the deserialization process. This occurs when data intended to create a `SimpleTimeZone` object is processed. The flaw allows the program to allocate an arbitrary amount of memory based on malicious input, exceeding available resources and potentially causing a denial of service or application instability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can provide a malicious serialized data stream that, when deserialized, triggers excessive memory allocation. This can result in memory exhaustion, causing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the application using the vulnerable code to crash or become unresponsive.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Deserialization:** This vulnerability is triggered through the deserialization process of untrusted Java objects. Any application that deserializes data from an untrusted source, such as a file, a network stream, or user input is potentially vulnerable.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Supply Malicious Data:** An attacker needs the ability to supply crafted, serialized data that will be deserialized by the vulnerable application. This can be achieved by:
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** If an application deserializes data from a network stream, a MitM attacker can modify the data being sent to include malicious serialized payloads
        *   **Direct Injection:** In cases where applications read serialized data from files, an attacker can replace such files with their malicious counterparts,
        *   **User-Supplied Input:** Vulnerabilities may also stem from allowing user input to be deserialized, as users may provide maliciously constructed serialized data.

*   **Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**
    *   The vulnerability affects the `Serialization` component within OpenJDK, further narrowing the area of exploitation.
    *   The vulnerability has been fixed in IBM Java SE 7 version 7R1 SR4-FP15 and IBM Java SE 8 version 8 SR5-FP5, according to RHSA-2017:3268 and RHSA-2017:3264.
    *  Oracle Java SE versions 6u161, 7u151, 8u144, and 9 are also affected and have been patched with fixes in CPU October 2017, according to an Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory
   *  The vulnerability is also present in `dev-java/icedtea-bin` versions prior to 3.6.0

**Summary of CVE-2017-10347:** This vulnerability arises from insecure deserialization within the `SimpleTimeZone` class, allowing for a denial-of-service attack through unbounded memory allocation. An attacker, with the ability to supply a malicious serialized object, can cause the vulnerable system to crash by triggering the allocation.
