Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `formIPMacBindAdd` function of Tenda W15EV1.0 firmware. This occurs because the `IPMacBindRule` parameter from a POST request is not properly validated and is copied into a fixed-size stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the attacker-controlled `IPMacBindRule` into a fixed-size buffer `inputList` on the stack within the `ipMacBindListStore` function. When the input exceeds the buffer's capacity, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.
- **Lack of input validation:** There is no proper size check or sanitization performed on the `IPMacBindRule` parameter before copying it into the stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting the execution flow to attacker-controlled code or achieve denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/addIpMacBind` endpoint, with a long string provided as the `IPMacBindRule` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the device.
- **Ability to send HTTP POST requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with a crafted body.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `ipMacBindListStore`. The `inputList` buffer is overflowed using a long string provided as the value of `IPMacBindRule`
- The PoC code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a POST request with a large amount of `a`s in the `IPMacBindRule` parameter.
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda W15EV1.0 V15.11.0.14.
- The code provided confirms that the overflow occurs due to the use of `strcpy` to copy the `listStr` parameter into `inputList`.
