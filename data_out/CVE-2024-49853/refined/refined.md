Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-49853.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double-free condition in the ARM SCMI OPTEE transport driver within the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free: The code attempts to free the same memory region (channel descriptors) more than once during the unloading of the stack. This occurs when channels are shared between different protocols.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: Double frees can lead to memory corruption, which may allow an attacker to control the execution flow of the kernel.
- System instability: The memory corruption can cause the system to crash or behave unpredictably.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when unloading the SCMI OPTEE transport driver stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger the unloading of the SCMI OPTEE driver. This could involve loading and unloading specific modules or interacting with the related kernel interfaces.
