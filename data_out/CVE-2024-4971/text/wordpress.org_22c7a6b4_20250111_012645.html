Learnpress is a good plugin for managing and selling courses. Very good plugin, really. It has a multitude of well-thought-out functions, the management is intuitive, many add-ons and if you combine it with Woocommerce (instead of using its native checkount), sales improve a lot.
The support is very dedicated and willing to help.
All of this being FREE.
It is almost at the level of paid competitors.
Bad things:
Could be improved in terms of performance speed. Requires page load reduction work.
Low integration with subscription systems for the sale of courses. There are plugins that help, you can sell by subscription with LP, but plugin could increase communication between the plugins and improve automations. (PMPO is not a good partner to sell subscriptions and the other two “big” subscriptions plugins aren’t be totally connected to LP).
The use of language files for translation could be improved.
But in general it is a very efficient plugin for a learning website and with many constant improvements.
And seriously, very good support.
