### Description

The Cookie Information | Free GDPR Consent Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary option updates due to a missing capability check on its AJAX request handler in versions up to, and including, 2.0.22. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to edit arbitrary site options which can be used to create administrator accounts.
