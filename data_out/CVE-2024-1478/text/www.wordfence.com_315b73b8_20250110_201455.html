### Description

The Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 via the REST API. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain post and page content via API thus bypassing the content protection provided by the plugin.
