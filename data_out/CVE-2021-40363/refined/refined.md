- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected component stores credentials of a local system account in a potentially publicly accessible project file using an outdated cipher algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of an outdated cipher algorithm for storing credentials, leading to weak encryption. The project file containing these credentials might be publicly accessible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially brute-force the encrypted credentials and take over the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the affected system and the project file is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and access to the project file containing the encrypted credentials, as indicated by the CVSS vector "AV:L/AC:L/PR:L". The attacker must also have the ability to brute force the outdated cipher.
