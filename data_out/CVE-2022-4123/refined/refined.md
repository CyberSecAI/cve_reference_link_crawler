Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-4123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Podman handles context directories during remote builds. Specifically, the context directory was not being correctly added to the tar archive that gets sent to the remote build server. This omission caused the remote build process to be unable to locate and stat the context directory.

The issue was introduced by the fix implemented in [PR #13531](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/13531) which aimed to address a different issue where remote builds with relative context directories were failing. However, this fix inadvertently introduced a path disclosure vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is a path disclosure. When using `podman --remote build` with an empty context directory, the absolute path of the directory might be included in the container image.
*   **Incorrect Path Handling:** The core issue lies in the incorrect handling of context paths during the build process. The changes in the mentioned PR caused the absolute path of the context directory to potentially be included.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality. The disclosure of the absolute path of a local directory, though considered low severity by the reporter, can potentially expose sensitive information about the build environment.
*   **Limited Scope:** The impact is limited because the disclosed path is usually that of an empty context directory used for building container images, and the disclosed path is considered "not that sensitive". It's important to note that the lowest subdirectory might not always be disclosed, further limiting the scope.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Build Process:** The vulnerability is triggered specifically during remote builds using the `podman --remote build` command.
*   **Empty Context Directory:** The path disclosure is more likely to occur when an empty context directory is used for the build.
*   **Container Image:** The path is disclosed in the container image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User with Podman Access:** An attacker needs to be a user who can execute `podman` commands.
*   **Remote Build Initiation:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a remote build, and provide an empty context directory.
*   **Knowledge of the Build Process:** The attacker would need to understand that the absolute path of the context directory is potentially logged in the image.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Podman version `v4.1.0-rc1` due to changes made in [PR #13531](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/13531).
*   The issue was initially reported as a low-severity information disclosure.
*   The fix for the original issue involved adding the context directory to the tar archive, which inadvertently led to this path disclosure.
*   Multiple bugzilla entries track the vulnerability across different Fedora versions.

In summary, CVE-2022-4123 is a path disclosure vulnerability in Podman, specifically affecting remote builds when using an empty context directory. The absolute path of this directory might be exposed in the resulting container image, although the severity of this information disclosure is considered low due to the nature of the disclosed data and its limited impact. The vulnerability stems from the changes made in PR #13531, which aimed to fix a different issue but inadvertently introduced this path exposure.
