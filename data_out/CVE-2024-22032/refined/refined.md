Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how RKE1 clusters handle secrets encryption configurations. Specifically, when secrets encryption is enabled, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext within the `AppliedSpec` of the cluster object. This occurs during the reconciliation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Plaintext Storage of Secrets:** Sensitive data, specifically the secrets encryption configuration, including the encryption keys themselves, are stored in plaintext within the cluster's `AppliedSpec`.
- **Inadequate Data Handling:** The system doesn't properly sanitize or remove sensitive information from the `AppliedSpec` during reconciliation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Encryption Keys:** Attackers with sufficient RBAC permissions can access the cluster object and view the plaintext encryption keys stored in the `AppliedSpec`.
- **Compromise of Secrets Encryption:** By obtaining the encryption keys, an attacker can potentially decrypt all secrets in the affected cluster. This could lead to a full cluster compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Kubernetes cluster can lead to data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the Kubernetes API server.
- **RBAC Access:** Attackers need to have at least "low" privileges as Cluster owners, Cluster members, or Project members to view cluster object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Ability to communicate with the Kubernetes API server.
- **RBAC Permissions:**  Must possess RBAC permissions that allow them to view cluster objects. This includes Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members (within the cluster).

**Additional Notes:**

- **Specific to RKE1:** This vulnerability only affects clusters provisioned using RKE1 with secrets encryption enabled.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available; users must upgrade to patched versions.
- **Manual Key Rotation:** The vulnerability requires users to manually rotate keys by editing the cluster.

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability is addressed in Rancher versions `2.7.14` and `2.8.5`. The fix involves copying the `AppliedSpec` before mutation to ensure sensitive data is removed during reconciliation.

**CWEs:**

- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords
