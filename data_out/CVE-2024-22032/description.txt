A vulnerability has been identified in which an RKE1 cluster keeps 
constantly reconciling when secrets encryption configuration is enabled.
 When reconciling, the Kube API secret values are written in plaintext 
on the AppliedSpec. Cluster owners, Cluster members, and Project members
 (for projects within the cluster), all have RBAC permissions to view 
the cluster object from the apiserver.
