- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management in the Embedded Service Router (ESR) console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper privilege management allows for privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with valid administrator-level privileges can escalate their privileges to root, and read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the affected device via the ESR console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid *Administrator-*level privileges on the affected Cisco ISE device and the Embedded Service Router (ESR) must be enabled.
