Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `installThemePlugin` parameter within the `installUpdateThemePluginAction` function in `index.php` of WonderCMS. This function is responsible for installing or updating themes and plugins.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fetches the content from a URL provided in the `installThemePlugin` parameter using `curl_exec` without sufficient validation. This allows an attacker to control the destination URL, making the server send requests to arbitrary locations.
- **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization:** The `installThemePlugin` parameter is not adequately sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs. The provided PoC demonstrates that URL encoding or other filters are not sufficient to block an attacker from injecting a malicious URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Requests:** An attacker can force the WonderCMS server to make requests to internal or external URLs.
- **Information Disclosure:** By sending requests to internal services, the attacker might be able to probe for sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to overload other services by forcing the WonderCMS server to send many requests to a target.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `index.php` file.
- **`installThemePlugin` Parameter:** The malicious URL is injected via the `installThemePlugin` parameter.
- **`type` Parameter:** The `type` parameter must be set to `plugins` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WonderCMS instance to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WonderCMS server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable parameter `installThemePlugin` and how to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `installUpdateThemePluginAction` function in the `index.php` file.
- The vulnerability affects WonderCMS version 3.1.3, and PHP version 7.x.
- The exploit occurs when downloading updates for plugins.
- The code provided shows how the `$url` is taken from the `$_REQUEST['installThemePlugin']` without validation.
- The provided curl command demonstrates the exploit using a crafted `installThemePlugin` URL parameter to redirect the server to an arbitrary target. The attacker also bypasses the security filtering by appending a `#` and a github url.
