Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper data authorization when creating new datasets in Apache Superset. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how Superset handles custom roles with "can write on dataset" permissions, but without full data access permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** Users with the "can write on dataset" permission could create virtual datasets based on data they do not have direct access to. This allows them to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** By creating these virtual datasets, attackers can gain access to sensitive data that they should not be able to view or manipulate. This can lead to confidentiality breaches and potentially other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Application Level:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web application interface by a user with specific permissions within Superset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a user with a custom role that includes the "can write on dataset" permission but lacks full data access permissions.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the Superset application.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows users with specific dataset creation privileges, but lacking broader data access, to circumvent access controls by creating virtual datasets pointing to unauthorized data. This results in the potential for data breaches. The fix involves upgrading to Apache Superset version 3.1.1 or 3.0.4.
