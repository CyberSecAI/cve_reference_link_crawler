For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndb-mhcvuln-vpsBPJ9y>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco Nexus Dashboard.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Note:** For releases earlier than Release 2.0(1d), Cisco Nexus Dashboard was known as Cisco Application Services Engine. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Nexus Dashboard is deployed as a cluster, connecting each service node to two networks:    + Data network (fabric0, fabric1)   + Management network (mgmt0, mgmt1) For more information about these interfaces, see the [Cisco Nexus Dashboard Deployment Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nd/2x/deployment/cisco-nexus-dashboard-deployment-guide-221/nd-deploy-overview-22x.html#concept_fdf_fxg_4mb).  The scope of these exploits can be limited to the network interfaces that have exposure. The following vulnerability descriptions indicate whether the data network, the management network, or both networks have exposure to the vulnerability.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.  **CVE-2022-20857: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a specific API that is running in the data network and execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a specific API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user in any pod on a node.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwa93560](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa93560)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20857Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2022-20861: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web UI that is running in the management network of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated administrator of the web-based management interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions with *Administrator* privileges on an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwa75451](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa75451)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20861Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.8CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  **CVE-2022-20858: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Container Image Read and Write Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a service that is running in the data and management networks on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a service that manages container images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a TCP connection to the affected service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download container images or upload malicious container images to an affected device. The malicious images would be run after the device has rebooted or a pod has restarted.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCwb24518](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb24518)CVE ID: CVE-2022-20858Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.2CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.  Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate [fixed software release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in this section.       | Cisco Nexus Dashboard Release | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | 1.11 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 2.0 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 2.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 2.2 | 2.2(1e) |      1.
