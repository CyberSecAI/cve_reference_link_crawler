- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zebra IP routing manager allows setting the "Message of the Day" (MOTD) banner from an arbitrary file on disk. This functionality can be exploited to disclose the contents of sensitive files by setting the banner to a file like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insufficient input validation or lack of access control. The Zebra service allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file to be used as the MOTD banner, leading to arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read sensitive files on the device, potentially disclosing user credentials, system information, and other confidential data.
- **Attack vectors**: A network request to the Zebra service running on TCP port 2601.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service running on the D-LINK DIR-3040 router on TCP port 2601. This typically implies the attacker must be on the same network as the router.
