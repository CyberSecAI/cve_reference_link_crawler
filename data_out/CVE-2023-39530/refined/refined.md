Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `CustomerMessage` API within PrestaShop. Specifically, the `delete()` function within `classes/CustomerMessage.php` was using `@unlink` on the provided file name, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Deletion:** The code directly uses the provided `$this->file_name` in an `unlink` call. This allows an attacker to manipulate the filename to delete arbitrary files on the server, since it was possible to provide relative paths like `../../`.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There appears to be no validation or sanitization of the filename before it's used in the `unlink` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A high-privileged attacker can delete any file that the webserver user has access to. This includes configuration files, application code, and potentially other sensitive data. This could lead to a complete compromise of the application and server.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deleting key application files would likely make the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network through the `CustomerMessage` API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attacker requires network access to the vulnerable PrestaShop instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PrestaShop versions 8.1.0 and earlier.
*   The fix implemented in version 8.1.1 involves using `basename()` to sanitize the filename before passing it to `unlink`, which prevents path traversal attacks.
*   The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a moderate severity.
*   The attack complexity is low, privileges required is high, no user interaction is required. Scope is unchanged. The confidentiality impact is none, while the integrity and availability impact is high.

In summary, this vulnerability allows a high-privileged attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server via the `CustomerMessage` API due to insecure use of `unlink()` without proper sanitization of the filename, leading to a potential denial of service or full system compromise.
