Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the list endpoints of Flyte Admin. Malicious users can inject custom SQL statements through REST requests by manipulating list filters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists due to lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-provided input in list filter requests.
- The application fails to distinguish between control and data planes, allowing injection of SQL commands within data input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can send crafted REST requests with malicious SQL statements embedded within list filters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the flyteadmin installation.
-  Typically, this requires being behind a VPN or having authentication credentials.
- The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- Some user interaction is needed, as a request needs to be made.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID **CVE-2023-41891**.
- The affected versions of the `github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin` package are below **1.1.124**.
- The patched version is **1.1.124**.
