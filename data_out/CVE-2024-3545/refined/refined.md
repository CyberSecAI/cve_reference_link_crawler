Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3545:

**CVE Description:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper permission handling in the vault offline cache feature.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in how Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager and Devolutions Server handle permissions related to the offline vault cache. Even when offline mode is disabled, an attacker can potentially access sensitive information within the cache file if they gain access to a computer with the software installed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the offline cache.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to gain access to the computer where the vulnerable software is installed. The attacker does not need to be a user of the software.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs local access to a computer where the vulnerable software (Remote Desktop Manager or Devolutions Server) is installed. The user who has RDM or DVLS is not necessarily an admin on that machine so a privilege escalation exploit may be needed before the vulnerable cache file can be accessed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager 2024.1.20 and earlier on Windows and Devolutions Server 2024.1.8 and earlier.
*   The severity is rated as "Low" with a CVSS score of 2.0
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading Remote Desktop Manager to version 2024.1.21.0 or higher and Devolutions Server to version 2024.1.9.0 or higher. Both products must be patched to fully resolve the vulnerability.
