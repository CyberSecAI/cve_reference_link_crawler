# CVE-2024-32462: Sandbox escape via RequestBackground portal and CWE-88

High

[smcv](/smcv)
published
GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj
Apr 18, 2024

## Package

Flatpak
(freedesktop.org)

## Affected versions

< 1.10.9, 1.12.x < 1.12.9, 1.14.x < 1.14.6, 1.15.x < 1.15.8

## Patched versions

1.15.8, 1.10.x >= 1.10.9, 1.12.x >= 1.12.9, 1.14.x >= 1.14.6

## Description

Gergo Koteles discovered a sandbox escape when using Flatpak in conjunction with xdg-desktop-portal.

### Impact

A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox.

### Description

Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. For example:

```
flatpak run --command=ls org.gnome.gedit

```

The original implementation of this was subject to CWE-88: in Flatpak versions that have this vulnerability, it is possible to pass a long option name to `--command=`, such as `--bind`, and it will be misinterpreted as a `bwrap` option. For example, one may do

```
flatpak run --command=--bind org.gnome.gedit / /host ls -l /host

```

Which will run:

```
bwrap ...lots of stuff... --bind / /host ls -l /host

```

It is possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. Normally this is safe, because it can only specify a command that exists inside the sandbox; but when a crafted `commandline` is converted into a `--command` and arguments, the app could achieve the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and therefore achieve sandbox escape.

The solution is for Flatpak to use the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options, before appending the attacker-specified command. The `--` argument has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0, and all supported versions of Flatpak already require at least that version of bubblewrap.

A mitigation is that `xdg-desktop-portal` versions 1.18.4 and 1.16.1 no longer allow Flatpak apps to create new `.desktop` files for commands that start with `-`.

### Patches

For the supported stable branches, this is fixed in 1.10.x ≥ 1.10.9, 1.12.x ≥ 1.12.9, 1.14.x ≥ 1.14.6.

For the development branch, this is fixed in version 1.15.8. As a reminder, all branches of the form 1.*odd*.*x* are development versions which do not have ongoing support.

* 1.15.x: fixed by [bbab7ed1](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931), regression test added by [84984e49](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/84984e494899a9796e0fd63642b1ff0e6a8e64e1)
* 1.14.x: fixed by [b7c1a558](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e), regression test added by [4fa5156e](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4fa5156efb384c3ceca61c28c853f392d4fcaa3a)
* 1.12.x: fixed by [81abe2a3](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97), regression test added by [e19d3cdf](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/e19d3cdfa167cfcaa423d8ece1e76f34e8a0a05c)
* 1.10.x: fixed by [72016e3f](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d), regression test added by [25ef001b](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/25ef001b1e7beada447094cf86fb68b904021498)

If long-term support distributions want to backport the fix to older versions, the changes that were made in 1.10.x are likely to be the closest match. In very old versions, it might be necessary to either upgrade bubblewrap, or use `env` instead of `--`.

### Workarounds

`xdg-desktop-portal` versions 1.18.4 and 1.16.1 mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create `.desktop` files for commands that do not start with `-`.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32462

### Weaknesses

[CWE-88](/advisories?query=cwe%3A88)
