Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0796:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

   - The content from `wordfence.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-0796` and describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the "Active Products Tables for WooCommerce. Professional products tables for WooCommerce store" plugin.
   - The Wordfence description aligns with the characteristics of a CSRF vulnerability.
  - The provided `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content includes changeset details for this plugin.
  - Therefore, the content is related to CVE-2024-0796.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in several AJAX action functions within the plugin. This lack of proper security checks allows attackers to forge requests.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      -   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
      - Missing or incorrect nonce validation for AJAX actions
      
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Unauthenticated attackers can potentially invoke plugin functions by tricking a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.
      -  This could lead to unauthorized modifications of plugin settings, data manipulation or other malicious actions, which could affect the plugin's functionality or data.  Wordfence notes that, "This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link". The impact is listed as "low" by Wordfence.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
      -  The attack vector is network-based.
      -  Attackers use a forged HTTP request that exploits the missing nonce validation.
      
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      -   Attackers need the ability to trick a site administrator into initiating a forged request (e.g. via malicious link).
      -   Attackers do NOT need to authenticate or have any level of privilege in the target web application, but do need to be able to get the site administrator to visit the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content shows the changeset related to the fix of this issue, demonstrating the identified files modified as well.
- Wordfence provides a link to the plugin's Trac changeset log.
