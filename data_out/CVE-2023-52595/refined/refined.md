{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The rt2x00 driver does not properly handle the beacon queue after a hardware reset. When a hardware reset occurs, all queues are forced to stop at the hardware interface level. However, the mac80211 subsystem does not automatically stop the beacon queue. If the beacon queue is not manually stopped, it becomes deadlocked, preventing it from restarting.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of hardware reset events in the rt2x00 driver.",
      "Lack of synchronization between the hardware and software states of the beacon queue."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a deadlock in the beacon queue, preventing devices from connecting to access points (APs) after a hardware reset. This can cause a denial of service, specifically for wireless connectivity.",
    "attack_vectors": "Triggering a hardware reset on devices using the affected rt2x00 wireless driver.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a hardware reset on a device using the vulnerable rt2x00 driver. This could potentially occur through various means, such as software interactions or potentially manipulating hardware states."
  },
  "patch": {
    "description": "The patch addresses the vulnerability by manually stopping the beacon queue when a hardware reset occurs. This is achieved by adding a call to `rt2x00queue_stop_queue(rt2x00dev->bcn)` in the `rt2x00lib_disable_radio()` function and by clearing the enable_beacon flag and clearing the beacon in `rt2x00mac_bss_info_changed` when a reset is detected. Additionally, the patch adds `rt2x00dev->intf_beaconing = 0;` in `rt2x00lib_start()` and `rt2x00lib_stop()`.",
    "changes": [
      "drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2x00dev.c: Added `rt2x00queue_stop_queue(rt2x00dev->bcn);` to `rt2x00lib_disable_radio()`.",
      "drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2x00dev.c: Added `rt2x00dev->intf_beaconing = 0;` to `rt2x00lib_start()` and `rt2x00lib_stop()`.",
      "drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/rt2x00mac.c: Added logic to clear the `enable_beacon` flag and the beacon itself when `DEVICE_STATE_RESET` flag is set in `rt2x00mac_bss_info_changed()`."
