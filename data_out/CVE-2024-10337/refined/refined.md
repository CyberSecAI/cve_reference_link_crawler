{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and possibly gaining unauthorized access to the database or the underlying system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `/Online_Shopping/admin/home.php?con=add` endpoint.",
	  "The vulnerable parameters are 'cat', 'subcat', 't1', 't2', and 'text' within the multipart POST request."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to send HTTP requests. Administrative login is needed to access the vulnerable endpoint. A tool such as Burp Suite can intercept the request to modify the parameters."
