The provided content relates to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `DC_LOG_DC` calls were made before checking if `link->link_enc` was successfully created, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **REVERSE_INULL (Potential Null Pointer Dereference):** The code attempts to access members of `link->link_enc` via `DC_LOG_DC` before verifying that `link->link_enc` is not NULL. If `link->link_enc` creation fails, it could lead to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference could lead to a system crash or undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to cause the `link_enc_create` function to fail, resulting in a NULL `link->link_enc` pointer.
- This would likely occur during display initialization or when the system configures the display hardware.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the environment or configuration in such a way that the `link_enc_create` operation will fail. This may involve providing invalid parameters, causing a resource allocation failure, or other means.
