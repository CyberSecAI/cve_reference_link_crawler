- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability occurs when calling the Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authorization bypass
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the authorization checks implemented by OpenFGA, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Calling the Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the OpenFGA Check API and construct a query using the specific vulnerable expressions.
