Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22261:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the Harbor scan log API. Specifically, the code in `src/pkg/task/task.go` uses raw SQL that is vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `GET /api/v2.0/projects/{project_name}/repositories/{repository_name}/artifacts/{reference}/scan/{report_id}/log` endpoint. The `report_id` parameter is not properly sanitized, leading to the ability to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrator, project\_admin, or project\_maintainer roles could exploit the SQL injection to execute arbitrary Postgres functions.
- Although the vulnerability is present, the query result is only an intermediate result that does not leak any database content directly to the response. The vulnerability can execute SQL functions but can't leak any useful information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted `GET` request to the specified API endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `report_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have one of the following roles in Harbor: administrator, project\_admin, or project\_maintainer.
- The attacker needs network access to the Harbor API endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions >=v2.8.1, >=2.9.0, >=2.10.0 of Harbor.
- The issue is fixed in versions v2.8.6, v2.9.4, and v2.10.2.
- There is no workaround for the issue, users should upgrade to patched versions of Harbor.
- The SQL is executed using `ormer.Raw(Sql).QueryRows()`, which uses PrepareStatement. In Postgres, a PrepareStatement must contain only one SQL command, limiting the ability to append additional SQL operations, thus reducing the exploitability of the injection to simply executing SQL functions.
