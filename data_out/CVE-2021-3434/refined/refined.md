The provided content is related to CVE-2021-3434.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `le_ecred_conn_req()` function within the L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) implementation in Zephyr RTOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This suggests a limited impact on the system, likely leading to denial of service, code execution or data corruption depending on the specific exploit.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack vector (AV:L).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- High attack complexity (AC:H) indicates that the conditions to trigger this vulnerability are not trivial.
- No privileges required (PR:N).
- No user interaction required (UI:N).
