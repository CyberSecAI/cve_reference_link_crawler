* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: IBM Security QRadar EDR Software has multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-35006, CVE-2023-33859, CVE-2023-33860, CVE-2023-35008)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Security QRadar EDR Software is vulnerable to link injection and could also allow an attacker to embed links (URLs) to an external site or to different pages. Sensitive information could also be disclosed due to an observable login response discrepancy and web pages could be stored locally which can be read by another user on the system. These vulnerabilities have been addressed in the update.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2023-35006](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/297165)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Security QRadar EDR | 3.12 |

## Remediation/Fixes

**IBM encourages customers to upgrade their systems promptly.**

The IBM Security QRadar EDR operator can be upgraded automatically when new compatible versions are available. However, you can control whether an operator is upgraded automatically by setting an approval strategy.

Two approval strategies are available:

* Automatic (default) - New operator versions are installed automatically when they are available on the subscription channel.
* Manual - When a new operator version is available on the subscription channel, the subscription indicates that an update is available, but you must approve the update manually.

For more information about the manual installation process, view [Installing QRadar EDR](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-security/3.12?topic=installing-qradar-edr)

| **Product** | **Fix version** |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Security QRadar EDR | 3.12.8 |

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
