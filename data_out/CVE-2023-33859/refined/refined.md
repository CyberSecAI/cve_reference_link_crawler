- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of link injection, observable login response discrepancy, and the ability to store web pages locally that could be accessed by other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Link injection: The software is vulnerable to link injection, allowing attackers to embed malicious URLs.
    - Observable login response discrepancy: The login process exhibits a discrepancy that could be used to glean sensitive information.
    - Local storage of web pages: Web pages can be stored locally and read by other system users.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Malicious links could be injected, potentially leading to phishing attacks or drive-by downloads.
    - Sensitive information may be disclosed due to observable login response discrepancies.
    - Locally stored web pages could be read by unauthorized users, exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vectors are not explicitly detailed, but the description suggests that a remote attacker could inject malicious URLs and other users on the same system may access locally stored sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need the ability to interact with the QRadar EDR software to inject links and potentially have access to the system where web pages are stored to read the data.
