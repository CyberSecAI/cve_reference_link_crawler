Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41121:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Array AG OS before release 9.4.0.499 contains a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to cause system service processes to crash through abnormal HTTP operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Array AG OS handles HTTP operations, specifically when they are "abnormal". This suggests a lack of proper input validation or error handling within the HTTP processing component of the OS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This occurs because system service processes crash, making the affected system unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending specially crafted or abnormal HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device. This suggests they must have network connectivity to the targeted system and that the affected service is exposed over the network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Array AG/vxAG series products running ArrayOS AG 9.x versions, specifically versions 9.4.0.495 and earlier.
- The vulnerability does not affect AVX, APV, and ASF products.
- A fix is available in Array AG release 9.4.0.499.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.
