The provided content is related to CVE-2023-25199.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the web application's failure to sanitize user input. Specifically, the application does not properly handle JavaScript or HTML code included in the URL, allowing it to be executed within a victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of input sanitization.
- HTML Injection: The application allows HTML to be injected into the page, which can be used for malicious purposes (e.g., phishing links).
- Exposure of sensitive information: The webserver exposes the "web.config" file and full server path during 404 errors.
- Lack of encryption on the web server

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the URL that, when visited by a user, could execute within the userâ€™s browser session. This could lead to various impacts, including:
- Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- Stealing user session cookies.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Defacement of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulation of the URL by injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL of the web server. This can be achieved through methods such as:
  - Direct manipulation by the attacker.
  - Phishing attacks which trick users into clicking on a malicious link.
  -  Malicious advertising, which redirects users to an attacker-controlled site with the injected payload

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found on a Mettler Toledo Safeline X3310 X-Ray machine running NXG version 19.05.
- The web server was observed to be hosted on port 80, with no encryption
- The vendor, Mettler Toledo, was notified, but had not responded by the time of the report.
- There is no patch known for this vulnerability.
- Mitigation measures include restricting access to the system and implementing server-side protections such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
