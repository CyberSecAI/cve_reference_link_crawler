- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of exceptional conditions while processing malformed commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The WatchGuard Single Sign-On Client for Windows fails to properly handle malformed commands, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by repeatedly sending malformed commands, preventing the computer from completing the SSO process.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required. An attacker must be able to send commands to the vulnerable client on TCP port 4116.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable WatchGuard Single Sign-On Client and must be able to send malformed commands to the client. The attacker does not require any authentication, as the vulnerability is triggered by malformed commands sent over the network.
