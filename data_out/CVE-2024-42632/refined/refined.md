- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create arbitrary pages on the victim's site by tricking them into submitting a crafted form.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page or link that forces the victim's browser to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `page/add` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit their malicious page or click on a malicious link. The attacker also needs to know the structure of the request (e.g., parameter names and values).
