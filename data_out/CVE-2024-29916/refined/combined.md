# Unsaflok

Unsaflok is a series of serious security vulnerabilities in dormakaba’s Saflok electronic RFID locks, commonly used in hotels and multi-family housing environments.

When combined, the identified weaknesses **allow an attacker to unlock all rooms in a hotel using a single pair of forged keycards**. Over three million hotel locks in 131 countries are affected.

The vulnerabilities were reported to dormakaba in September of 2022 and disclosed in March 2024 by [Lennert Wouters](https://twitter.com/LennertWo), [Ian Carroll](https://ian.sh), [rqu](https://twitter.com/rqu53), [BusesCanFly](https://twitter.com/BusesCanFly), [Sam Curry](https://twitter.com/samwcyo), [sshell](https://twitter.com/sshell_), and [Will Caruana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-caruana).

> Our slides from DEF CON 32, which contain additional technical information about these vulnerabilities, are now available [here](https://unsaflok.com/videos/slides.pdf).

## FAQs

### What locks are impacted?

The vulnerability impacts over 3 million doors on over 13,000 properties in 131 countries. All locks using the Saflok system are impacted, including (but not limited to) Saflok MT, the Quantum Series, the RT Series, the Saffire Series and the Confidant Series.

These are primarily used in hotels where the management software is System 6000 or Ambiance. Some applications in the multifamily housing space which use System 6000 or Community are also affected.

Saflok MT and Saflok RT Plus (pictured below) are the most common models of impacted locks. Note that while it is possible to visually identify a Saflok lock, it is not possible to visually see if the locks have been patched.

### Have the vulnerabilities been fixed?

Dormakaba started working on a fix after they received our vulnerability report, and began upgrading hotels in November of 2023. As of 03/2024, approximately 36% of the impacted locks have been updated or replaced.

Upgrading each hotel is an intensive process. All locks require a software update or have to be replaced. Additionally, all keycards have to be reissued, front desk software and card encoders have to be upgraded, and 3rd party integrations (e.g. elevators, parking garages and payment systems) may require additional upgrades.

We are disclosing limited information on the vulnerability now to ensure hotel staff and guests are aware of the potential security concern. It will take an extended period of time for the majority of hotels to be upgraded.

### How can I tell if a lock has been updated?

It is not possible to visually tell if a lock has been updated to fix these vulnerabilities. You may be able to tell if a hotel has been through the upgrade process if the guest keycards are using MIFARE Ultralight C cards instead of MIFARE Classic.

The NFC Taginfo app by NXP is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596) and can be used to identify the type of keycard.

Note that this information only applies to dormakaba Saflok systems; several other lock manufacturers use MIFARE Classic keycards and are not affected by the Unsaflok vulnerability. Nevertheless, the use of MIFARE Classic in a security sensitive application is not recommended.

### Will the deadbolt protect against a forged keycard?

**No.** Saflok locks can retract the deadbolt from software, and the deadbolt can be overridden by a malicious keycard. In order to deter entry into a room, another physical locking device must be used, such as a chain lock found in many hotels.

### What does an attacker need to perform this attack?

An attacker only needs to read one keycard from the property to perform the attack against any door in the property. This keycard can be from their own room, or even an expired keycard taken from the express checkout collection box.

Forged keycards can then be created using any MIFARE Classic card, and any commercially available tool capable of writing data to these cards. One pair of forged keycards allows an attacker to open any door in the property.

### Can the attack be carried out using a Flipper Zero or other tools?

Yes, this attack can also be performed using any device that is capable of reading and writing or emulating MIFARE Classic cards. This includes tools like the Proxmark3 and Flipper Zero, but also **an NFC capable Android phone**.

### Is it possible to detect an occurence of this attack?

It may be possible to detect certain attacks by auditing the lock’s entry/exit logs. Hotel staff can audit this via the HH6 device and look for suspicious entry/exit records. Due to the vulnerability, entry/exit records could be attributed to the wrong keycard or staff member.

### Has this vulnerability been exploited?

Dormakaba started selling Saflok locks in 1988, which means that vulnerable locks have been in use for over 36 years.

While we are not aware of any real world attacks that use these vulnerabilities, it is not impossible that these vulnerabilities are known, and have been used, by others.

### How does Unsaflok relate to the Saflok KDF that was published recently?

Dormakaba uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to derive the keys for some of the Saflok MIFARE Classic sectors. This proprietary KDF only uses the card’s Unique IDentifier (UID) as an input.

Knowledge of the KDF allows an attacker to easily read and clone a Saflok MIFARE Classic card. However, the KDF by itself is not sufficient for an attacker to create arbitrary Saflok keycards.

We are aware that this KDF has been reverse engineered by several people over the years, and that it was published recently after we had disclosed our findings to dormakaba.

### Are you sharing more technical information or proof of concepts?

We are not planning on sharing a full proof of concept at this time due to the potential impact to hotels and guests. We plan on sharing additional technical details of the vulnerability in the future.

### What was the disclosure timeline?

* **08/2022:** Our research began on Saflok locks
* **09/2022:** We completed a proof of concept exploit and contacted dormakaba
* **10/2022:** We had our first meeting with dormakaba about the issues
* **2022 - 2024**: During this time we had at least 13 meetings with dormakaba
* **11/2023:** First hotels upgraded to resolve vulnerability
* **03/2024:** Coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability’s high-level details

### How can I contact you?

The readers we develop support a variety of ID standards, from unencrypted EM-Marin and a long time ago cracked Mifare Classic to modern Desfire EVx standards. According to our statistics, more than 95% of customers still continue to use the most insecure identifiers because of their low cost and ease of operation. Many of the installed devices are not properly maintained, even if the manufacturers continue to support them, because you have to pay for maintenance. In addition, not all equipment can be updated remotely over the network or even have a network connection to do so remotely. Even if your cards are encrypted, it still can't guarantee you protection, because in most cases card readers are connected to controllers (not in the case of all-in-one devices like this lock) via Wiegand protocol, which doesn't provide any data encryption, so the identifier ID is transmitted over two wires in the clear form. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [lol768](user?id=lol768) [9 months ago](item?id=39782942)   | [parent](#39781759) | [next](#39785666) [–]  At some point, isn't there some responsibility that rests with manufacturers for choosing to continue to support known-insecure standards?

There should be. Also there should be liability for access control system customers for choosing low cost, insecure solutions.

These companies just issue a press release saying “we take security very seriously” and continue on with their business. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Nextgrid](user?id=Nextgrid) [9 months ago](item?id=39783014)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39782942) | [prev](#39786188) | [next](#39783932) [–]  It's often a compatibility thing too. Insecure standards can often coexist because they're the lowest common denominator. It's just a "password" stored and transmitted as plaintext. A secure system would involve a PKI which increases complexity and management overhead significantly (you won't be able to just copy "passwords" from one system to another, etc). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sonicanatidae](user?id=sonicanatidae) [9 months ago](item?id=39792638)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39783014) | [next](#39783932) [–]  Compat is a factor and valid in some instances.

Essentially every time I've stayed in a hotel with contactless keycards (usually in a group needing 3-5 rooms for 2-3 nights) at least one person has needed to get a keycard reissued. What's up with that? My workplace's smartcards and my contactless bank cards keep working for years on end. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lxgr](user?id=lxgr) [9 months ago](item?id=39784145)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784009) | [next](#39785563) [–]  Hotel keycards usually work by having dynamic data written to them at the front desk (as the locks are often not network connected, at least in older systems, so they write things to the card like "works for room 123 until March 30th noon and the gym" or "works for room 456; sequence number 2, invalidate all prior keys"). There are two types of magnetic stripe cards available: High-coercivity (HiCo) and low-coercivity (LoCo). The field-rewritable kind used in hotels is usually LoCo, to make the writers smaller and cheaper. But that also makes the cards much more prone to accidental corruption by magnets you might have on you, like earbuds, magnetic wallets etc. Bank cards are usually only ever programmed once (these days), i.e. when they're issued, so they're usually HiCo, making them much more robust against that. In addition to that, magnetic stripe usage has been phased out for payment cards in most countries and is getting rare even in the US, so for all you know, and depending on where you live/shop, your magnetic stripes might have already been demagnetized without any adverse effects! Bonus trivia question: Guess which kind NYC MTA Metrocards are :) Edit: Oh, I just saw that you asked about contactless keycards! For these I actually have no idea, and I haven't had one fail on me yet. I just know that they often use a similar scheme ("works for rooms x, y, z, until timestamp n"), sometimes with a bit of cryptography on top (often with a single shared key across all instances of the same lock and even across hotels...) but using non-networked locks, so there can definitely be synchronization/propagation issues too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [neuralRiot](user?id=neuralRiot) [9 months ago](item?id=39784398)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784145) | [next](#39785265) [–]  I used to work as maintenance on a big chain hotel and we had magstripe card locks, I don’t think strong security is their primary goal as in a hotel the staff can enter any room at any time, the cards me and my team had were “god mode” we could open any door at any time even when locked from inside. If the lock didn’t work “firmware problems, dead batteries, stuck mechanism” we had another device that worked by removing a cover and connecting with a wire, this was also used for testing and FW updates. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [baldeagle](user?id=baldeagle) [9 months ago](item?id=39786312)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784398) | [next](#39785537) [–]  When I worked mainteince on a big chain hotel in a major college town, we had a mark 2.0 crowbar if the key card didn't work. The real fun one was the flippy locks that you could kinda pop by slapping the non-working key card in, and slamming the door. The card would flex and spring the lock back. Then you could use the crowbar again. It wasn't too slow, but it was very loud. They told me couldn't whistle and spin the crowbar nonchalantly before casually popping open doors that had a dead battery in front of the guest waiting to stay in that same hotel. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jasonladuke0311](user?id=jasonladuke0311) [9 months ago](item?id=39793359)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786312) | [next](#39788661) [–]  That reminds me of the old “bump key” vuln in physical locks with tumblers | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thaumasiotes](user?id=thaumasiotes) [9 months ago](item?id=39788661)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786312) | [prev](#39793359) | [next](#39785537) [–]  > we had a mark 2.0 crowbar What were the improvements over "crowbar classic"? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lotsofpulp](user?id=lotsofpulp) [9 months ago](item?id=39785537)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784398) | [prev](#39786312) | [next](#39785265) [–]  > the cards me and my team had were “god mode” we could open any door at any time even when locked from inside. That is just bad management. The whole point of the interior deadbolt lock in a hotel room door is so no one can accidentally walk in on you thinking it is an empty room. An emergency keycard that can open a hotel room locked from the inside is only supposed to be kept at the front desk for use during an emergency, mostly by police or firefighters so they do not break down the door and cause tens of thousands of dollars of damage. And its presence and use should be constantly accounted for. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pledess](user?id=pledess) [9 months ago](item?id=39787651)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39785537) | [next](#39786674) [–]  Many U.S. hotels changed that after the Mandalay Bay hotel incident in October 2017. A guest can no longer assume that their deadbolted hotel room door will only be opened in an emergency. Routinely, hotel staff (not accompanied by police) may knock and then immediately open a guest's door for what they consider a "welfare check" (e.g., guest has had a Do Not Disturb sign for 2 days). And, yes, guests may be strongly opposed to this for a variety of reasons (in the room but undressed, etc.) but it often is part of a hotel's normal operating practices.

Rooms are checked regularly, but there should be quite a bit of knocking, and in the event it is deadbolted and the hotel guest refuses to open the door, or arrange a time the room can be inspected, then hotel management should be convened. Only after initial contact has been made and the hotel guest unreasonably refuses to allow access for an unreasonable period of time should hotel management "barge" in, or call the police. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lotsofpulp](user?id=lotsofpulp) [9 months ago](item?id=39790156)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39787651) | [prev](#39788333) | [next](#39786674) [–]  Yes, a hotel room should be checked regularly, at a minimum of once per week if not more frequently. And that should have always been the case due to pest control, not due to possibility of a crazy shooter. In any case, I would classify a guest refusing to open the door for a room check as outline in the rental agreement as an emergency (which should simply state once every x days or per management’s discretion). It could be up to hotel management to go in without police, but I would certainly not give any line level employee an emergency key card to carry around at all times for that scenario. And I would also expect a manager to take on that task themselves. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [throwaway2037](user?id=throwaway2037) [9 months ago](item?id=39786674)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39785537) | [prev](#39787651) | [next](#39785265) [–]   ```   > cause tens of thousands of dollars of damage  ``` This is surely overstated.

The cops or firefighters are not going to spend time cutting, they are going to bust it open with a battering ram which will ruin everything, requiring reframing, new door, new thresholds, new frames, new locks ($2k), and maybe flooring too. And then add in opportunity cost from not being able to rent the room during repair, which would take weeks due to those materials not being available at Home Depot. I would budget at least $10k, and I bet it would not exceed $20k, but either way, using a battering ram on a hotel door is very costly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jki275](user?id=jki275) [9 months ago](item?id=39807813)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786674) | [prev](#39787086) | [next](#39786923) [–]  I can guarantee you avoiding damage to the door is nowhere near any list of things any firefighter gives a flying fuck about. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rubidium](user?id=rubidium) [9 months ago](item?id=39786923)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786674) | [prev](#39807813) | [next](#39785265) [–]  Um, no they’re trained to get in as fast as possible.

It was programmed incorrectly and expired before it should have. The stay was extended but the key was not updated with the new departure date. A new key was erroneously issued for the room, someone used the new key to go into the room, saw someone was already staying in the room, and had to get keys for a different room.

It does not imply any particular standard. NFC *can be* a type of RFID system. Even saying NFC isn't necessarily implying any particular system of protection, basic NFC has no real protection out of the box and would require the higher-level protocols to actually provide any kind of encryption or relay protection or the like. An NFC-based system of RFID can also be incredibly insecure. Saying "RFID is insecure, use NFC" is like saying "radio is insecure, use WiFi." NFC is a subset of the concept of RFID, much the same way WiFi is a subset of digital radio protocols. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [datameta](user?id=datameta) [9 months ago](item?id=39785379)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39784453) | [next](#39783035) [–]  In my opinion it's clear that NFC is indeed designed with a higher focus on security than general RFID applications. In fact it emphasizes secure data exchange by design. Yes it is a subset of RFID technology operating at 13.56 MHz. Because NFC enables encrypted communication over very short distances (typically less than 4 cm), it is more challenging for unauthorized interception to happen. Also NFC supports two-way communication, which allows for more dynamic and secure interactions between devices, such as payment systems or secure access controls. RFID, while versatile and utilized across a range of applications from inventory management to access control, does not inherently prioritize security to the same extent. Its broader application spectrum means that specific security measures can vary significantly based on the use case and the design of the RFID system. For example, passive RFID tags, which are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity, can be read from distances up to several meters, potentially exposing them to unauthorized scans. Active RFID tags offer longer read ranges and can incorporate additional security features, but their cost and complexity limit their use to specific applications. Therefore, when comparing the security aspects directly, NFC's design principles inherently prioritize secure exchanges, leveraging close proximity communication and encryption standards that are well-suited for transactions and sensitive data exchanges. This focus on security, combined with the technology's adaptability for consumer use (e.g., smartphones for payments), underscores NFC's advantage in scenarios where security is paramount. Most hotels use non-NFC RFID and on top of that most use passive tags. So it is certainly an inherent security flaw of hotel door locks. Unfortunately non-meatspace security is also drastically in need of choosing more effective already existing measures. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vel0city](user?id=vel0city) [9 months ago](item?id=39786335)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39785379) | [next](#39783035) [–]  You keep suggesting NFC has a lot of security concepts baked in, but it's not really true. The base standards of NFC provide no encryption concepts. It provides no protection against sniffing. It provides no authentication. It provides no relay protection. The only "security" you get is it's designed for near communication, but you can absolutely read and write NFC tags from a distance with the right hardware. Base NFC has almost no security and relies on protocols on top to be secure. For example, Amibos use NFC and are trivially duplicated with cheap writable NFC tags. Contactless credit cards aren't secure because they do NFC, they're secure because NFC allows for an EMV transaction, it's the EMV handshake that handles all the security. Once again, suggesting NFC just has a lot of security by default is acting like WiFi is always secure. But even worse, because at least WiFi standards have encryption and what not built in and optional, NFC doesn't even provide that. And then you point out passive tags as if that's a thing that makes RFID less secure (ignoring NFC used for identification *is RFID*) but then I guess don't realize NFC allows for passive tags as well. I don't need to change batteries on my Amibos or the NFC stickers I put on the Wi-Fi info around the house. You could build a key card system with NFC that has the same or worse system as older key card platforms. It being NFC gives you absolutely no additional benefit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [datameta](user?id=datameta) [9 months ago](item?id=39791664)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39786335) | [next](#39783035) [–]  I think both our views are valid within their contexts, with the key difference being the distinction between NFC's base capabilities and the security measures actually implemented in NFC applications (where often upper layer protocols like in credit cards, are doing the heavy lifting for security). Since this discussion centers around real world incidence, you're right to point out that NFC does not inherently mean the application will be secure. I actually will also correct myself about saying that NFC is shorter range than RFID. Both HF and LF have about the same range. UHF has a range on the order of 10m but is almost never if at all used for high volume applications like hotel door locks. I do however disagree with your rejection of the colloquial usage of RFID to exclude NFC. In everyday conversation, I believe it is understood that NFC is a subset. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vel0city](user?id=vel0city) [9 months ago](item?id=39791757)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39791664) | [next](#39783035) [–]  The main point I'm trying to make is essentially targeted at this line of logic: > NFC's design principles inherently prioritize secure exchanges NFC's design principles inherently has *absolutely zero security*. It doesn't prioritize secure exchanges, at all. The fact secure exchanges *can* happen over NFC in incidental to NFC existing. Any secure exchange that happens over NFC happens because the higher-level application brought its own security. It's like UDP. Sure, you can do a secure exchange of data using it like QUIC or encrypted RTP, but UDP doesn't give you anything other than a way to send that data along. Which then compared to just an overall massively wide topic like "RFID", which encompasses dozens (hundreds?) of other technologies, some of which *do* actually prioritize secure (or at least attempted to secure) handshakes throughout the entire stack. And range of an RF thing is largely just based around typical hardware. If you wanted to you could build an antenna array to pick up an NFC tag from dozens of meters away. WiFi might only be designed to work around the house, but with a clear line of sight, decent RF conditions, and the right antennas you can send it miles. Generally speaking, you shouldn't *expect* any kind of security doing things with NFC. Because, NFC has no security inherent to the protocol. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Nextgrid](user?id=Nextgrid) [9 months ago](item?id=39783035)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39781892) | [prev](#39784453) | [next](#39785172) [–]  RFID is just a bidirectional link between the reader and the card.

Banning things doesn't make them impossible to get hold of but it does make it harder/more costly, which is all that any anti-crime measure can hope to achieve. Why do you say the opposite effect? This isn't like alcohol (or even, to an extent, weed) where a majority of ordinary decent people use it occasionally and want it to be available. Most people have never owned or used lockpicks and don't see any reason to have them if you're not a criminal.

In the United States, postal services have access to clusters of mailboxes and some common areas where mailman can leave mail and parcels, which can be entryways or some kind of storage rooms in them, for example, so that the owners can pick them up when they get home. These rooms are locked with padlocks made by several local companies. Once a key is inserted and turned in the lock, it can only be retrieved by turning it in the opposite direction to the default position, but even then they manage to forget them in the locks. A customer from the USA came to us and asked us to combine this padlock with an intercom system we are developing to signal the administrator that the letter carrier came, opened/closed the lock or forgot the key in it. Nobody wants to switch to RFID, of course, or else the employees of the lock manufacturing company will have nothing to eat, so we had to enlarge the intercom vertically in order to build into it a lock whose transom will close a group of contacts on the panel, letting us know that something is going on. On the edge, lmao. <https://imgur.com/a/63GoaTB> In the UK, mailmen are treated very differently - the intercoms have a special button on the intercom which, when pressed, will open the door so that the mailman can enter and drop off the mail without having to carry keys or RFID identifiers. Normally this button is set for some working hours, for example from 9 to 5 and of course anyone can press it and get into the premises. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [r3trohack3r](user?id=r3trohack3r) [9 months ago](item?id=39786717)   | [prev](#39781491) | [next](#39784159) [–]  I travel with a door jammer.

I've found it frustrating trying to fit in 80chars, and e.g., finding that ampersand gets expanded so it actually counts more than "and", so it is not a single-rule 80 chars; perhaps a few more sophisticated rules might help.

# Hackers Found a Way to Open Any of 3 Million Hotel Keycard Locks in Seconds

The company behind the Saflok-brand door locks is offering a fix, but it may take months or years to reach some hotels.Play/Pause ButtonPausePHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: WIRED STAFF; GETTY IMAGESSave this storySaveSave this storySave

When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back [Black Hat](https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/) and [Defcon](https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/) hacker conferences, it's a given that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself, the city's elaborate array of [casino](https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/) and [hospitality](https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/) technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually *invited* to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.

One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.

Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call [Unsaflok](https://unsaflok.com/). The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.

By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.

“Two quick taps and we open the door,” says Wouters, a researcher in the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group at the KU Leuven University in Belgium. “And that works on every door in the hotel.”

Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique with Dormakaba in November 2022. Dormakaba says that it's been working since early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming of each lock, door by door.

Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.

“We have worked closely with our partners to identify and implement an immediate mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously, and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter in a responsible way.”

The technique to hack Dormakaba's locks that Wouters and Carroll's research group discovered involves two distinct kinds of vulnerabilities: One that allows them to write to its keycards, and one that allows them to know *what* data to write to the cards to successfully trick a Saflok lock into opening. When they analyzed Saflok keycards, they saw that they use the MIFARE Classic RFID system, which has been known for more than a decade to have vulnerabilities that allow hackers to write to keycards, though the brute-force process can take as long as 20 seconds. They then cracked a part of Dormakaba's own encryption system, its so-called key derivation function, which allowed them to write to its cards far faster. With either of those tricks, the researchers could then copy a Saflok keycard at will, but still not generate one for a different room.

The researchers' more crucial step required them to obtain one of the lock programming devices that Dormakaba distributes to hotels, as well as a copy of its front desk software for managing keycards. By reverse engineering that software, they were able to understand all the data stored on the cards, pulling out a hotel property code as well as a code for each individual room, then create their own values and encrypt them just as Dormakaba's system would, allowing them to spoof a working master key that opens any room on the property. “You can make a card that really looks as if it was created by the software from Dormakaba, essentially,” says Wouters.

And how did Carroll and Wouters obtain Dormakaba's front desk software? “We nicely asked a few people,” Wouters says. “Manufacturers assume that no one will sell their equipment on eBay, and that no one will make a copy of their software, and those assumptions, I think everyone knows, are not really valid.”

Once they'd managed all that reverse engineering work, the final version of their attack could be pulled off with little more than a $300 Proxmark RFID read-write device and a couple of blank RFID cards, an Android phone, or a [Flipper Zero radio hacking tool](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/).

The biggest caveat to the hackers' Unsaflok technique is that it still requires that they have a keycard—even an expired one—for a room somewhere in the same hotel as the room they're targeting. That's because each card has a property-specific code they need to read and then duplicate on their spoofed card, as well as a room-specific one.

Once they have that property code, the technique also requires using an RFID read-write device to write two cards—one card that reprograms a target lock as well as the second spoofed card that unlocks it. (An Android phone or a Flipper Zero could also be used to emit one signal after another instead of the two cards, the researchers say.) The researchers hint that the first card allows them to open a target room without guessing its unique identifier in the hotel's system, but declined to say exactly what that first card does. They're holding that element of the technique in confidence to avoid giving too clear a set of instructions to would-be intruders or thieves.

By contrast, one security researcher presented a similar hotel keycard hack that [opened locks sold by the firm Onity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/23/hacker-will-expose-potential-security-flaw-in-more-than-four-million-hotel-room-keycard-locks/?sh=78d51b9eeb85) at the Black Hat conference in 2012 with no such obfuscation, and allowed any hacker to build a device that opened any of Onity's 10 million locks worldwide. When Onity refused to pay for the hardware upgrades necessary to solve the problem and instead put the onus on its customers, the issue remained unfixed in many hotels—and eventually was exploited in at least [one hacker's cross-country burglary spree](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/the-hotel-hacker/).

Carroll and Wouters say that they're trying to avoid that scenario by taking a more cautious approach, while still warning the public about their technique, given that hundreds of properties will likely remain vulnerable to it even now that Dormakaba has offered its fix. “We're trying to find the middle ground of helping Dormakaba to fix it quickly, but also telling the guests about it," says Carroll. “If someone else reverse engineers this today and starts exploiting it before people are aware, that might be an even bigger problem.”

To that end, Carroll and Wouters point out that hotel guests can recognize the vulnerable locks most often—but not always—by their distinct design: a round RFID reader with a wavy line cutting through it. They suggest that if hotel guests do have a Saflok on their door, they can determine if it's been updated by checking their keycard with the NFC Taginfo app by NXP, available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&hl=en_US&gl=US). If the lock is manufactured by Dormakaba, and that app shows that the keycard is still a MIFARE Classic card, it's likely still vulnerable.

If that's the case, the two researchers say, there's not much to do other than avoid leaving valuables in the room and, when you're inside, bolt the chain on the door. They warn that the deadbolt on the room is also controlled by the keycard lock, so it doesn't provide an extra safeguard. “If someone locks the deadbolt, they’re still not protected,” says Carroll.

Even without a perfect or fully implemented fix, Wouters and Carroll argue, it's better for hotel guests to know the risks than to have a false sense of security. After all, they point out, the Saflok brand has been sold for more than three decades, and may have been vulnerable for much or all of those years. Though Dormakaba says it's not aware of any past use of Wouters and Carroll's technique, the researchers point out that doesn't mean it never happened in secret.

“We think the vulnerability has been there for a long time,” says Wouters. “It's unlikely that we are the first to find this.”
