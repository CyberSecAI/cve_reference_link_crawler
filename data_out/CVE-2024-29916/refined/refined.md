Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of weaknesses in dormakaba's Saflok electronic RFID lock system. These include:

1.  **Weak Encryption:** The system utilizes the MIFARE Classic RFID system, which has known vulnerabilities. Additionally, dormakaba's proprietary key derivation function (KDF) is weak and only uses the card's Unique Identifier (UID) as input.
2.  **Lack of Authentication:** The system relies on easily cloned MIFARE Classic cards with a weak KDF allowing attackers to easily clone and create arbitrary Saflok keycards.
3.  **Offline Lock Management**: The locks are primarily offline, with access control managed through data written to the keycards at the front desk. This information includes property codes, room codes, and validity periods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **MIFARE Classic Vulnerabilities**: The use of MIFARE Classic, a known insecure RFID standard, allows attackers to read and clone keycards.
*   **Weak Key Derivation Function (KDF)**: Dormakaba's proprietary KDF, using only the card's UID, is easily reverse-engineered and allows key cloning.
*   **Lack of Cryptographic Security:** The system is vulnerable to replay attacks, as the door lock system does not sufficiently validate the authenticity of keycards.
*   **Offline Management Flaws:** The reliance on offline locks and card-based access control creates opportunities for exploitation by manipulating card data.
*   **Vulnerable Deadbolt:** The deadbolt is also controlled electronically by the keycard system and can be overridden by a malicious keycard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can create a forged keycard pair that opens any door in a hotel or property using the vulnerable Saflok system.
*   **Compromised Security:** The deadbolt is also vulnerable, so even locking it provides no added security.
*   **Widespread Impact:** Over 3 million locks in 131 countries are affected.
*   **Potential for Theft:** This vulnerability allows malicious actors to easily gain access to hotel rooms, potentially leading to theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cloning a Keycard:** By reading and cloning an existing keycard, which can be obtained from an active or expired guest key, an attacker can obtain the necessary data.
*   **Forging Keycards:** By reverse-engineering the lock system and its keycard encoding, attackers can create keycards that can open any door within a property.
*   **Exploiting Hardware and Software:** Attackers use commercially available tools like Proxmark3, Flipper Zero, or NFC-capable Android phones to read and write card data. They also use readily available or purchased hotel front desk software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Valid Keycard:** An attacker needs to acquire any valid or expired keycard from the target property. This can be done by being a guest, finding an old keycard or obtaining one from the express checkout.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of RFID technology, reverse engineering, and the ability to use RFID read/write tools.
*   **Access to Hardware:** Attackers need commercially available RFID reading/writing tools such as Proxmark3, Flipper Zero or NFC-enabled Android phones.
*  **Access to Software:** Access to the hotel management software aids in reverse-engineering the keycard data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack involves using two forged cards: one to reprogram the lock, and another to open it.
*   The vulnerabilities have been present for a long time, since the system has been sold since 1988.
*   The fix involves software updates, keycard reissuance, and upgrades to front desk systems.
*  As of March 2024, only 36% of the locks had been updated or replaced.
