The readers we develop support a variety of ID standards, from unencrypted EM-Marin and a long time ago cracked Mifare Classic to modern Desfire EVx standards. According to our statistics, more than 95% of customers still continue to use the most insecure identifiers because of their low cost and ease of operation. Many of the installed devices are not properly maintained, even if the manufacturers continue to support them, because you have to pay for maintenance. In addition, not all equipment can be updated remotely over the network or even have a network connection to do so remotely. Even if your cards are encrypted, it still can't guarantee you protection, because in most cases card readers are connected to controllers (not in the case of all-in-one devices like this lock) via Wiegand protocol, which doesn't provide any data encryption, so the identifier ID is transmitted over two wires in the clear form. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [lol768](user?id=lol768) [9 months ago](item?id=39782942)   | [parent](#39781759) | [next](#39785666) [–]  At some point, isn't there some responsibility that rests with manufacturers for choosing to continue to support known-insecure standards?

There should be. Also there should be liability for access control system customers for choosing low cost, insecure solutions. But just like in the InfoSec world, there are simply no consequences to companies that cheap out and fail at security. These companies just issue a press release saying “we take security very seriously” and continue on with their business. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Nextgrid](user?id=Nextgrid) [9 months ago](item?id=39783014)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39782942) | [prev](#39786188) | [next](#39783932) [–]  It's often a compatibility thing too. Insecure standards can often coexist because they're the lowest common denominator. It's just a "password" stored and transmitted as plaintext. A secure system would involve a PKI which increases complexity and management overhead significantly (you won't be able to just copy "passwords" from one system to another, etc). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sonicanatidae](user?id=sonicanatidae) [9 months ago](item?id=39792638)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39783014) | [next](#39783932) [–]  Compat is a factor and valid in some instances. It's not valid at all in this case. The old systems are wholly insecure, and should not be offered at all.

Essentially every time I've stayed in a hotel with contactless keycards (usually in a group needing 3-5 rooms for 2-3 nights) at least one person has needed to get a keycard reissued. What's up with that? My workplace's smartcards and my contactless bank cards keep working for years on end. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lxgr](user?id=lxgr) [9 months ago](item?id=39784145)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784009) | [next](#39785563) [–]  Hotel keycards usually work by having dynamic data written to them at the front desk (as the locks are often not network connected, at least in older systems, so they write things to the card like "works for room 123 until March 30th noon and the gym" or "works for room 456; sequence number 2, invalidate all prior keys"). There are two types of magnetic stripe cards available: High-coercivity (HiCo) and low-coercivity (LoCo). The field-rewritable kind used in hotels is usually LoCo, to make the writers smaller and cheaper. But that also makes the cards much more prone to accidental corruption by magnets you might have on you, like earbuds, magnetic wallets etc. Bank cards are usually only ever programmed once (these days), i.e. when they're issued, so they're usually HiCo, making them much more robust against that. In addition to that, magnetic stripe usage has been phased out for payment cards in most countries and is getting rare even in the US, so for all you know, and depending on where you live/shop, your magnetic stripes might have already been demagnetized without any adverse effects! Bonus trivia question: Guess which kind NYC MTA Metrocards are :) Edit: Oh, I just saw that you asked about contactless keycards! For these I actually have no idea, and I haven't had one fail on me yet. I just know that they often use a similar scheme ("works for rooms x, y, z, until timestamp n"), sometimes with a bit of cryptography on top (often with a single shared key across all instances of the same lock and even across hotels...) but using non-networked locks, so there can definitely be synchronization/propagation issues too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [neuralRiot](user?id=neuralRiot) [9 months ago](item?id=39784398)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784145) | [next](#39785265) [–]  I used to work as maintenance on a big chain hotel and we had magstripe card locks, I don’t think strong security is their primary goal as in a hotel the staff can enter any room at any time, the cards me and my team had were “god mode” we could open any door at any time even when locked from inside. If the lock didn’t work “firmware problems, dead batteries, stuck mechanism” we had another device that worked by removing a cover and connecting with a wire, this was also used for testing and FW updates. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [baldeagle](user?id=baldeagle) [9 months ago](item?id=39786312)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784398) | [next](#39785537) [–]  When I worked mainteince on a big chain hotel in a major college town, we had a mark 2.0 crowbar if the key card didn't work. The real fun one was the flippy locks that you could kinda pop by slapping the non-working key card in, and slamming the door. The card would flex and spring the lock back. Then you could use the crowbar again. It wasn't too slow, but it was very loud. They told me couldn't whistle and spin the crowbar nonchalantly before casually popping open doors that had a dead battery in front of the guest waiting to stay in that same hotel. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jasonladuke0311](user?id=jasonladuke0311) [9 months ago](item?id=39793359)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786312) | [next](#39788661) [–]  That reminds me of the old “bump key” vuln in physical locks with tumblers | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thaumasiotes](user?id=thaumasiotes) [9 months ago](item?id=39788661)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786312) | [prev](#39793359) | [next](#39785537) [–]  > we had a mark 2.0 crowbar What were the improvements over "crowbar classic"? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lotsofpulp](user?id=lotsofpulp) [9 months ago](item?id=39785537)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39784398) | [prev](#39786312) | [next](#39785265) [–]  > the cards me and my team had were “god mode” we could open any door at any time even when locked from inside. That is just bad management. The whole point of the interior deadbolt lock in a hotel room door is so no one can accidentally walk in on you thinking it is an empty room. An emergency keycard that can open a hotel room locked from the inside is only supposed to be kept at the front desk for use during an emergency, mostly by police or firefighters so they do not break down the door and cause tens of thousands of dollars of damage. And its presence and use should be constantly accounted for. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pledess](user?id=pledess) [9 months ago](item?id=39787651)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39785537) | [next](#39786674) [–]  Many U.S. hotels changed that after the Mandalay Bay hotel incident in October 2017. A guest can no longer assume that their deadbolted hotel room door will only be opened in an emergency. Routinely, hotel staff (not accompanied by police) may knock and then immediately open a guest's door for what they consider a "welfare check" (e.g., guest has had a Do Not Disturb sign for 2 days). And, yes, guests may be strongly opposed to this for a variety of reasons (in the room but undressed, etc.) but it often is part of a hotel's normal operating practices.

Rooms are checked regularly, but there should be quite a bit of knocking, and in the event it is deadbolted and the hotel guest refuses to open the door, or arrange a time the room can be inspected, then hotel management should be convened. Only after initial contact has been made and the hotel guest unreasonably refuses to allow access for an unreasonable period of time should hotel management "barge" in, or call the police. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lotsofpulp](user?id=lotsofpulp) [9 months ago](item?id=39790156)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39787651) | [prev](#39788333) | [next](#39786674) [–]  Yes, a hotel room should be checked regularly, at a minimum of once per week if not more frequently. And that should have always been the case due to pest control, not due to possibility of a crazy shooter. In any case, I would classify a guest refusing to open the door for a room check as outline in the rental agreement as an emergency (which should simply state once every x days or per management’s discretion). It could be up to hotel management to go in without police, but I would certainly not give any line level employee an emergency key card to carry around at all times for that scenario. And I would also expect a manager to take on that task themselves. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [throwaway2037](user?id=throwaway2037) [9 months ago](item?id=39786674)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39785537) | [prev](#39787651) | [next](#39785265) [–]   ```   > cause tens of thousands of dollars of damage  ``` This is surely overstated.

The cops or firefighters are not going to spend time cutting, they are going to bust it open with a battering ram which will ruin everything, requiring reframing, new door, new thresholds, new frames, new locks ($2k), and maybe flooring too. And then add in opportunity cost from not being able to rent the room during repair, which would take weeks due to those materials not being available at Home Depot. I would budget at least $10k, and I bet it would not exceed $20k, but either way, using a battering ram on a hotel door is very costly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jki275](user?id=jki275) [9 months ago](item?id=39807813)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786674) | [prev](#39787086) | [next](#39786923) [–]  I can guarantee you avoiding damage to the door is nowhere near any list of things any firefighter gives a flying fuck about. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rubidium](user?id=rubidium) [9 months ago](item?id=39786923)   | [root](#39781759) | [parent](#39786674) | [prev](#39807813) | [next](#39785265) [–]  Um, no they’re trained to get in as fast as possible.

It took a journalist and a lot of e-mails and calls for my landlord to understand the problem, I suspect that Scantron were also downplaying the issue towards them. They finally budged and upgraded all the locks to use a better encryption scheme and re-issue keys. My building have 197 apartments, each of them have at least 2 keys, I have to trust all of the tenants (and their friends), in order for my apartment not to get burgled, and if I were burgled my insurance wouldn't cover because there's likely no proof of entry. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mdekkers](user?id=mdekkers) [9 months ago](item?id=39782252)   | [parent](#39781315) | [next](#39783848) [–]  I have rented my entire life, and “change all the locks” has always been the very first thing I do.

So I had to put the old cylinder back in, because of condo rules about the property management company needing keys. (Though I later learned that the property management company might not have been able to find my unit's key if they ever wanted to. One day, the fire department was at the building, trying to get into a different unit, which had an alarm sounding, but they found that the key box was empty. I was there, so I called the management company, but they refused to send a runner with the key.

I think landlords have to give you notice before entering your unit in most areas. Swapping locks is maybe a ten minute job (probably less if you've done it a lot).

It does not imply any particular standard. NFC *can be* a type of RFID system. Even saying NFC isn't necessarily implying any particular system of protection, basic NFC has no real protection out of the box and would require the higher-level protocols to actually provide any kind of encryption or relay protection or the like. An NFC-based system of RFID can also be incredibly insecure. Saying "RFID is insecure, use NFC" is like saying "radio is insecure, use WiFi." NFC is a subset of the concept of RFID, much the same way WiFi is a subset of digital radio protocols. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [datameta](user?id=datameta) [9 months ago](item?id=39785379)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39784453) | [next](#39783035) [–]  In my opinion it's clear that NFC is indeed designed with a higher focus on security than general RFID applications. In fact it emphasizes secure data exchange by design. Yes it is a subset of RFID technology operating at 13.56 MHz. Because NFC enables encrypted communication over very short distances (typically less than 4 cm), it is more challenging for unauthorized interception to happen. Also NFC supports two-way communication, which allows for more dynamic and secure interactions between devices, such as payment systems or secure access controls. RFID, while versatile and utilized across a range of applications from inventory management to access control, does not inherently prioritize security to the same extent. Its broader application spectrum means that specific security measures can vary significantly based on the use case and the design of the RFID system. For example, passive RFID tags, which are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness and simplicity, can be read from distances up to several meters, potentially exposing them to unauthorized scans. Active RFID tags offer longer read ranges and can incorporate additional security features, but their cost and complexity limit their use to specific applications. Therefore, when comparing the security aspects directly, NFC's design principles inherently prioritize secure exchanges, leveraging close proximity communication and encryption standards that are well-suited for transactions and sensitive data exchanges. This focus on security, combined with the technology's adaptability for consumer use (e.g., smartphones for payments), underscores NFC's advantage in scenarios where security is paramount. Most hotels use non-NFC RFID and on top of that most use passive tags. So it is certainly an inherent security flaw of hotel door locks. Unfortunately non-meatspace security is also drastically in need of choosing more effective already existing measures. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vel0city](user?id=vel0city) [9 months ago](item?id=39786335)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39785379) | [next](#39783035) [–]  You keep suggesting NFC has a lot of security concepts baked in, but it's not really true. The base standards of NFC provide no encryption concepts. It provides no protection against sniffing. It provides no authentication. It provides no relay protection. The only "security" you get is it's designed for near communication, but you can absolutely read and write NFC tags from a distance with the right hardware. Base NFC has almost no security and relies on protocols on top to be secure. For example, Amibos use NFC and are trivially duplicated with cheap writable NFC tags. Contactless credit cards aren't secure because they do NFC, they're secure because NFC allows for an EMV transaction, it's the EMV handshake that handles all the security. Once again, suggesting NFC just has a lot of security by default is acting like WiFi is always secure. But even worse, because at least WiFi standards have encryption and what not built in and optional, NFC doesn't even provide that. And then you point out passive tags as if that's a thing that makes RFID less secure (ignoring NFC used for identification *is RFID*) but then I guess don't realize NFC allows for passive tags as well. I don't need to change batteries on my Amibos or the NFC stickers I put on the Wi-Fi info around the house. You could build a key card system with NFC that has the same or worse system as older key card platforms. It being NFC gives you absolutely no additional benefit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [datameta](user?id=datameta) [9 months ago](item?id=39791664)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39786335) | [next](#39783035) [–]  I think both our views are valid within their contexts, with the key difference being the distinction between NFC's base capabilities and the security measures actually implemented in NFC applications (where often upper layer protocols like in credit cards, are doing the heavy lifting for security). Since this discussion centers around real world incidence, you're right to point out that NFC does not inherently mean the application will be secure. I actually will also correct myself about saying that NFC is shorter range than RFID. Both HF and LF have about the same range. UHF has a range on the order of 10m but is almost never if at all used for high volume applications like hotel door locks. I do however disagree with your rejection of the colloquial usage of RFID to exclude NFC. In everyday conversation, I believe it is understood that NFC is a subset. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vel0city](user?id=vel0city) [9 months ago](item?id=39791757)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39791664) | [next](#39783035) [–]  The main point I'm trying to make is essentially targeted at this line of logic: > NFC's design principles inherently prioritize secure exchanges NFC's design principles inherently has *absolutely zero security*. It doesn't prioritize secure exchanges, at all. The fact secure exchanges *can* happen over NFC in incidental to NFC existing. Any secure exchange that happens over NFC happens because the higher-level application brought its own security. It's like UDP. Sure, you can do a secure exchange of data using it like QUIC or encrypted RTP, but UDP doesn't give you anything other than a way to send that data along. Which then compared to just an overall massively wide topic like "RFID", which encompasses dozens (hundreds?) of other technologies, some of which *do* actually prioritize secure (or at least attempted to secure) handshakes throughout the entire stack. And range of an RF thing is largely just based around typical hardware. If you wanted to you could build an antenna array to pick up an NFC tag from dozens of meters away. WiFi might only be designed to work around the house, but with a clear line of sight, decent RF conditions, and the right antennas you can send it miles. Generally speaking, you shouldn't *expect* any kind of security doing things with NFC. Because, NFC has no security inherent to the protocol. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Nextgrid](user?id=Nextgrid) [9 months ago](item?id=39783035)   | [root](#39781491) | [parent](#39781892) | [prev](#39784453) | [next](#39785172) [–]  RFID is just a bidirectional link between the reader and the card.

In the United States, postal services have access to clusters of mailboxes and some common areas where mailman can leave mail and parcels, which can be entryways or some kind of storage rooms in them, for example, so that the owners can pick them up when they get home. These rooms are locked with padlocks made by several local companies. Once a key is inserted and turned in the lock, it can only be retrieved by turning it in the opposite direction to the default position, but even then they manage to forget them in the locks. A customer from the USA came to us and asked us to combine this padlock with an intercom system we are developing to signal the administrator that the letter carrier came, opened/closed the lock or forgot the key in it. Nobody wants to switch to RFID, of course, or else the employees of the lock manufacturing company will have nothing to eat, so we had to enlarge the intercom vertically in order to build into it a lock whose transom will close a group of contacts on the panel, letting us know that something is going on. On the edge, lmao. <https://imgur.com/a/63GoaTB> In the UK, mailmen are treated very differently - the intercoms have a special button on the intercom which, when pressed, will open the door so that the mailman can enter and drop off the mail without having to carry keys or RFID identifiers. Normally this button is set for some working hours, for example from 9 to 5 and of course anyone can press it and get into the premises. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [r3trohack3r](user?id=r3trohack3r) [9 months ago](item?id=39786717)   | [prev](#39781491) | [next](#39784159) [–]  I travel with a door jammer.

I was *definitely NOT* thinking of unlimited. I was thinking of 80chars, but excluding numerals (123, etc) and number text ("thousand", "million" etc.) and maybe a few other items excluded from the count, with a maximum of 100, or whatever number actually will not break the layout. I've found it frustrating trying to fit in 80chars, and e.g., finding that ampersand gets expanded so it actually counts more than "and", so it is not a single-rule 80 chars; perhaps a few more sophisticated rules might help. Just a suggestion. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aqfamnzc](user?id=aqfamnzc) [9 months ago](item?id=39782153)   | [root](#39779732) | [parent](#39781598) | [next](#39780992) [–]  Not that it really matters, but I found it interesting thinking of ways this could be broken... ```     million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [toss1](user?id=toss1) [9 months ago](item?id=39784047)   | [root](#39779732) | [parent](#39782153) | [next](#39780992) [–]  you missed the >>"with a maximum of 100," | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hulitu](user?id=hulitu) [9 months ago](item?id=39780992)   | [root](#39779732) | [parent](#39780068) | [prev](#39780194) | [next](#39780567) [–]  mm is milimeters.
