Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2023-48987:

**Root Cause:**
- A blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the 'pages.php' file within the CUSG CMS admin portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can gain full read/write access to the backend database.
- The attacker can leverage this access to obtain the "ultra admin" password.
- The "ultra admin" account grants access to every installation of the vulnerable CMS globally if multi-factor authentication is not enabled. This means an attacker can potentially compromise all organizations using the vulnerable CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed over the web via the CUSG CMS admin portal.
- The vulnerability is in the 'pages.php' file, likely through a parameter that is not sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the CUSG CMS admin portal.
- The attacker must be able to send web requests to the vulnerable 'pages.php' endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2023-48985 to form a complete “zero to ultra admin” kill chain, where an unauthenticated user can intercept admin login credentials then use the credentials to exploit the blind SQL injection.
- The "ultra admin" account is described as a vendor backdoor account.
- The vendor, CUSG, has released an update that addresses this vulnerability, indicating the vulnerability has been fixed in version v7.75 and later.
- It is recommended that organizations using this CMS enable multi-factor authentication, in addition to upgrading their software.
