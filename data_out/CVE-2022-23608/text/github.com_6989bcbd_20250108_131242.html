# Use after free of dialog set

High

[sauwming](/sauwming)

GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62
Feb 20, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.11.1 or below

## Patched versions

2.12 or later

## Description

In a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed. The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leads to endless loop.

### Impact

It is a use after free vulnerability and affects all PJSIP users.

### Patches

The patch is available as commit [db32359](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f) in the master branch.
