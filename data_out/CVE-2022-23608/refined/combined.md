    Buffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_call_dump. An
    attacker-controlled 'buffer' argument may cause a buffer overflow,
    since supplying an output buffer smaller than 128 characters may
    overflow the output buffer, regardless of the 'maxlen' argument
    supplied

CVE-2021-43804

    An incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this
    declared length is not checked against the actual received packet
    size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. A
    malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason
    length

CVE-2021-43845

    if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not
    checked against the received packet size, potentially resulting in
    an out-of-bound read access

CVE-2022-21722

    it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can
    potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects
    all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP.

CVE-2022-21723

    Parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed
    multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This
    issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart.

CVE-2022-23608

    When in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by
    multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one
    of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to
    be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different
    hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list
    collision which eventually leading to endless loop

CVE-2022-24754

    There is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts
    PJSIP users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with
    data_type `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`).

CVE-2022-24764

     A stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users
     or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(),
     pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.5~dfsg-6+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your pjproject packages.

* Update pjsip_ua_unregister_dlg():
- update the hash key if the dialog being unregistered is used as hash key.
- add an assertion check to make sure that the dlg_set to be removed is valid (can be found in the hash table).

* Change hash key string comparison method.

Debian Bug     : 1014998 1018073 1014976

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk, an Open Source
Private Branch Exchange. Buffer overflows and other programming errors could be
exploited for information disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code.

Special care should be taken when upgrading to this new upstream release.
Some configuration files and options have changed in order to remedy
certain security vulnerabilities. Most notably the pjsip TLS listener only
accepts TLSv1.3 connections in the default configuration now. This can be
reverted by adding method=tlsv1_2 to the transport in pjsip.conf. See also
<https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-29017>.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:16.28.0~dfsg-0+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

For the detailed security status of asterisk please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asterisk>

# Use after free of dialog set

High

[sauwming](/sauwming)
published
GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62
Feb 20, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.11.1 or below

## Patched versions

2.12 or later

## Description

In a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed. The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leads to endless loop.

### Impact

It is a use after free vulnerability and affects all PJSIP users.

### Patches

The patch is available as commit [db32359](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f) in the master branch.
