*\*Note: Product list table contents subject to change.*

*\*\*Note: Users of Autodesk Advance Steel, Autodesk Civil 3D, and the specialized toolsets of AutoCAD need to install the product update(s) listed above. These security fixes are not included in the updates specific to individual toolsets.*

### Recommendations

Autodesk strongly recommends that users of the listed supported versions of AutoCAD, Advance Steel, Civil 3D and the specialized toolsets of AutoCAD install the latest updates, as applicable, via [Autodesk Access](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-access/overview) or the [Accounts Portal](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-access/overview). As a general best practice, we also recommend that customers open files from trusted sources (CATPART, SLDASM, X\_B, 3DM[KA1], CATPROD, STP, MODEL, SLDDRW, SLDPRT, X\_T, IGES).

Customers using previous versions that no longer qualify for full support should plan to upgrade to a supported version as soon as possible to avoid downtime and potential security vulnerabilities. Visit the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/previous-version-support/bd-p/6051) for more information about previous version support.
