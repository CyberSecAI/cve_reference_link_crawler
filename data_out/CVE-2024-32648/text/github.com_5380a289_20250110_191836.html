| Version Information  * vyper Version (output of `vyper --version`): v0.2.16   nonreentrant keys are allowed on default functions, e.g.  ``` @external @payable @nonreentrant("default") def __default__():     pass ```  but it doesn't do anything, here's the output:  ```       [seq,         [if, [lt, calldatasize, 4], [goto, fallback]],         [mstore, 28, [calldataload, 0]],         [with, _func_sig, [mload, 0], seq],         [seq_unchecked,           [label, fallback],           [seq,             pass,             # Line 5             pass,             pass,             # Line 4             stop]]],   ``` |
