# default functions don't respect nonreentrancy keys

Low

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-m2v9-w374-5hj9
Apr 25, 2024

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.2.16

## Patched versions

0.3.0

## Description

### Summary

Prior to v0.3.0, `__default__()` functions did not respect the `@nonreentrancy` decorator and the lock was not emitted. This is a known bug and was already visible in the issue tracker ([#2455](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2455)), but it is being re-issued as an advisory so that tools relying on the advisory publication list can incorporate it into their searches.

A contract search was additionally performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production.

### PoC

```
@external
@payable
@nonreentrant("default")
def __default__():
    pass
```

after codegen:

```
[seq,
  [if, [lt, calldatasize, 4], [goto, fallback]],
  [mstore, 28, [calldataload, 0]],
  [with, _func_sig, [mload, 0], seq],
  [seq_unchecked,
    [label, fallback],
    [seq,
      pass,
      # Line 5
      pass,
      pass,
      # Line 4
      stop]]],

```
### Impact

No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, using a lock on a `default` function is a very sparsely used pattern. As such, the impact is `low`.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-32648

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
