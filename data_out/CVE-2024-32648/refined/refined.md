{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `@nonreentrant` decorator was not being respected on `__default__()` functions, causing the reentrancy lock to not be emitted during code generation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper enforcement of non-reentrancy"
    ],
    "impact": "The lack of non-reentrancy protection on `__default__` functions could potentially allow reentrancy attacks if a contract uses a lock on a default function.",
        "attack_vectors": "A malicious contract could exploit the lack of non-reentrancy protection by calling the vulnerable contract's default function recursively.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to call the vulnerable contract's default function and recursively exploit the reentrancy vulnerability."
