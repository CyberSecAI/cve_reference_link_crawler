{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption about the context in which `try_grab_folio()` is called on non-SMP kernels. Specifically, an optimization introduced by commit 57edfcfd3419 for pinning THP called `try_grab_folio()` which is intended to be used in atomic context for non-SMP kernels. This is due to commit e286781d5f2e introducing speculative page references.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the violation of the atomic context requirement in `folio_ref_try_add_rcu()` on non-SMP kernels. The code was not ensuring that interrupts were disabled or preemption was disabled when calling `try_grab_folio()`, leading to a race condition and a kernel bug.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash, specifically a kernel BUG, due to the failed assertion in `folio_ref_try_add_rcu()`. This can lead to a denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `process_vm_readv()` system call, which triggers the get user pages (GUP) mechanism. The GUP mechanism, in turn, calls `try_grab_folio()` which is exposed due to the optimization for pinning THP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to make the `process_vm_readv()` system call with an argument that would lead to a THP being pinned via the vulnerable code path.  This generally implies a local user with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code via system calls."
