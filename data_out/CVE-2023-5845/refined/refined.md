- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Social Buttons plugin leaks password-protected post content by including it in the `og:description` and `twitter:description` meta tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass, specifically a leakage of sensitive content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can access the content of password-protected posts by viewing the HTML source code of the page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a network-based attack. An attacker accesses the public website and views the page source.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be unauthenticated and have network access to the vulnerable website.
