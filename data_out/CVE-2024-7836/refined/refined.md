Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `duplicate_page_ajaxify` function within the Themify Builder plugin. This function handles AJAX requests to duplicate posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `duplicate_page_ajaxify` function lacks proper authorization checks to ensure only users with the necessary permissions can duplicate posts.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin uses `wp_ajax_tb_duplicate_page` action to handle AJAX requests for post duplication, but doesn't sufficiently validate user roles and capabilities, relying only on `current_user_can('edit_posts')` which is granted to Contributor-level users and above.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Post Access:** Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher can duplicate any post (including private or draft posts) regardless of who created them, gaining access to the content which they otherwise wouldn't be able to view.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view the content of private or draft posts by duplicating them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited via network requests by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_tb_duplicate_page` endpoint.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid WordPress account with at least Contributor-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with Contributor or higher role permissions.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `class-builder-duplicate-page.php` file within the Themify Builder plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.6.2 of the plugin.
- The provided source code from plugins.trac.wordpress.org confirms that the `duplicate_page_ajaxify` function at line 41 lacks specific checks for post ownership or access controls.
