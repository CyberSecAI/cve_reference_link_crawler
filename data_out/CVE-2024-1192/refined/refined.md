- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow occurs when processing user-provided input. Specifically, when a long string of 'A' characters (5005 bytes) is pasted into the username field, it leads to a denial of service.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (DoS)
- Attack vectors: Remote
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the WebDrive application and provide a long string of characters to the username field during the connection configuration.
