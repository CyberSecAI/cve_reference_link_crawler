Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-52169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the NTFS handler of 7-Zip when parsing a file name. Specifically, the code incorrectly calculates the length of the filename, leading to the reading of data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Filename Length Check:** The `CFileNameAttr::Parse` function uses the filename length in characters as a byte length, resulting in reading beyond the allocated memory for the filename string. The check should have multiplied the length by 2 to account for the UTF-16LE encoding.
- **Missing Boundary Check:** The code doesn't properly validate the filename length against the size of the allocated buffer, causing an over-read when extracting the filename string using `GetString`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By crafting a malformed NTFS file system image, an attacker can cause 7-Zip to read arbitrary data from memory beyond the allocated buffer. This data is then presented as part of the extracted filename, effectively leaking the content of that memory region.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** In a web service environment, this vulnerability can expose server-side data if the same 7-Zip instance is used to process archives from multiple users, potentially leaking secrets from one user's archive to another.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious NTFS file system image with a specially crafted `$FILE_NAME` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the malformed NTFS file system image to a vulnerable instance of 7-Zip.
- For the web service scenario, the attacker must be able to upload an archive containing the malicious file system image to the service.
- For a successful exploitation in the web-service use cases, the service must:
    - use 7-Zip as a library to process archives
    - run a single process to process archives from multiple (untrusted) sources
    - allow users to observe file names stored in their processed archives

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects versions of 7-Zip prior to 24.01 beta.
- The vulnerability is present in the "full" implementation of 7-Zip (7zz) and its library.
- The vulnerability does not affect implementations that do not use the NTFS parser (e.g., 7za and 7zr).
- The vulnerability was silently fixed in 7-Zip 24.01 beta without any advisory or change log entry
