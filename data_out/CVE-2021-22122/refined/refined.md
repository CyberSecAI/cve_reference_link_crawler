- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the FortiWeb GUI interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious payloads can be injected into vulnerable API endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands by injecting malicious scripts into the web page viewed by the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker injects malicious payloads into vulnerable API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoints, no authentication is needed. The user needs to click on the malicious link or otherwise trigger the request containing the attacker's payload.
