- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Arbitrary file download vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated, remote attacker can download arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have remote access to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ISE device.
