- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, leading to HTTP response splitting.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could enable malicious actors to compromise a victim's browser context/session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog in WorkstationST.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog to inject malicious CRLF sequences, although the document notes that WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments, raising attack complexity.
