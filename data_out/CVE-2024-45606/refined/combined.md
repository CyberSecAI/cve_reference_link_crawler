# Improper authorization on muting of alert rules

Moderate

[geoffg-sentry](/geoffg-sentry)
published
GHSA-v345-w9f2-mpm5
Sep 17, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=23.4.0, <=24.8.0

## Patched versions

24.9.0

## Description

### Impact

An authenticated user can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects given a known given rule ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project.

In our review, we have identified no instances where alerts have been muted by unauthorized parties.

### Patches

A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions are no longer able to mute alerts.

Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher.

### Affected Versions

The rule mute feature was generally available as of 23.6.0 but users with early access may have had the feature as of 23.4.0.

### Update

As of 2024-10-25 and after additional we've updated the Severity scoring to reduce Privileged Required from Low to None and Integrity from High to Low. Thanks again to [@emanuelbeni](https://github.com/emanuelbeni) for the correction on Privileges Required.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
