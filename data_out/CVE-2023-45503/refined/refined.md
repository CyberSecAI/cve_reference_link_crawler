Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2023-45503.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the insecure handling of user input within the Macrob7 Macs CMS. Specifically, the application lacks proper sanitization, validation, and parameterization when processing user-supplied data, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- Lack of input sanitization
- Lack of parameterization in SQL queries
- Reliance on string concatenation to construct SQL queries

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Private data leakage, including user password hashes.
- Modification of user credentials and privilege levels, leading to privilege escalation.
- Potential for remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-controlled parameters in HTTP requests. The spreadsheet details multiple endpoints and parameters susceptible to injection, including:
- `emailAddress` (in resetPassword and forgotPasswordProcess)
- `username` (in saveUser)
- `name` and `description` (in saveRole)
- `userId` (in deleteUser)
- `roleId` (in deleteRole)
- `commentId` (in deleteComment and allowComment)
- Additionally vulnerable parameters are listed when saving/updating users, roles, and comments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious SQL injection payloads in the user-controlled parameters. No special position is required, as the vulnerable parameters are part of the application's normal functionality (such as password reset, user creation, etc).
