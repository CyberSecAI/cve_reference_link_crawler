Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

CVE

Mitigation

CVE-2022-34756

Disable the device Web HMI by using the Easergy Pro to turn off the
HTTPS server in the communication menu.

If the device firmware version is prior to V01.401.101, limit the use
of Easergy Pro software to the front USB port. The option to disable
SSH on the rear Ethernet board is not yet available in this version of
the firmware.

CVE-2022-34757

If the device firmware is V01.401.101 to V01.402.001:

•  Disable the SSH on the rear Ethernet port and use

•

only Easergy Pro on the front USB port.
If you are using Easergy Pro software on the rear Ethernet
port, disable SSH on the rear Ethernet port when it is not in
use

CVE-2022-34758

Follow the General Security Recommendations below.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.

•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended for.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
