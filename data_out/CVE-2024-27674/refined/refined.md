- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure file permissions on the installation directory of Macro Expert allow unprivileged users to modify files, specifically `MacroService.exe`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Permissions. The `C:\Program Files (x86)\GrassSoft\Macro Expert` directory has write permissions for the `BUILTIN\Users` group. This allows any local user to modify the files in this directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local unprivileged attacker can achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by replacing the legitimate `MacroService.exe` with a malicious executable. The Macro Expert service, which runs as SYSTEM, will execute this malicious binary upon reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with write access to the Macro Expert installation directory. The attacker replaces the `MacroService.exe` file with their own malicious executable. The service will execute the malicious executable on reboot when the service starts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to modify files in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\GrassSoft\Macro Expert` directory.
