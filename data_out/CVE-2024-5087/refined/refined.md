The provided content relates to CVE-2024-5087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `validate_ajax`, `deactivate_ajax`, and `save_ajax` functions within the `wf-licensing.php` file of the Minimal Coming Soon â€“ Coming Soon Page plugin. This allows authenticated users, including those with subscriber-level access, to modify license settings through AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary privileges before executing license-related actions. Specifically, the `manage_options` capability, typically associated with administrators, is not checked before modifying license options.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **License manipulation:** Attackers with low-level access can modify the plugin's license key. This could lead to:
  - Disabling premium features by invalidating the license.
  - Potential disruption of the plugin's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via AJAX requests sent to the WordPress backend.
- The `validate_ajax`, `deactivate_ajax`, and `save_ajax` action hooks are the vulnerable entry points.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress website with at least 'Subscriber' level privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send AJAX requests to the WordPress backend.

The Wordfence article also notes that the issue has been fixed in version 2.39 of the plugin. The relevant code change involves adding a check for the `manage_options` capability within the vulnerable functions.
