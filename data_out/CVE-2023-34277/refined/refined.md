```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the SOAP API interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected D-Link DIR-2150 router.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the SOAP API interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The authentication mechanism can be bypassed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the device. Although authentication is required, it can be bypassed."
