- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OPENSSLDIR build definition was not explicitly provided during the DLL build process, causing the build system to default to the local directory on the build system. This insecure path was then encoded into the affected DLL file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure path reference within a DLL file. Specifically, the OPENSSLDIR build definition was not explicitly provided during the DLL build process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by creating a specific directory structure locally on the Splunk Enterprise instance and installing malicious code within it.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs local access to the Windows machine running Splunk Enterprise. The attacker can determine the insecure path referenced in the DLL file, create the corresponding directory structure, and then place malicious code within it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a low-privileged account on the Windows machine where Splunk Enterprise is installed, and the ability to create directories and place files within the file system. They also need to be able to determine the insecure path embedded within the DLL.
