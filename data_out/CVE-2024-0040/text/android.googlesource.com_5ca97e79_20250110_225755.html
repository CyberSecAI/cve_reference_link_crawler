Update mtp packet bufferCurrently, the buffer size is not changed when the packet size is increased. Ideally, the buffer size should be larger than the packet size. In our case, when the packet size is increased, we must reallocate the buffer of MTP packet.Bug: 300007708Test: build and flash the device.
