General Security Practices

General Security Measures

As general security measures, SICK recommends to minimize network exposure of the devices, restrict
network access and follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT
environment.

Vulnerability Classification

SICK performs vulnerability classification by using the CVSS scoring system (CVSS v3.1). The environ-
mental score is dependent on the customer’s environment and can affect the overall CVSS score. SICK
recommends that customers individually evaluate the environmental score to achieve final scoring.
