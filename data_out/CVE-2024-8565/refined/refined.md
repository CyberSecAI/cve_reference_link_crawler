Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/print_diseases.php` file of the SourceCodester Clinic's Patient Management System. Specifically, the `disease`, `from`, and `to` GET parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`disease`, `from`, and `to` GET parameters) within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Access:** An attacker can gain full access to the database. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive patient data, medical records, and other confidential information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of database records, leading to data corruption or loss.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining access to other parts of the system or server.
    *   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, SQL injection can be used to execute commands on the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/print_diseases.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code injected into the `disease`, `from`, or `to` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the web application server to send the malicious requests.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) uses `sqlmap`, a tool for automated SQL injection detection and exploitation, to demonstrate the vulnerability. The SQLmap payloads show that a time-based blind SQL injection is possible in all three parameters.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 2.0 of the SourceCodester Clinic's Patient Management System.
