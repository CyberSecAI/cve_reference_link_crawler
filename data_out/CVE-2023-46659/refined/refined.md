Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Edgewall Trac Plugin fails to properly sanitize the Trac website URL before displaying it on the build page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin does not escape the Trac website URL when rendering the build page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts into the Trac website URL. When a user views the build page, this script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies)
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the Jenkins UI

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious code into the Trac website URL within the plugin settings/configuration.
- The malicious payload is stored within Jenkins and triggered whenever a user views the build page associated with the configured job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission to the affected Jenkins job.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Edgewall Trac Plugin versions 1.13 and earlier.
- There is no fix available as of the publication of the advisory.
