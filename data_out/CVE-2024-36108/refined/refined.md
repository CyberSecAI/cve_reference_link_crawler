Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed authorization logic within the `casgate` application. Specifically, a predicate in the built-in matcher for the `api-model-built-in` model allows unauthenticated users to bypass authorization checks on certain API endpoints. This occurs because the predicate `(r.subOwner == r.objOwner && r.subName == r.objName)` is intended to grant access to a user to their own account. However, when a user isn't authenticated, the variables `subOwner` and `subName` are set to "anonymous". When accessing an object, `objOwner` and `objName` are populated from the `id` parameter of GET requests. In list operations, the `id` parameter is ignored, but can still be set by the attacker to "anonymous/anonymous" effectively bypassing the authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Function-Level Authorization (BOLA):** The core vulnerability is a BOLA, where the application fails to properly enforce authorization based on user roles/permissions when handling API requests.
- **Insecure Default Values:** The setting of `subOwner` and `subName` to "anonymous" for unauthenticated users, combined with the flawed authorization predicate, leads to the bypass.
- **Unrestricted Access:** The lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the `id` parameter of the API allows the attacker to manipulate it to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact varies based on the endpoint accessed:

- **Critical Endpoints:** Exploitation of endpoints like `/api/get-adapters`, `/api/get-certs`, `/api/get-globle-certs`, `/api/get-syncers`, and `/api/get-tokens` can lead to account takeover, privilege escalation, and exposure of credentials for other services.
- **High Impact Endpoints:** Accessing endpoints like `/api/get-ldap-users`, `/api/get-models`, `/api/get-user-payments`, `/api/get-users`, and `/api/get-webhooks` exposes sensitive or personal data.
- **Moderate Impact Endpoints:** Endpoints such as `/api/get-enforcers`, `/api/get-global-providers`, `/api/get-groups`, `/api/get-ldaps`, `/api/get-resources`, and `/api/get-roles` disclose internal data that could facilitate further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable API endpoints, with an `id` parameter set to `anonymous/anonymous`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any prior privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.8, which is considered critical.
- The issue was addressed in pull request #201.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) curl command is provided, demonstrating how to exploit the issue.
