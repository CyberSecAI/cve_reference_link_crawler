Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that when a user account is deleted, the system does not invalidate the existing user session. This allows deleted users, if they haven't logged out, to continue accessing platform resources as if their accounts were still active.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Session Management Issue:** The primary weakness is in the session management of the application. Deleting a user account should invalidate the associated user session to prevent further access.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access control policies after a user account is deleted, allowing a deleted user to bypass normal authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The most significant impact is potential information leakage. A deleted user who has not logged out can still view and access platform resources, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized individuals.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Deleted users maintain unauthorized access to the platform, potentially leading to misuse or manipulation of resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Deletion:** The attack vector involves the deletion of a user account by an administrator or any authorized process.
*   **Session Persistence:** The vulnerability is then exploited by the persistence of the user's session, which was not invalidated upon account deletion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Account Deletion:** The attacker doesn't need specific capabilities to trigger the vulnerability directly. The action of deleting a user account is assumed to be legitimate and performed by an authorized entity.
*   **Existing Session:** The 'attacker' (the deleted user) needs an active session before their account is deleted. This means they were logged in before the deletion. They must also remain logged in, not logging out after the account is deleted, in order to exploit the issue.
