The provided content details a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Xinhu RockOA v2.6.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-controlled parameters within the `inputChajian.php` file, specifically when processing the `def_` prefixed parameters via the `rock->get()` method. These parameters are then reflected in the HTML output without proper sanitization, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: User-supplied input is directly embedded into the HTML output without sanitization.
- Lack of input validation and output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they load the page.
- This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server with malicious JavaScript code injected into specific `def_` prefixed query parameters like `def_bookid`, `def_bookname`, `def_yjdt`, `def_jydt`, and `def_explain`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the injected payload.
- The victim must be tricked into clicking on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `/include/chajian/inputChajian.php` on multiple lines.
- The vulnerable parameters are: `def_bookid`, `def_bookname`, `def_yjdt`, `def_jydt` and `def_explain`.
- The vulnerability is difficult to find with traditional SAST due to the use of `$arr` and `$oarr` for parameter handling.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting JavaScript code in the mentioned parameters.
