  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient firmware validation on AudioCodes VoIP phones.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware (CWE-1326)",
       "The firmware update mechanism uses simple checksum checks, allowing modification of firmware components if the checksum is recalculated."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can store malicious firmware on AudioCodes IP phones, potentially gaining control over the device and network access.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting the firmware update mechanism.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to understand the firmware image structure, calculate checksums, and update firmware."
  },
  "additional_information": {
     "affected_products": "AudioCodes VoIP phones with firmware versions >= 3.4.4.1000",
     "proof_of_concept": "A manipulated firmware image was created by adding a root user in the rootfs.ext4 section. After recalculating and updating the checksums, the firmware was successfully installed on an AudioCodes IP phone. A Python script automates this process.",
