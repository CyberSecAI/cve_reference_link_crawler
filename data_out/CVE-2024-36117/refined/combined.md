# Path traversal while serving javadoc expanded files (arbitrary file read) (`GHSL-2024-074`)

High

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 3.3.0

## Patched versions

3.5.12

## Description

### Summary

Reposilite v3.5.10 is affected by an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability via path traversal while serving expanded javadoc files.

### Details

The problem lies in the way how the expanded javadoc files are served. The `GET /javadoc/{repository}/<gav>/raw/<resource>` route uses the `<resource>` path parameter to find the file in the `javadocUnpackPath` directory and returns it's content to the user.

[JavadocFacade.kt#L77](https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite/blob/68b73f19dc9811ccf10936430cf17f7b0e622bd6/reposilite-backend/src/main/kotlin/com/reposilite/javadocs/JavadocFacade.kt#L77):

```
fun findRawJavadocResource(request: JavadocRawRequest): Result<JavadocRawResponse, ErrorResponse> =
   with (request) {
       mavenFacade.canAccessResource(accessToken, repository, gav)
           .flatMap { javadocContainerService.loadContainer(accessToken, repository, gav) }
           .filter({ Files.exists(it.javadocUnpackPath.resolve(resource.toString())) }, { notFound("Resource $resource not found") })
           .map {
               JavadocRawResponse(
                   contentType = supportedExtensions[resource.getExtension()] ?: ContentType.APPLICATION_OCTET_STREAM,
                   content = Files.newInputStream(it.javadocUnpackPath.resolve(resource.toString()))
               )
           }
   }
```

In this case, the `<resource>` path parameter can contain path traversal characters such as `/../../`. Since the path is concatenated with the main directory, it opens the possibility to read files outside the `javadocUnpackPath` directory.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to Arbitrary File Read on the server. A potential attacker can read some sensitive file, such as `reposilite.db`, that contains the sqlite database used by Reposilite. This database contains the sensitive information used by Reposilite, including passwords and hashes of issued tokens. Also, the `configuration.cdn` file can be read, which contains other sensitive properties.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Start the Reposilite instance on <http://localhost:8080/>
2. Find at least one javadoc file in the hosted repositories. For example, the default test workspace contains the `/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/javadoc-1.0.0-javadoc.jar` archive that is suitable for our attack.
3. Send a GET request to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/javadoc/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/raw/%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2freposilite.db](http://127.0.0.1:8080/javadoc/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/raw/..%5C../../../../../reposilite.db)

   When this request is processed on the server, Reposilite tries to unpack the `/repositories/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/javadoc-1.0.0-javadoc.jar` file into the `/javadocs/releases/javadoc/1.0.0/.cache/unpack` folder. Then, it tries to read the `../../../../../../reposilite.db` file from this folder, which triggers the path traversal attack.

### Remediation

Normalize (remove all occurrences of `/../`) the `<resource>` path parameter before using it when reading the file. For example:

```
content = Files.newInputStream(it.javadocUnpackPath.resolve(resource.toPath()))
```

Changing `resource.toString()` to `resource.toPath()` is enough here as the `com.reposilite.storage.api.Location#toPath` method normalizes the string internally.

**Security**

In a collaboration with [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) *(big thanks to [@artsploit](https://github.com/artsploit) 🤍)* we've managed to resolve 3 vulnerabilities noticed in Reposilite:

* GHSL-2024-072
* GHSL-2024-073
* GHSL-2024-074

It is highly recommended to update your instances as soon as possible to mitigate the risks. For the time being, we're not revealing details on each one of them, but every instance running on versions between 3.3.0 to 3.5.11 should be considered as vulnerable.

We also recommend regenerating your access tokens, because those could be leaked via malicious Javadocs archives. As long as it's unlikely that you were affected, it's a general good practice in such cases.

**Other changes**

* Fixed invalid SHA checksums generated for files uploaded via the dashboard *(thanks [@laszlof](https://github.com/laszlof))*
* Bumped dependencies
