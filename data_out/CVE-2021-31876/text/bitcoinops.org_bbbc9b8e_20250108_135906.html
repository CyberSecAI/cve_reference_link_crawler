# Replace-by-fee (RBF)

*Also covering BIP125, Opt-in Replace-by-Fee, and Full-RBF*

**Replace-By-Fee (RBF)** is a node policy that allows an unconfirmed transaction in a mempool to be replaced with a different transaction that spends at least one of the same inputs and which pays a higher transaction fee.

Different node software can use different RBF rules, so there have
been several variations. The most widely-used form of RBF today is
[BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) **opt-in RBF** as
implemented in [Bitcoin Core 0.12.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.12.0/#opt-in-replace-by-fee-transactions) and subsequent
versions; this allows the creator of a transaction to signal that
they’re willing to allow it to be replaced by a higher-paying version.
An alternative form of RBF is **full-RBF** that allows any transaction to
be replaced whether or not it signals BIP125 replaceability.

BIP125 requires a replacement transaction to pay both higher feerate
(BTC/vbyte) and a higher absolute fee (total BTC). This can make
multiparty transactions that want to use RBF vulnerable to
[transaction pinning](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80803/what-is-meant-by-transaction-pinning) attacks, and so an occasional discussion
topic is proposals to allow RBF to operate solely on a feerate basis.
