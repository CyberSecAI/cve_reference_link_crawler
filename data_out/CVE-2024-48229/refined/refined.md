The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `funadmin` application, specifically within the "Curd One Click Command Mode" plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from directly inserting a user-controlled `joinTable` value into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't sanitize user-provided input before including it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `joinTable` parameter from the POST request is directly used in the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- Privilege Escalation: If the database user has higher privileges, the attacker can potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/curd/index/add` endpoint.
- Parameter manipulation: The `joinTable` parameter is manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Backend administrator privileges: The attacker needs to be authenticated as a backend administrator to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the `funadmin` application to send HTTP requests.

**Detailed Explanation:**
The vulnerability occurs in the `funadmin\app\curd\controller\Index.php` file when the `add` method is called with a malicious `joinTable` parameter. The `joinTable` value, received via a POST request, is passed through multiple functions until finally reaching `funadmin\vendor\funadmin\fun-addons\ src\curd\service\CurdService.php` where it gets concatenated directly into a SQL statement without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. The provided exploit code demonstrates an example of how to extract the database user name using SQL injection.
