{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem due to a flaw in `nvmet_ctrl_find_get` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially cause an information leak by sending a crafted TCP packet, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow leading to kmalloc data being printed to the kernel ring buffer (dmesg). This could expose sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote attacker sending a crafted TCP packet"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted TCP packet to a system with the vulnerable NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem"
}
