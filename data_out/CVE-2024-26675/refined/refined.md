Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26675:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The provided patches and commit messages from the Linux kernel git repository directly address a vulnerability related to setting the Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) in the `ppp_async` driver. Specifically, it mentions the `PPPIOCSMRU` ioctl and a related warning reported by syzbot, as well as referencing a similar fix in commit `c0a2a1b0d631`. This confirms the relevance to CVE-2024-26675.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The root cause is the lack of proper validation of the MRU value provided by the user through the `PPPIOCSMRU` ioctl in the `ppp_async` driver. Specifically, the code didn't check if the user-provided MRU value was greater than `U16_MAX`. This lack of validation allows for an excessively large MRU value to be set.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
- **Integer Overflow leading to large allocation**: A user could set an MRU value greater than `U16_MAX`, which due to missing input validation, could lead to very large allocations, causing a kernel panic when calling `__alloc_pages()` with a huge order.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The `ppp_async_ioctl` function fails to properly sanitize the MRU value provided by user space before using it.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
- **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service (DoS)**: By providing an excessively large MRU value through `PPPIOCSMRU`, an attacker could trigger a kernel panic due to failed allocation during sk_buff allocation, leading to a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors**
- **Local User Exploitation**: A local user with the ability to use the `PPPIOCSMRU` ioctl could trigger the vulnerability. The `ppp_async_ioctl` is called through the `ioctl` syscall.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
- The attacker must have the ability to call the `ioctl` syscall with the `PPPIOCSMRU` command on a ppp device. This typically requires local access and ability to interact with network devices.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patches add a check to ensure that the MRU value is not greater than `U16_MAX`, preventing the large allocation and subsequent kernel panic.
- The commit message mentions syzbot triggered the issue and is based on previous fixes for a similar issue in the ppp driver, indicating the bug was found through automated testing.
- The fixes are present across multiple kernel branches (stable tree) which indicates it affects multiple kernel versions.

In summary, the vulnerability in `ppp_async` allowed setting an arbitrary MRU, leading to large memory allocations and a kernel panic, exploitable by a local user who can call the `PPPIOCSMRU` ioctl. The fix involves adding a sanity check on the user-provided MRU value.
