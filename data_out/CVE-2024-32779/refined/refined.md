- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions that they should not be able to, leading to unauthorized access or modification of data. The specific impact would vary depending on the function being exploited.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to vulnerable functions without proper authentication or authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated.
