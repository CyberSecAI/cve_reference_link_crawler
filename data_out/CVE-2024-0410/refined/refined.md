The provided content describes a vulnerability related to bypassing code owner approvals in GitLab. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a combination of factors, including how GitLab handles merge requests (MRs) with protected files, the ability to reset commits locally, and the "Use Ours" conflict resolution mechanism during merge conflicts in GitLab UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypassing Code Owner Approvals:** The core weakness is the ability for a developer to circumvent the code owner approval process, designed to ensure specific files changes are reviewed before being merged. This circumvention happens by manipulating the commit history locally after an MR has been approved.
*   **Git Fuzzing:** The attacker exploits the Git commit history manipulation capabilities by resetting commits (`git reset head~2`) , amending commits (`git commit --amend --no-edit`), and force pushing (`git push origin BRANCH -f`) to introduce unapproved changes in protected files into an already approved MR.
*   **Flawed Conflict Resolution:** The "Use Ours" option during conflict resolution in the GitLab UI allows the attacker to merge their local changes, including the maliciously modified `.gitlab-ci.yml`, into the MR without requiring another approval.
*  **Inconsistent Change Detection**: GitLab's change detection for protected files is bypassed by amending the original commit. It appears that the system only checks the changes introduced by the initial commit, not the amended commit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unapproved Code Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary code into protected branches, bypassing the intended review and approval process.
*   **CI/CD Variable Exposure:** The injected code could lead to the disclosure of sensitive CI/CD variables if the attacker injects code that can expose them
*   **Compromised Project Integrity:** The ability to push unreviewed changes can compromise the security and integrity of the project.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Git Manipulation:** The attack requires the attacker to clone the repository, manipulate commit history locally using Git commands, and force-push changes.
*   **Merge Request Process:** The attack leverages the merge request process and specifically targets the conflict resolution mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Developer Role:** The attacker needs to have developer permissions within the GitLab project.
*   **Local Git Access:** The attacker must be able to clone the repository, manipulate it using Git, and push changes.
*   **Knowledge of Git Commands:** They need to know how to manipulate Git commits via `git reset`, `git commit --amend`, and force pushes (`git push -f`).

**Additional Details (From Content):**

*   The vulnerability requires the "Remove approvals by Code Owners if their files changed" setting to be enabled in project settings.
*   The attack can be performed even if the initial MR did not include any changes to the code owner protected files.
*   The provided video demonstrates the attack.

This vulnerability allows a malicious developer to bypass code owner approvals and merge unapproved code. It highlights a flaw in how GitLab handles changes made to commits that are already part of an approved merge request, and how GitLab handles conflicts during merge requests.
