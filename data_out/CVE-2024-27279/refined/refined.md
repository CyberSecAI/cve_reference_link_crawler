Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a directory traversal issue within the Ping sending functionality of a-blog cms. This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The Ping functionality does not properly sanitize or validate user input, specifically in the context of file paths, enabling an attacker to traverse the directory structure of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. This includes potentially sensitive files, such as password files and configuration files.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposing sensitive information can lead to further attacks or compromise the entire system and the data within it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The attack is performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged Access (PR:L):** The attacker needs to have at least editor-level access to the a-blog cms system and must be able to log in.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack does not require any interaction from the victim user other than having a privileged user login.

**Affected Versions:**
The following versions of a-blog cms are affected:
- a-blog cms Ver. 3.1.x series versions Ver.3.1.9 and earlier
- a-blog cms Ver. 3.0.x series versions Ver.3.0.30 and earlier
- a-blog cms Ver. 2.11.x series versions Ver.2.11.59 and earlier
- a-blog cms Ver. 2.10.x series versions Ver.2.10.51 and earlier
- a-blog cms Ver. 2.9.x and earlier (no fix available).

**Mitigation:**
- **Software Update:** The primary solution is to update a-blog cms to a fixed version, as provided by the vendor.
- **Workaround:** A temporary workaround involves deleting the `php/ACMS/POST/PingWeblogUpdate.php` file, which disables the vulnerable Ping functionality.
