## D-Link DAP-2622 DDP Configuration Restore Auth Password Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-1248ZDI-CAN-20070

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-35743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35743) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [DAP-2622](https://www.dlink.com/en/products/dap-2622-nuclias-connect-ac1200-wave-2-wall-plate-access-point) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-2622 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the DDP service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | D-Link has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

(Non-US) :: DAP-2622 :: H/W Rev. Ax :: F/W v1.00 :: ZDI-CAN TrendMicro :: Various Security Vulnerabilities Reported

**Overview**

On June 23, 2023, 3rd party security research from TrendMicro ZDI reported the (non-US/CA) D-Link DAP-2622 hardware revision Ax with firmware versions v1.00 as having multiple security vulnerability.

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
