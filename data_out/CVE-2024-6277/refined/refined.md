- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of input sanitization in `student.php?update=1`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to data modification, data exfiltration, or other database related attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the `student.php` page, specifically when the `update` parameter is set to `1`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `student.php` page with a malicious SQL payload in the input.
