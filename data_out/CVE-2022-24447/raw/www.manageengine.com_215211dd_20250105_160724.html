<h1>ManageEngine Key Manager Plus - Release Notes</h1>
<h3 id="7000">Key Manager Plus 7000 (Major) (Nov 2024)</h3>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>emSign CA Integration</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now integrates with emSign Certificate Authority (powered by eMudhra), a leading provider of SSL/TLS certificates and digital identity solutions. With this integration, users can seamlessly request, acquire, import, deploy, and revoke emSign-issued certificates directly through the Key Manager Plus interface. This enhances the certificate lifecycle management process by providing a centralized platform for managing all emSign certificates, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of certificate-related outages.<br />
    Explore this feature from the Integrations &gt;&gt; emSign section for comprehensive management options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enriched User Interface</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Key Manager Plus now features a completely revamped user interface, designed to provide a modern, intuitive, and optimized user experience. The new layout improves navigation, enhances usability, and offers a streamlined interface to help users manage tasks more efficiently and with ease. Key UI improvements include:
    <ul>
        <li>Customizable Dashboard</li>
        <li>Centralized CA Integrations Page</li>
        <li>Personalized UI Settings</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Audit tab now provides a comprehensive view of audit categories, improving the user experience by allowing streamlined access to all audit types in one place. The available audits include:
    <ul>
        <li>Discovery Audit</li>
        <li>Schedule Audit</li>
        <li>Key Association Audit</li>
        <li>Key Rotation Audit</li>
        <li>User Audit</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Previously, the CSR submitted via a file or content for public CA certificate requests was not saved in the Key Manager Plus CSR list. From now on, the CSR provided during the certificate request will be automatically added to the CSR tab upon submission, regardless of the method used for CSR input.</li>
    <li>Administrators can now enable or disable sharing CSR templates with users assigned the Operator role for creating certificate requests. Additionally, they have the option to either allow or restrict Operators from creating CSR only using the shared templates.     <br />
    <strong>Note: </strong>Operator role-relevant settings can now be accessed via Settings &gt; SSL &gt; Operator Settings, replacing the previous path Settings &gt; SSL &gt; Approval.</li>
    <li>The User Access Report now includes additional columns for Role and Email, which are also reflected in the new User Audit section.</li>
    <li><strong>RESTful API Updates:</strong><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Introducing the <strong>Update SSL Certificate</strong> API to update the SSL certificate details, including the additional field values.</li>
        <li><strong> Delete SSL Certificate</strong>  API has been enhanced with an option to exclude the certificate and provide a reason for its exclusion during the certificate deletion process.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Domains and IP addresses stored through Key Manager Plus integrations will now be automatically added to the Domain - Allowlist under Settings &gt;&gt; Privacy Settings. This enhancement ensures that only trusted domains can connect to Key Manager Plus, bolstering security. By default, commonly used Certificate Authority (CA) domains are pre-populated in the default allowlist, while any additional domains or IP addresses specified by the administrator will also appear in the Domain - Allowlist for easy management.</li>
    <li>In addition to fetching templates during ServiceDesk Plus ticketing system integration, Key Manager Plus now allows users to add ServiceDesk Plus templates as dropdown options in additional fields. This enhancement lets users map templates to certificates, enabling tickets to be sent with the appropriate templates for certificate expirations or SSL vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>The audit for certificate renewal settings in Key Manager Plus has been enhanced to display more detailed information.</li>
    <li>SSL certificates that require KeyStore passwords can now be utilized in the Jenkins build environment for organizations' freestyle projects, both during the build generation and post-build processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upgrade</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>jQuery has been upgraded from version 3.6.0 to 3.7.1 in the context of security, performance, and maintainability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fix</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Previously, certificates issued by the MSCA could not be deleted from Key Manager Plus installed on an MSCA server. This issue has now been resolved.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6680">Key Manager Plus 6680 (Minor) (August 2024)</h3>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GlobalSign Managed SSL</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports GlobalSign's managed SSL services, revolutionizing the SSL certificate procurement process by utilizing pre-vetted domains to bypass traditional domain validation. This enhancement significantly accelerates certificate issuance, drastically reducing the time and effort required to procure SSL certificates for pre-vetted domains. By leveraging MSSL's pre-vetted domains, organizations can streamline their SSL management process, ensuring faster, more efficient, and hassle-free certificate procurement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Using the multiple server deployment type, certificates can now be deployed to the Microsoft Certificate Stores of agents using the From File option with a list of installed agents.</li>
    <li>From this build onwards, SSL certificates can be discovered from the Microsoft Certificate Stores of agents using the From File option with a list of installed agents during the regular discovery process or MS Certificate Store Discovery schedule.</li>
    <li>Earlier, the Key Manager Plus agent should have been directly installed in the Microsoft Certificate Authority server to perform the SSL-based operations from Key Manager Plus. From now on, it is sufficient to install the Key Manager Plus agent on any server, provided the server has access to connect to the MSCA server.</li>
    <li>We have introduced the Email field on the CSR creation form.</li>
    <li>Users can now import SSH keys in bulk, provided the keys are passwordless or share the same passphrase.</li>
    <li>SSH keys can now be created with rsa-sha-256 and rsa-sha-512 key types.</li>
    <li>SSH keys can now be exported as either a public key or a private key as required.</li>
    <li>Key Manager Plus can now parse version 3 PuTTY Private Keys.</li>
    <li>We have added a consent checkbox in the SDP and MDM configuration for accessing the LAN to connect to the services/servers running on the LAN.</li>
    <li>As a best practice and preventive security measure, we have disabled the autofill and password settings for the Key Manager Plus application login.</li>
    <li>Henceforth, the certificates' serial number details will be available for the certificates managed in the Certificate Authority - The SSL Store.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Previously, the sync check status for SSL certificates deployed on servers via the Key Manager Plus agent was not functioning correctly in the multiple server window. This issue has now been resolved.</li>
    <li>Deploying certificates to the Microsoft Certificate Store using the Agent deployment type failed when the KeyStore password was blank. This issue has been fixed.</li>
    <li>In some instances, empty reports were generated during AWS discovery schedules or AWS certificate reports generation, even without active AWS credentials. This issue has now been resolved.</li>
    <li>An issue that affected the modification of schedules created with the SSL Discovery schedule type, using the discovery method From File, has been identified and fixed.</li>
    <li>When creating an Entrust certificate order using the Select CSR method, selecting a CSR with the KeyStore type set to KEY caused the certificate order to fail in the Key Manager Plus portal despite being created in the Entrust portal. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
    <li>When a certificate imported through an existing GlobalSign order is deleted from the SSL tab, the certificate order remains linked to the user who imports it to the Key Manager Plus repository. If another user attempts to import the existing orders using the identical GlobalSign credentials, they gain access to the certificate of the certificate order associated with the prior user. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
    <li>Previously, importing the existing orders from DigiCert failed, for instance, having more than 1000 orders. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
    <li>An issue that led to the failure of the Failover Service configuration has been found and fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Fix</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>We have added a few fixes for the prevention of Server Side Request Forgery and the usage of the static variable.</li>

<h3 id="6450">Key Manager Plus Release 6450 (Feb 2023)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SMTP OAuth Authentication</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports OAuth authentication for SMTP-based email communications to provide a secure channel for outbound emails from Key Manager Plus. With this, users can configure OAuth from Google or Microsoft Exchange Service as their mail server to send email notifications from Key Manager Plus. This process eliminates the need for the users to provide account credentials to authenticate the notification emails.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Certificates in Centralized Repository</strong><br />
    Users can now maintain server certificates in the Key Manager Plus' centralized SSL repository without affecting the available number of keys in the license.</li>
    <li><strong>FortiGate Firewall Discovery and Deployment</strong><br />
    Using Key Manager Plus, users will now be able to discover certificates from the FortiGate Firewalls. Users can also add and manage multiple FortiGate Firewall accounts and deploy certificates to them individually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A new option provided under <strong>'SSL &gt;&gt; Certificates &gt;&gt; Multiple Servers'</strong> allows users to add additional fields, such as character, date, and email, in the Multiple Servers page.</li>
    <li><strong>New REST API:</strong> In this release, we have added a new REST API -  Import CSR, to import the <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/information-center/what-is-certificate-signing-request.html?relnotes" target="_blank" title="Certificate Signing Request (CSR)">Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</a> by providing valid information.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to include the multiple server lists of the SSL certificates in the notification email of the SSL expiry schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Previously, the SSH and SSL discovery (including scheduled discovery) results included the IP address(es) provided in the 'Exclude IPAddress' field. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
    <li>Earlier, the certificate requests raised by a user was accessible to all other users with the operator role. From now on, the certificate requests will be accessible only to the administrators, apart from the users who created them.</li>
    <li>In the notification policy, email notifications pre-configured by administrators for the certification expiry, were sent at configured intervals without the subject or details. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
    <li>Previously, the IP and the DNS fields had similar entries when an IP was not resolved into DNS, thus creating duplicate entries on the multiple server page. We have fixed this issue now.</li>
    <li>In the notification policy, email notifications pre-configured by administrators for the expiry of PGP keys, were sent at configured intervals without the subject or details, even when no PGP keys were present. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
    <li>Earlier, in addition to the latest version, .Net Framework version 3.5 was required for IIS binding. From now on, any .Net Framework version above 4 will be sufficient to bind a certificate to a website in IIS.</li>
    <li>Previously, adding or updating the schedules used the client machine's date instead of the server's. We have fixed it now in this release.</li>
    <li>An issue that led the SSL discovery to fail with an exception message - 'certificates do not conform to algorithm constraint' has been fixed.</li>
    <li>There was an issue fetching some columns from the ServiceNow help desk that appear under 'Settings &gt;&gt; Ticketing system'. This issue has been fixed now.</li>

<p><strong>Enhancement</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Certificate Discovery using 'File' option for Microsoft Certificate Store</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports file-based certificate discovery for the Microsoft Certificate Store. This feature allows you to import a text file with a select list of hostnames/IP addresses that are accessible to Key Manager Plus, using which the remote machines are scanned and certificates are discovered. After a successful discovery, Key Manager Plus will consolidate the newly-discovered SSL certificates in its certificate repository. In addition, scheduled discovery of Microsoft Certificate Store certificates now comes with two new options: discovery using IP range and via a text file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3 id="6150">Key Manager Plus Release 6150 (September 2021)</h3>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Support for SAML-based Single-Sign-On (SSO)</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus integrates with federated identity management solutions to act as the SAML service provider and         works with SAML identity providers to offer single sign-on. Through this feature, you can leverage a third-party         SAML identity provider's authentication mechanism to access the Key Manager Plus interface without supplying         your existing local authentication credentials for Key Manager Plus. Key Manager Plus supports several SAML SSO         identity providers including, Okta, Azure SAML SSO, and AD FS.</li>
    <li><strong>New Tools Category Added:</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now comes with a 'Tools' category that will allow users to independently perform certificate         conversion, SSL/CSR parsing, and vulnerability scanning without adding certificates into the Key Manager Plus         repository. <br />
    <strong>i. Certificate Signing Requests (CSR) and SSL Parser - </strong>The parser tool allows users to upload         certificates or their contents directly to the interface and sort the attributes into a readable format. <br />
    <strong>ii. Certificate Format Converter - </strong>The converter tool supports one-click conversion for a wide         range of certificate formats. <br />
    <strong>iii. Scan Vulnerabilities - </strong>The scanner tool allows users to scan any domain for         vulnerabilities by entering the domain name and port directly. Unlike the SSL Vulnerability scan, this tool         checks for vulnerabilities in any domain, without adding the certificate to the repository.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificates Synchronization Status Check</strong><br />
    From Key Manager Plus build 6150 onwards, Key Manager Plus allows you to perform regular checks on the         synchronization status of SSL certificates deployed to multiple servers directly. Additionally, you can schedule         the synchronization check and generate a 'Certificate Sync Status' report based on the results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>From build 6150, after certificate renewal, the expired certificate's details can be sent via email. Configure         the required setting under 'Settings &gt;&gt; SSL &gt;&gt; Certificate Renewal'.</li>
    <li>From build 6150, Key Manager Plus will display the hosted SSL certificate's CommonName, Serial number, and         SyncStatus with the managed servers and include them in the 'Deployed Servers' report.</li>
    <li>Earlier, scheduled tasks were performed only during the scheduled time. Now, from build 6150 onwards, scheduled         tasks can be performed anytime by using the 'Execute' button available under the 'Schedules' tab.</li>
    <li>From build 6150, KMP allows you to check the SyncStatus using Agent. For this to work, the agent should also be         updated to version 6150.</li>
    <li>From build 6000, certificates were managed based on their Serial Number. From build 6150, certificates having         the same common name and different serial numbers can be grouped by enabling 'Managing Certificate History         Settings' under 'SSL &gt;&gt; Certificate History'.</li>
    <li>From build 6150, after certificate renewal, the old certificate will be listed under 'Certificate History'.</li>
    <li>From build 6150, Key Manager Plus allows you to add additional properties to CSR while signing with root by         using the 'Advanced Options' menu. It allows users to choose from a list of Key Usage and Advanced Key Usage         properties, and add them to the new certificate. Examples for the Key Usage properties include; Digital         Signature, Decipher Only, Encipher Only, and Certificate Sign.</li>
    <li>From build 6150, Key Manager Plus allows you to import PGP keys created using third party tools.</li>

Key Manager Plus then lets you filter the discovered SSL certificates based on the OS type such as iOS,         Android, Windows, Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Apple tvOS. It is also possible to export reports of the MDM         certificates managed in the Key Manager Plus repository within a selected period. Additionally, you can schedule         periodic generation of MDM certificate reports.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Certificate Discovery from UNC Shared Path for Linux/Mac OS</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports SSL certificate discovery from UNC (Universal Naming Convention) shared paths for         Linux and Mac OS machines. Use this feature to discover SSL certificates stored in a folder path within a server         that is accessible by Key Manager Plus. After the discovery, Key Manager Plus will consolidate the         newly-discovered SSL certificates in its certificate repository. This option is also available during scheduled         certificate discovery.</li>
    <li><strong>MSCA Discovery with Agent using Multiple Templates</strong><br />
    Users can now select up to five certificate templates while performing agent-based certificate discovery of         local CA certificates. Before using this enhancement, please ensure if the Agent is upgraded to version 6000.</li>
    <li><strong>Support for .CRT Extension</strong><br />
    Henceforth, certificates can be exported/deployed with the .CRT extension too.</li>
    <li><strong>Search-Enabled Custom Columns</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus allows you to search within custom columns for SSL Certificates and SSH keys.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Servers List</strong><br />

    <li><strong>GoDaddy Certificates Import</strong><br />
    From now on, users can directly import the existing certificates from their GoDaddy account into the Key Manager         Plus repository.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Disassociation of Keys</strong><br />
    It is now possible to dissociate keys locally if remote dissociation fails for users whose access has been         discontinued.</li>
    <li><strong>New Fields in the deployCertificate Rest API</strong><br />
    In the deployCertificate Rest API, serial number and server name have been added in input data, where the server         name is an optional field used to select a specific server to deploy a certificate.</li>
    <li><strong>APIs - Serial Number as the Mandatory Field</strong><br />
    Earlier, the Serial Number field, which was optional in the below APIs, has now been made mandatory; To get a         certificate, To get certificate keystore, and To delete a certificate.</li>
    <li><strong>Serial Number in the getCertificateDetails Rest API</strong><br />
    In the getCertificateDetails Rest API, Serial Number has been added as an optional field, filling which fetches         the details of that particular certificate alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>During SSL discovery, discovery from servers with mutual authentication failed. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
    <li>In build 5970, the Agent authentication failed for AD Users. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Behavior Change </strong></p>
<p>From now on, all certificates with unique serial numbers will be listed under the 'Certificates' tab. However, the     existing users can manage their already added certificates from the History section, which has now been moved under     the Column Chooser.</p>

<h3 id="5960">Key Manager Plus Release 5960 (November 2020)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Certificate Discovery from UNC Shared Path</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports SSL certificate discovery from UNC (Universal Naming Convention) shared paths. Use         this feature to discover SSL certificates stored in a folder path within a server that is accessible by Key         Manager Plus. After the discovery, Key Manager Plus will consolidate the newly-discovered SSL certificates in         its certificate repository. This option is available during scheduled certificate discovery also.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate Discovery in DMZ Machines using Agent</strong><br />
    It is now possible to discover the SSL certificates from directories in remote machines that are not directly         accessible by Key Manager Plus&mdash;all through the Key Manager Plus Agent. This option is available during         scheduled certificate discovery also.</li>
    <li><strong>Browser Deployment of Certificates </strong><br />
    Users will now be able to deploy SSL certificates in browsers from Key Manager Plus for the following server         types: Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li>
    <li><strong>SSH Key Association using &quot;Elevate to root user&quot; Option </strong><br />
    This release comes with the new &quot;Elevate to root user&quot; option. Now, as a security measure, it is         possible to restrict users from directly accessing root users by disabling the root user login. Enabling this         option elevates a user login from a non-root user to a root user and associate keys to all other users in the         server.</li>
    <li><strong>New RestApi </strong><br />
    The new REST API, 'Deploy Certificate', has been added.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>

    <li>Users can now select up to five certificate templates while performing template-based SSL certificate discovery.</li>
    <li>Users can now bypass proxy server settings while performing SSL certificate discovery. If this option is         selected, Key Manager Plus will bypass the proxy server and directly perform online certificate discovery. This         option is available during scheduled certificate discovery also.</li>
    <li>Earlier, after certificate renewal, users will have to deploy MSCA/-self-signed certificates manually. Now, it         is possible to deploy these certificates automatically if the user credentials are available.</li>
    <li>Users will now be able to choose the Certificate type [CER/DER/P7B] and Keystore type [JKS/PKCS/PEM/KEY] while         deploying Certificates to Windows and Linux machines and while exporting certificates.</li>
    <li>Now, it is possible to renew MSCA type Certificates with a new private key if a private key not available         already.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Earlier, it was possible to add or modify IISBinding only by giving the 'hostname'. This issue has been fixed,         and now 'hostname' is not mandatory to create or update IISBinding.</li>
    <li>Certificates renewal happened without SAN names when the renewal was carried out using the 'Renew'' button in         inventory.</li>
    <li>Earlier, MSCA templates showed the OID instead of the template name. This issue is fixed.</li>
</ul>
<hr id="5950" />
<h3 id="5950">Key Manager Plus Release 5950 (August 2020)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>On-demand Renewal of Certificates</strong><br />
    This release comes with a 'Renew' option under 'SSL &gt;&gt; Certificates' that allows users to initiate the         renewal of Self Signed, Root Signed, Microsoft CA Signed, and Agent-signed certificates, and also the         certificates issued by the third-party CAs.</li>

Supported LDAP server types are Microsoft         Active Directory and OpenLDAP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Key Manager Plus now supports scheduled SSL discovery and MS Certificate Store Discovery tasks with agent.</li>
    <li>Previously, the certificates due for expiry in 10 days or less got automatically renewed. Now, users will be         able to customize the number of days to auto-renew the certificates before they expire.</li>
    <li>From now on, during CSR signing of SSL certificates using the agent, it is possible to specify the Agent timeout         value, in seconds.</li>
    <li>Henceforth, users will be able to select specific Certificates or Certificate Groups while generating the 'SSL         Certificates Report' Schedule type (under 'Schedule &gt;&gt; Add Schedule').</li>
    <li>Users will now be able to add and edit the deployed servers list under 'SSL &gt;&gt; Certificates &gt;&gt;         Multiple Servers (icon)'. Newly added servers will be mapped with the latest certificate version in the         certificate repository.</li>
    <li>Key Manager Plus now supports IP range discovery for MS Certificate store discovery ('Discovery &gt;&gt; MS         Certificate Store') using the KMP service with the domain Admin account. This allows administrators to discover         certificates across networks.</li>
    <li>Key Manager Plus now supports 'Load Balancer' Certificates discovery for 'SSL Discovery' schedule type. Use this         schedule type to discover certificates from load balancers, such as BIG-IP F5, Nginx, etc., which support SSH         access on a scheduled basis.</li>
    <li>Certificates and CSR generation pages have been enhanced with the Random Password generation feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Under 'Settings &gt;&gt; SSL &gt;&gt; IIS Binding', binding list retrieval failed for bindings with a protocol         other than HTTP/HTTPs. This issue has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Earlier during Digicert import, Key Manager Plus failed to import client/personal certificates into KMP. This         issue is now fixed.</li>
    <li>Earlier, the date format had the month as a part of the value, due to which sorting did not work. Now, this         issue has been resolved by modifying the date format in the CSV file to be the standard date format.</li>
    <li>Earlier while discovering certificates using a load balancer, there were problems with commands other than the         standard Linux commands. This issue has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Get templates issue fixed for CA name-based fetch.</li>
    <li>Previously, the proxy configuration was not supported in GlobalSign integration, due to which users with proxy         were unable to use the integration. This issue has been fixed now.</li>

<h3>Key Manager Plus Release 5910 (May 2020)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New Certificate Format - PEM</strong><br />
    A new certificate format, Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), has been added, in addition to the already available         certificate export formats, Keystore and PFX, where the PEM format is used for digital certificates and keys,         deployed in web server platforms (e.g., Apache).</li>
    <li><strong>Support for GoDaddy DNS</strong><br />
    From now on, Key Manager Plus supports GoDaddy DNS to complete the domain control validation procedure while         acquiring certificates from public Certificate Authorities, along with the already available DNS support types,         Azure DNS, Cloudflare DNS, Amazon route 53, and RFC2136 Update. Using GoDaddy DNS, users can update the DNS         record for GoDaddy domain validation from the Key Manager Plus portal itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>This release comes with an exclusive page for 'Windows Agents', accessible from the SSL tab, from where users         will be able to perform all agent-specific operations such as SSL Discovery using agent, deployment of SSL         certificates in certificate groups using agent and CSR Signing with MSCA agent.</li>
    <li>Certificate deployment in multiple servers has now been made simpler by using an agent, provided the agent is         running in the server to be deployed, and both the agent name and the server DNS name are the same.</li>
    <li>Now, auto-renewal of certificates is possible for the 'MSCA using agent' sign type as well, from 'Settings         &gt;&gt; SSL &gt;&gt; Certificate Renewal'.</li>
    <li>The 'Certificate Sign Report' comes with the following MSCA/Third party CA signing details; Certificate         Authority, Certificate Template, Sign Type column.</li>
    <li>The 'Certificate Renewal report' comes with the 'Renewed By' column relevant to MSCA and 3rdPartyCA renewal         details.</li>
    <li>A new option 'Reissue Certificate' has been added under 'SSL &gt;&gt; GlobalSign' that allows users to request         GlobalSign to reissue an SSL certificate.</li>
    <li>The new 'GlobalSign Orders Report' allows the GlobalSign orders to be added as individual reports, which provide         a detailed view of certificate orders requested from the GlobalSign CA.</li>
    <li>From now on, users can add a &quot;Key Comment' while importing a new SSH key and editing an existing key from         the repository. Also, users can avail the checkbox &quot;Update comment in associated users&quot; to update the         Key comment to the associated end servers automatically.</li>
    <li>Now, it is possible to add additional properties to a certificate while creating it, by using the 'Advanced         Options' menu. It allows users to choose from a list of Key Usage and Advanced Key Usage properties, and add         them to the new certificate.

<hr id="5900" />
<h3>Key Manager Plus Release 5900 (March 2020)</h3>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GlobalSign</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now supports integration with GlobalSign SSL&mdash;atrusted certificate authority and a leading         cloud-based PKI solutions provider. This integration enables users to request, acquire, import, deploy, renew         and automate the end-to-end lifecycle management of SSL/TLS certificates issued by GlobalSign, directly from the         Key Manager Plus web interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate Deployment using Agent</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus can already deploy and bind certificates to IIS servers belonging to the domain, where Key         Manager Plus also resides. Now, Key Manager Plus can also deploy certificates to IIS servers in demilitarized         zones and also bind them to websites in IIS, all using an agent. This makes Key Manager Plus more scalable, as         it can deploy and bind certificates in IIS servers, irrespective of whether they are in the same or different         domain.</li>
    <li><strong>CSR Signing using Agent</strong><br />
    In addition to the already available two sign types namely, 'MS Certificate Authority' and 'Sign with Root',         used to sign certificates from Key Manager Plus, a third sign type 'MS Certificate Authority with Agent' has         been introduced. This new sign type is mainly used to sign certificates originating from a distinct domain,         i.e., other than the domain to which Key Manager Plus belongs.</li>
    <li><strong>System Integration - ServiceDesk Plus and Service Now</strong><br />
    From release 5900, Key Manager Plus integrates with enterprise ticketing systems namely ServiceDesk Plus         (on-premise) and ServiceNow. This integration ensures that automatic service requests are created in the         ticketing environment to notify administrators of SSL certificates that are at the risk of expiring and         certificates that are deemed vulnerable after a vulnerability scan in Key Manager Plus. Users can set         notification policies to govern the frequency of service request creation for expiring and vulnerable tickets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is now possible to customize notifications and their intervals. Users can now choose not to receive         notifications regarding the expired certificates, and send a separate email and customized subject per         certificate, from <strong>'Settings &gt;&gt; Notification'</strong>. The same actions can be done while creating         new schedules under <strong>'Schedule &gt;&gt; Add Schedule'</strong>, where you have to select the Schedule         Type as 'SSL Expiry'.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to bulk edit the additional fields for multiple SSH keys and certificates.</li>
    <li>The column chooser was introduced in the version 5850 in the SSL window. Now, the IP address and Port are added         in the column chooser which allows the users to display the selected columns in the list view.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to provide ephemeral access (validity in hours and minutes) to certificates created using the         'Create Certificate' Rest API.</li>
    <li>Earlier, Key Manager Plus allowed signing and deployment of certificates only from Windows systems. Now, it is         possible to perform certificate signing and deployment to Windows systems from Linux installations through         agents.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to provide customized subjects in schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Enhancement</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, PostgreSQL data directories in Windows installations were entirely accessible to all locally authenticated     users. Now, as a security practice, we have exerted the following measures, applicable for installations under the     'Program Files' directory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No inherited permissions are allowed for data and configurations directories</li>
    <li><strong>&quot;Authenticated Users&quot;</strong> permission has been excluded entirely</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the CREATOR OWNER, SYSTEM, Installation User, NT AUTHORITY\Network Service and Administrators groups will have     the Full Control over the directories and also can start PostgreSQL.</p>
<hr id="5860" />
<h3>Key Manager Plus Release 5860 (January 2020)</h3>
<p><strong>New Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Keys</strong><br />
    PGP encryption is used to enhance cryptographic privacy and authentication for online communication by         encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, files, etc. It uses a combination of data compression, hashing, and         public-key cryptography to boost confidentiality. Now, Key Manager Plus brings you this PGP functionality in the         form of PGP key generation, where the keys are used to encrypt the data like emails, texts, etc. Create, store         and manage PGP keys under 'KMP &gt;&gt; Key Store &gt;&gt; PGP Keys'. Modify the key description anytime, export         private/public keys, export keys to multiple email ids, and generate, view, and schedule reports. You can         also&nbsp;send expiry notification emails to admins. This feature allows you to share and collaborate         information securely among your trusted groups of users and businesses.</li>
</ul>
<hr id="5850" />
<h3>Key Manager Plus Release 5850 (December 2019)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SSL Certificate Deployment and Binding - IIS Server</strong><br />
    From&nbsp;release 5850, you can both deploy a certificate to the IIS server and also bind it to the desired         website in the IIS, all from the Key Manager Plus interface itself, without the need to access the IIS server         separately. Also, an option has been provided to automatically restart the IIS server for the deployment and         binding to take effect, thereby eliminating the need for the manual restart from the IIS end.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Fields</strong><br />
    Key Manager Plus now brings you the 'Additional Fields' feature, configured from 'Settings &gt;&gt; General         Settings' that is used to include any additional information about SSH keys and SSL certificates, stored in the         repository. There are four different categories to add the additional fields: character, numeric, date and         email. Users can choose to add or remove the additional fields from SSH and SSL views.</li>
    <li><strong>Column Chooser</strong><br />
    The 5850 version of Key Manager Plus comes with the Column Chooser feature that allows users to show or hide         columns at runtime, and also rearrange the columns from the current view via drag-and-drop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Now, it is possible to use the Key Manager Plus service account credentials for authentication while deploying         certificates in Windows servers.</li>
    <li>Henceforth, while creating a certificate, users can provide ephemeral access (validity in hours and minutes) to         the certificate, after which the certificate auto-expires. This eliminates the need for compulsory permanent         access credentials to access target systems and also explicit access repeal.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to perform SNI-based SSL discovery using the Common Name and IP Address combination.</li>
    <li>The option to filter certificates based on the key length and signature algorithm within specific expiry days         has been added to the 'getAllSSLCertificates' Rest API.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>During all AD-related operations performed from the Key Manager Plus interface, the 'Connection Mode' got saved         as 'No SSL' only, even if the 'SSL' mode was chosen. This issue has been fixed now.</li>
    <li>Earlier, MSCA signing supported 'java keytool' CSR only. Now, from this release, all CSRs will be supported by         MSCA signing.</li>
    <li>During certificate creation, all values entered in the SAN field were all together categorized as 'DNS' only.         Now, the values are segregated as 'DNS' and 'IP Address' categories.</li>
</ul>
<hr id="5810" />

<h3>Key Manager Plus - Release 4.0 (June, 2016)</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SSL Certificate Management</strong>- Key Manager Plus provides visibility and centralized control over         the entire life cycle of SSL certificates across any network and thereby helps prevent downtime, compliance         issues, and security breaches.
    <p>Highlights of SSL certificate management include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Discovers all SSL certificates deployed in the network, irrespective of the                 issuing certificate authority (CA), including self-signed ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized Inventory</strong>: Consolidates all discovered certificates and stores them in a                 secure, centralized repository for easy access and management.</li>
        <li><strong>Track Certificate Details</strong>: Tracks all certificate information, including name of the                 CA, date of issue, encryption algorithm, key length and other vital details.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Certificate Signing Requests</strong>: Centrally controls new CSR process. Handles                 key-pair creation process and provides ready-to-use CSR data files to be sent to the CA for getting new                 certificates.</li>
        <li><strong>Expiration Alerts</strong>: Tracks certificate validity and sends alerts about the certificates                 that are about to expire. Generates reports on expiry status of certificates.</li>
        <li><strong>Flag SHA-1 Certificates</strong>: Identifies certificates that use SHA-1 hashing function (which                 is found to be weak), prompting administrators to revoke the certificates and create new ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Compliance</strong>: Ensures that the encryption algorithms and underlying key lengths                 comply with various industry regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Key Store</strong>- Key Manager Plus provides a secure repository for the storage of any digital key.
    <p>Using the Key Store feature of Key Manager Plus, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add any digital key file (&lt; 1MB) to the Key Manager Plus repository.</li>
        <li>Map the digital key to a particular application, instance, and location (i.e, AWS, Azure data centers                 etc), to easily locate, track, and maintain them.</li>
        <li>Maintain versions of the digital key files.</li>
        <li>Generate report of all digital keys in use along with their details.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Earlier, for SSH key management, user accounts could be added only if their associated credentials were         provided. Now, a feature has been added to manage users using only SSH key pairs (without providing their         passwords).</li>
    <li><strong>SSH Private Key Group</strong> : This enhancement helps to organize SSH private keys as a logical group         and execute key rotation, report creation, key group deployment and other operations in bulk.</li>
    <li><strong>SSH User Group</strong> : This enhancement helps to organize SSH users into a group and execute actions         in bulk on the group.</li>
    <li>Earlier, the private keys were deployed in the default location. Now, option has been provided to change the         remote server user account authorized_key file location (i.e /home/test/.ssh to var/home/test/.ssh) both in bulk         and for individual user accounts.</li>
    <li>Support is now provided for JUNOS based Juniper devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Earlier, licensing was based on the number of SSH users. Henceforth, licensing would be based on the number of         keys, which includes SSH private keys, SSL certificates, and the number of keys in the Key Store, which are         managed using Key Manager Plus.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kmp_upgradepack_instructions">Instructions to apply the Upgrade Pack</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Take a copy of the entire Key Manager Plus installation folder before applying the upgrade pack and keep it in some other location. If something goes wrong with the Key Manager Plus upgrade, you can rely on the copy. Also ensure that you stop the Key Manager Plus server before applying the upgrade pack. All your settings will remain intact.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stop the Key Manager Plus service. Take a backup of the entire Key Manager Plus installation folder and store it in some other location. In case something goes wrong with the upgrade, you can revert to this copy, with your settings intact.</li>
    <li>The upgrade pack is to be applied through a tool named UpdateManager bundled with Key Manager Plus. To begin the upgrade, navigate to the <strong>&lt;Key Manager Plus_Installation_Folder&gt;/bin</strong> directory and execute the command UpdateManager.bat to start the Update Manager.</li>
    <img src="/key-manager/images/updatemanager-2.png" alt="update manager" />
    <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> and select the .ppm file that you downloaded. As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP  build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to complete the upgrade process. Click <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/certificate/ppmsigner_publickey.crt">here</a> to download the SSL certificate to be imported.</li>
    <li>In the pop-up that opens, click <strong>Browse</strong> and import the SSL certificate you downloaded from the aforementioned page.</li>
    <img src="/key-manager/images/import-certificate-2.png" alt="import certificate" />
    <li>Click <strong>Install</strong> in the Update Manager window to begin the upgrade process. Wait for a few minutes until the upgrade pack is fully installed. Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Close</strong> and then click <strong>Exit</strong> to exit the Update Manager tool. If you are applying multiple upgrade packs one-by-one, exit the Update Manager tool after applying one upgrade pack and make sure that the database process is not running. Then proceed with running the Update Manager tool to apply the next upgrade pack and so on</li>
    <li>Also, when applying multiple upgrade packs sequentially, it is recommended that you start the Key Manager Plus service after each upgrade to ensure the corresponding build version runs successfully without any issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="table-border">
<p><span class="font-clr">Note: </span></p>
<p>In case you store the<strong> database_params.conf</strong> file at a different location, you must copy the file back to the original location (i.e. &lt;Key Manager Plus_Installation_Folder&gt;/conf/) before performing the upgrade.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stop KMP service using the command <strong>/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshkeymanager-service stop.</strong></li>
    <li>The upgrade pack is to be applied through a tool named <strong>UpdateManager</strong> bundled with Key Manager Plus. To begin the upgrade, navigate to<strong> &lt;Key Manager Plus_Installation_Folder&gt;/bin</strong> directory using a terminal.</li>
    <li>Execute the command<strong>sh UpdateManager.sh -c</strong> (This will run the Update Manager in CLI mode)</li>
    <li>Now, press i to install. Supply full path of the upgrade pack.</li>
    <li>As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to install the upgrade. Download the certificate from <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/certificate/ppmsigner_publickey.crt">this</a> link.</li>
    <li>Enter the SSL certificate's absolute path when prompted. Once the certificate is imported successfully, wait for the upgrade to complete until the message &quot;Service Pack applied successfully&quot; is displayed. Please note that the SSL certificate import is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.</li>
    <li>If you are applying multiple upgrade packs, do the following for each upgrade; exit the Update Manager, start &amp; stop the KMP service once, and execute the upgrade steps.</li>
    <li>After applying the upgrade packs, login as a root user and start the KMP service, using <strong>/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshkeymanager-service start.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="table-border">
<p><span class="font-clr">Note: </span></p>
<p>Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade.</p>

<h3>Failover Service (FOS) Setup</h3>
<p>In a failover service set up with two application servers bound to an MS SQL cluster, you can upgrade only the primary server; the secondary server must be reinstalled and the failover service setup must be reconfigured.</p>
<p>Summary of steps to be followed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deactivate the failover service.</li>
    <li>Upgrade the primary application server.</li>
    <li>Reinstall the secondary application.</li>
    <li>Reconfigure the failover service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deactivate Failover Service</h3>
<p>You can deactivate the failover service either from the primary or the secondary server.</p>
<p>To uninstall:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open a command prompt in any of the servers</li>
    <li>Navigate to &lt;keymanagerplus_installation_folder&gt;/<strong>bin</strong> directory</li>
    <li>Execute the command: <strong>UninstallFOS.bat</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, the failover service will be deactivated. Next, you can uninstall Key Manager Plus application completely from the other servers.</p>
<h3>Upgrade the Primary Application server</h3>
<p>You can upgrade your primary installation of Key Manager Plus by following the below steps. The latest upgrade packs are available <a href="#scroll">above</a> . You can use the instructions mentioned here to apply the upgrade packs one by one to reach the latest version. If MS SQL is configured as back end, do take a backup of database present in MS SQL Server</p>
<div class="table-border">
<p><span class="font-clr">Note: </span></p>
<p>Before upgrading, we recommend you take a backup of the entire Key Manager Plus directory. This will be useful if there are any technical issues causing upgrade failure and you can immediately revert to the existing version by deleting the Key Manager Plus directory and placing the backup directory in the same location to get your Key Manager Plus instance up and running again.</p>
</div>
<h3>Upgrade steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stop the Key Manager Plus service and exit the tray icon.</li>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>&lt;Key Manager Plus_Installation_Folder&gt;/bin</strong> directory from CMD and execute <strong>UpdateManager.bat</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>During MS SQL server configuration for Key Manager Plus database, if you have opted for 'Windows Authentication,' you have to start the command prompt using the service account with which the Key Manager Plus service has been configured to connect to the SQL server (i.e. instead of running as administrator, run as the service account).</li>
        <li>To identify whether a service account is used or a SQL account is used, navigate to <strong>&lt;Key Manager Plus_Installation_Folder&gt;/conf</strong> directory and open<strong>database_params.conf</strong> file. If you do not find a username and password in the file, then Key Manager Plus is using Windows Authentication and therefore you need to run the command prompt with service account privilege.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> and select the .ppm file that you downloaded. As a part of patch integrity verification from KMP build 6300 onwards, you must import an SSL certificate to complete the upgrade process. Click here to download the SSL certificate to be imported.</li>
    <li>In the pop-up that opens, click <strong>Browse</strong> and import the SSL certificate you downloaded from the aforementioned page.</li>
    <li>Click Install in the Update Manager window to begin the upgrade process. Wait for a few minutes until the upgrade pack is fully installed. Please note that importing the SSL certificate is mandatory while upgrading KMP from version 6.2 to 6.3. However, this is a one-time operation and you need not repeat the process during the next version upgrade</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Close</strong> and then click <strong>Exit</strong> to exit the Update Manager tool. If you are applying multiple upgrade packs one-by-one, exit the Update Manager tool after applying one upgrade pack and make sure that the database process is not running. Then proceed with running the Update Manager tool to apply the next upgrade pack and so on.</li>
    <li>If you are applying multiple upgrade packs, do the following for each upgrade; exit the Update Manager, start &amp; stop the Key Manager Plus service once, and execute the upgrade steps.</li>
    <li>After applying the upgrade packs, start the Key Manager Plus service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reinstall KMP on the Secondary Application Server</h3>
<p>After upgrading the primary server to the latest version, You can reinstall the latest version of Key Manager Plus on your secondary server.     Note: Ensure the software architectures are the same i.e. 32-bit/64-bit. You can download Key Manager Plus from this <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/download.html">link.</a></p>
<h3>Reconfigure Failover Service</h3>
<p>After reinstalling the secondary server, you can perform the steps detailed in the <a href="https://www.manageengine.com/key-manager/help/failover-service.html">failover service help documentation</a> to configure failover service in the secondary application server again.</p>
