- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security misconfiguration allows an attacker to authenticate as the Crowd application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control and the ability to call privileged endpoints in Crowd's REST API under the `/usermanagement` path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access and execute privileged actions within Crowd via the REST API.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by IPs specified in the crowd application allowlist in the Remote Addresses configuration. By default, this list is empty, meaning the attacker needs to be on the network or able to add themselves to it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be on an allowed IP address, as specified in the Remote Addresses configuration of the Crowd application. By default, no IPs are allowed, so the attacker would have to change this setting.
