### Description

Affected versions of Atlassian Crowd allow an attacker to authenticate as the crowd application via security misconfiguration and call privileged endpoints in Crowd's REST API under the usermanagement path.

This vulnerability can only be exploited by IPs specified under the crowd application allowlist in the Remote Addresses configuration, which is none by default.

The affected versions are all versions 3.x.x, versions 4.x.x before version 4.4.4, and versions 5.x.x before 5.0.3

**Affected versions:**

* 3.x.x
* 4.x.x < 4.4.4
* 5.x.x < 5.0.3

**Fixed versions:**

* 4.4.4
* 5.0.3
* 5.1.0

**Mitigation/Workaround:**

To remediate this vulnerability, update each affected product installation to a fixed version listed above.

If you’re unable to upgrade Crowd, a temporary mitigation is to remove or validate any Remote Addresses for crowd application in the Crowd product. You can navigate to the Remote Address configuration by following the document [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd/specifying-an-application-s-address-or-hostname-25788433.html), and remove any remote addresses accordingly.

Additionally, change password for the crowd application to a strong password especially if a remote address is necessary.
