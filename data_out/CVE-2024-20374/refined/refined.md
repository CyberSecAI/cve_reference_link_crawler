- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of certain HTTP request parameters sent to the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-269, which is related to improper privilege management. Although, the specific weakness is an injection flaw allowing command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the *root* user on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must authenticate to the Cisco FMC web-based management interface and send a crafted HTTP request to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs *Administrator*-level credentials to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable management interface.

The advisory provides additional context that, while administrator accounts on vulnerable devices can execute commands through expert mode, the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass restrictions such as those in multi-instance deployments or systems configured with the `system lockdown-sensor` command and gain expert mode access.
