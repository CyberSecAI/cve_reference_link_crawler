- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not restrict unauthenticated access to certain pages of the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication (CWE-287) leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete log files without authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required; the attacker needs network access to the device.
