WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not access links from untrusted sources while logged in at SICAM P850 or SICAM P855 devices

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines can be found at:

https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM P850 multifunctional measuring device is used for acquisition, visualization, evaluation and
transmission of electrical measured variables such as alternating current, alternating voltage, frequency,
power, harmonics etc.

The SICAM P855 multifunctional device is used to collect, display and transmit measured electrical
variables such as AC current, AC voltage, power types, harmonics, etc. The measurands and events are
collected and processed according to the Power Quality Standard IEC 61000-4-30.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-29872

Affected devices do not properly validate parameters of POST requests. This could allow an authenti-
cated attacker to set the device to a denial of service state or to control the program counter and, thus,
execute arbitrary code on the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-29873

Affected devices do not properly validate parameters of certain GET and POST requests. This could
allow an unauthenticated attacker to set the device to a denial of service state or to control the program
counter and, thus, execute arbitrary code on the device.

is directly reﬂected in the web server response. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to
perform reﬂected XSS attacks.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2022-29878

Affected devices use a limited range for challenges that are sent during the unencrypted challenge-
response communication. An unauthenticated attacker could capture a valid challenge-response pair
generated by a legitimate user, and request the webpage repeatedly to wait for the same challenge
to reappear for which the correct response is known. This could allow the attacker to access the
