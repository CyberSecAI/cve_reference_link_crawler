In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_net: Fix napi_skb_cache_put warning

After the commit bdacf3e34945 ("net: Use nested-BH locking for
napi_alloc_cache.") was merged, the following warning began to appear:

	 WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1 at net/core/skbuff.c:1451 napi_skb_cache_put+0x82/0x4b0

	  __warn+0x12f/0x340

The issue arises because virtio is assuming it's running in NAPI context
even when it's not, such as in the netpoll case.

To resolve this, modify virtnet_poll_tx() to only set NAPI when budget
is available. Same for virtnet_poll_cleantx(), which always assumed that
it was in a NAPI context.
