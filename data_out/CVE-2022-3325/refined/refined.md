{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The instance level setting `Prevent editing approval rules in projects and merge requests` greys out the `Approvals required` approval rule attribute, but does not prevent editing of approval rules via the API. The group level setting has no effect.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The UI setting does not properly enforce the restriction on editing approval rules. The API does not enforce the setting."
    ],
    "impact": "A Maintainer can bypass the intended restrictions and change approval rules, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the merge request process.",
    "attack_vectors": "By using the browser's developer tools to enable the UI element that is greyed out, and directly interacting with the API.",
    "required_capabilities": "Maintainer role within the project. Ability to use browser's developer tools to modify the UI."
  }
