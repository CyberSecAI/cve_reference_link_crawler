{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The interrupt handler for the qDMA (Queue Direct Memory Access) was initialized before the registers were configured. This could lead to the interrupt handler processing interrupts that were pending from a primary kernel before it was ready to do so.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect initialization order of the qDMA driver",
      "Interrupt handler being invoked prematurely"
    ],
    "impact": "A race condition during initialization of the fsl-qdma driver which could result in a kernel panic.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs during device initialization when the qDMA driver is probed. If interrupts are pending from a previous kernel, they might be processed by the handler before it is ready, resulting in a crash.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required, the vulnerability is triggered during normal system boot. A system with an affected fsl-qdma driver being used to perform DMA operations is required."

  "patch": {
    "description": "The fix involves reordering the initialization sequence to ensure the irq (interrupt request) handler is initialized after the registers are configured using the fsl_qdma_reg_init() function.",
    "changes": "The fsl_qdma_irq_init() function call was moved from before the register initialization to after the registers are initialized.",
