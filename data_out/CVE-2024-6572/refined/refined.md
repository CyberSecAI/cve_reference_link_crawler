- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The special agent *VNX quotas and filesystems* and the active check *Check SFTP Service* were not properly checking host keys when establishing SSH connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing host key verification when using SSH connections.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in a machine-in-the-middle position could intercept the connection and potentially retrieve sensitive information, such as passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker intercepts network traffic between the Checkmk server and the target host.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Checkmk server and the target host using SSH.
