The provided content describes an XXE vulnerability in AgileReporter 21.3 by VERMEG.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. Specifically, the "Config Package Binding" -> "Manage Execution Groups" option allows uploading XML files which are not sanitized against malicious XML entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of external entities in XML files.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Attackers can leverage the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Directory Listing:** Attackers can use the XXE vulnerability to list the content of directories.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By uploading a crafted XML file with an XML bomb, an attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can access sensitive information like system files, user data, and mounted drives.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can cause the application to become unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through the file upload functionality in the "Config Package Binding" -> "Manage Execution Groups" section. Specifically by uploading a specially crafted XML file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Admin User Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user to access and upload files.
*   **Ability to Upload XML Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a specially crafted XML file.
