Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-30420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue within the Webhook functionality of a-blog cms.
*   It arises from insufficient validation of the URL used in Webhook requests, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal servers or other unintended locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to manipulate the Webhook URL and make requests to arbitrary URLs from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with administrator privileges can potentially access arbitrary files on the server.
*   An attacker can potentially gather information on internal servers not meant for public access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is launched remotely through the web interface of a-blog cms.
*   **Authentication:** Requires the attacker to have administrator-level privileges to access the Webhook configuration settings.
*   **Webhook configuration:** Attackers need to modify the Webhook settings to inject their malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have administrator-level access to the a-blog cms system.
*   The "Hook" feature must be enabled in the a-blog cms configuration (default is disabled).

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   a-blog cms Ver. 3.1.x series versions prior to Ver.3.1.12
    *   a-blog cms Ver. 3.0.x series versions prior to Ver.3.0.32
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable the Webhook functionality via `config.server.php` by setting `define('HOOK_ENABLE', 0);`.
    *   Upgrade to the latest version that includes the fix.
    *   The fix restricts Webhook URLs to only those listed in the `.env` file using `WEBHOOK_WHITE_LIST`.
    *   Response logs are disabled by default, can be enabled in the `.env` file with  `WEBHOOK_RESPONSE_VIEW=enable`.
*   **Workaround:** Disabling webhook feature by setting `define('HOOK_ENABLE', 0);` in config.server.php
