{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setTracerouteCfg` function in TOTOLINK N350RT (V9.3.5u.6139_B20201216) contains a command injection vulnerability. The `command` parameter is passed to a `sprintf` function and then passed to the `dosystem` function. The `dosystem` function then executes the command using the `system` function, which leads to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially gaining a root shell and full control over the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with the `topicurl` set to `setTracerouteCfg` and the `command` parameter containing malicious commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface."
