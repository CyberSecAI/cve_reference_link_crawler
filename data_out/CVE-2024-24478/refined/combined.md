```
The extended option length in RFC 9072 must be stored in
a 16 bit integer to avoid stepping the offset by the wrong
value due to overflow.

# BGP: addition of RFC9072 (BGP open optional paramaeter extension)

## Summary

Current implementation doesn’t support the optional parameters extension in the BGP OPEN messages as per [RFC9072](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9072.html#name-update-to-rfc-4271). This RFC proposes a solution for OPEN message that longer than 255 with backward compatibility.

A patch proposition and merge request will follow

## Sample capture file

The capture joined to the issue contains 3 packets:

* First packet: to check retro-compatibility : non use of the extension, wireshark + patch will keep the classic behavior
* Second packet that use the optional parameter extension: Wireshark + patch will detect it and adapt its dissection to take the extended length
* Third packet with a 0 standard optional parameter length but with the use of extension : Wireshark will ignore the extension.

I tried to keep original behavior as much as possible, I opened to discuss about how to better integrate it in the dissection tree.

Without extension usage:
