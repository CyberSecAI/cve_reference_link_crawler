On Windows a directory returned by tempfile.mkdtemp() would not always have
permissions set to restrict reading and writing to the temporary directory
by other users, instead usually inheriting the correct permissions from the
default location. Alternate configurations or users without a profile
directory may not have the intended permissions.

If you’re not using Windows or haven’t changed the temporary directory
location then you aren’t affected by this vulnerability. On other platforms
the returned directory is consistently readable and writable only by the
current user.

This issue was caused by Python not supporting Unix permissions on Windows.
The fix adds support for Unix “700” for the mkdir function on Windows which
is used by mkdtemp() to ensure the newly created directory has the proper
permissions.

The fix will be made available in CPython versions 3.13.0b1 and 3.12.4.
Backports are pending for other security release streams.
