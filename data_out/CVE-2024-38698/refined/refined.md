- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SKT Skill Bar WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin contains an XSS vulnerability, which allows malicious actors to inject scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will execute when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin. Specifically, it is through the injection of malicious scripts that will then be executed in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious scripts. The required privilege level is "Contributor" suggesting an authenticated user with some level of access to the WordPress site is required.
