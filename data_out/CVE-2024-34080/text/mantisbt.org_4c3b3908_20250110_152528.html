| Summary | 0034434: CVE-2024-34080: Don't hyperlink references to notes whose issues are not accessible to user | | | | |
| Description | If an issue references another issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it doesn't get hyperlinked. If an issue references a private note that the user can't view, then it doesn't get hyperlinked.  However, if an issue references a note that belongs to an issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it gets hyperlinked. Clicking on the link gives an access denied, however, the link, link label, and tooltip are available.  The information disclosed is:   * note author name * note creation timestamp * issue id the note belongs to. * existence of the note. | | | | |

If that is the case, then why are you creating a regular Github pull request, which is publicly accessible ? And is that the reason why you labelled it "refactoring" (it's not)...  Being a security issue, we need a CVE ID for it. This is easily done by opening an Advisory (for future reference: <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/new>), which also gives us the possibility to create a private fork that can be used to work on the patch without disclosing anything until we're ready to publish it.  I have opened [GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q). |
