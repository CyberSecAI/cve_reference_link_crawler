| Summary | 0034434: CVE-2024-34080: Don't hyperlink references to notes whose issues are not accessible to user | | | | |
| Description | If an issue references another issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it doesn't get hyperlinked. If an issue references a private note that the user can't view, then it doesn't get hyperlinked.  However, if an issue references a note that belongs to an issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it gets hyperlinked. Clicking on the link gives an access denied, however, the link, link label, and tooltip are available.  The information disclosed is:   * note author name * note creation timestamp * issue id the note belongs to. * existence of the note. | | | | |

If that is the case, then why are you creating a regular Github pull request, which is publicly accessible ? And is that the reason why you labelled it "refactoring" (it's not)...  Being a security issue, we need a CVE ID for it. This is easily done by opening an Advisory (for future reference: <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/new>), which also gives us the possibility to create a private fork that can be used to work on the patch without disclosing anything until we're ready to publish it.  I have opened [GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/security/advisories/GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q). |

# Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in MantisBT

Moderate

[dregad](/dregad)
published
GHSA-99jc-wqmr-ff2q
May 12, 2024

## Package

composer

mantisbt
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 2.26.2

## Patched versions

2.26.2

## Description

If an issue references a note that belongs to another issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it gets hyperlinked. Clicking on the link gives an access denied error as expected, yet some information remains available via the link, link label, and tooltip.

### Impact

Disclosure of the following information:

* existence of the note
* note author name
* note creation timestamp
* issue id the note belongs to

### Patches

See PR [#2000](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/pull/2000)

### Workarounds

None

### References

<https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=34434>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
