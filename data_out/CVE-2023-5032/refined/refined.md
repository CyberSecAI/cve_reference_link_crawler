Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `/admin/article/article-edit-run.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter, which is user-controlled, is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By successfully injecting SQL code, an attacker can:
    - Access sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control over the database server itself.
    - The provided example demonstrates that the attacker was able to extract the names of databases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/article/article-edit-run.php` endpoint.
- **Manipulated 'id' Parameter:** The 'id' parameter in the POST request is used to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable file (`/admin/article/article-edit-run.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
-   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests, which can be done with tools like Burp Suite.
-   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit example provided shows:
- The attacker modifies the `id` parameter value with a SQL injection payload: `id=0000000002*`. The `*` is used to locate the vulnerability point.
- The sqlmap tool is then used to further exploit the vulnerability. An example of the SQL injection payload is `title=sadawd&categoryid=1&file=&content= wadawd   &id=0000000002" OR (SELECT 1743 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))udQu) AND "BfZx"="BfZx`.
- The tool successfully identifies the SQL injection vulnerability and extracts database information.

**Vulnerable Code Location:**
- File: `/admin/article/article-edit-run.php`
- Parameter: `id`
