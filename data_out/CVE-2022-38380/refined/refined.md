- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control. Read-only users can modify interface settings through the API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284). Read-only users should not have the ability to modify interface configurations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A remote authenticated read-only user can modify the interface settings via the API.  This could potentially lead to unauthorized changes in network configuration, potentially disrupting network services.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via the API, requiring prior authentication as a read-only user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have valid read-only user credentials to the affected FortiOS/FortiSwitchManager device.
