The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's MPTCP implementation related to data re-injection when a subflow is considered stale.

**Root Cause:**
- The MPTCP implementation incorrectly used a TCP-specific helper function `tcp_rtx_and_write_queues_empty()` to check for unacknowledged data in the retransmission queue of an MPTCP socket. This check was intended to avoid unnecessary locking.
- Due to the incorrect helper function, the check always failed.
- A recent TCP change, which reorganized `tcp_sock` fast path variables, exposed the issue by making the check always skip the re-injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect usage of a TCP-specific function (`tcp_rtx_and_write_queues_empty()`) on an MPTCP socket.
- The faulty check prevented proper retransmission of data on stale subflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data loss can occur as the MPTCP stack would not correctly re-inject unacknowledged data from stale subflows.
- This could lead to connectivity issues and unexpected application behavior when a subflow becomes stale.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering a subflow to become stale.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the code path that handles stale subflows when the MPTCP PM detects that a subflow is stale.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to manipulate network conditions to cause an MPTCP subflow to become stale.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send and receive network traffic to the target MPTCP connection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present because of an optimization shortcut and was exposed by a change in the TCP code.
- Fuzzers and static checkers did not detect the issue because the memory accessed belonged to the `mptcp_sock` structure.
- The vulnerability is fixed by removing the incorrect `tcp_rtx_and_write_queues_empty()` check and always re-injecting data, as MPTCP operates on a slow path at that point in the code.
