- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could lead to various impacts depending on the specific actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it, thus performing actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious website containing the crafted request. The attacker does not need any prior access to the WordPress installation.
