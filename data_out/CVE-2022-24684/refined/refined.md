**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Nomad handles the combination of `spread` and `update` stanzas within a job specification. It was found that using these stanzas together in a specific manner could cause a panic in Nomad servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
