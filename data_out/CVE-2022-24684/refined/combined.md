**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2022-04

**Affected Products / Versions:** Nomad and Nomad Enterprise 0.9.0 through 1.0.17, 1.1.11, and 1.2.5; fixed in 1.0.18, 1.1.12, and 1.2.6.

**Publication Date:** February 10, 2022

**Summary**

Nomad and Nomad Enterprise (“Nomad”) allows operators with job-submit capabilities to use the spread stanza in a way such that it can cause panic in Nomad servers. This vulnerability, CVE-2022-24684, was fixed in Nomad 1.0.18, 1.1.12, and 1.2.6.

**Background**

The [spread](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/spread) stanza within a Nomad job allows operators to increase the failure tolerance of their applications by specifying a node attribute that allocations should be spread over.

**Details**

It was observed that Nomad’s spread and update stanzas can be combined in such a way that it can cause panic in Nomad servers. Nomad’s logic has been modified to no longer allow this attack.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Nomad or Nomad Enterprise 1.0.18, 1.1.12, and 1.2.6, or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/upgrade) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by an external party who reported it to HashiCorp.

*We deeply appreciate any effort to coordinate disclosure of security vulnerabilities. For information about security at HashiCorp and the reporting of security vulnerabilities, please see [Security at HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com/security).*
