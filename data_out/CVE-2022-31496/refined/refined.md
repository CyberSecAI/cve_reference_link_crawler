Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-31496:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Broken Access Control issue in LibreHealth's `manage_site_files.php` functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper access control allows any user, including non-admin users, to access and use the super admin functionality for managing site files. This means that the application does not properly verify if a user has the required permissions to access the functionality.
- The `manage_site_files.php` page does not enforce super admin privileges, allowing unauthorized users to modify arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By exploiting the access control vulnerability, an attacker can modify arbitrary files on the server, including PHP files. The attacker can inject malicious PHP code into a file (e.g., `custom_pdf.php`), then execute it by accessing the modified file via a web browser.
- Full control over the server, could potentially lead to data breaches, system compromise, or further attacks on related systems and users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of LibreHealth.
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the vulnerable endpoint `librehealth_host/interface/super/manage_site_files.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the LibreHealth instance.
- The attacker does not need to have super admin privileges but will still be able to use `manage_site_files.php` functionality.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content from nitroteam.kz offers more details than a typical CVE description by including specific vulnerable file paths and the step by step process on how to exploit the vulnerability to achieve RCE.
- It also mentions that the best file to change to achieve RCE without breaking the site is `custom_pdf.php` by injecting PHP web shell code into it.
-  The vulnerability was found during an internship at Nitro Team.
-  The vendor confirmed the vulnerability and permitted publishing of the write up after being notified.
