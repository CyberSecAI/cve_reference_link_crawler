- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper assignment of lookup keys to internal interface contexts in the ACL processing on MPLS interfaces in the ingress direction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Bypass of configured ACLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could bypass the configured ACL and gain access to resources that were supposed to be protected by the ACL.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send traffic through an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send traffic through an affected device.
