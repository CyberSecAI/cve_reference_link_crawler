Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2108:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-2108

**Vulnerability:** Unauthorized AJAX Actions due to Nonce Bypass

**Affected Plugin:** Wbcom Designs â€“ BuddyPress Group Reviews

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.8.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin is vulnerable due to missing capability checks and improper nonce checks in several functions related to AJAX actions for modifying reviews and plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing capability checks:** The plugin does not properly verify if the user has the required permissions to perform certain actions.
*   **Improper nonce checks:** The plugin does not properly validate nonces, which are security tokens intended to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Modify reviews
*   Change plugin settings
*   Potentially perform other malicious actions due to the lack of proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited via AJAX requests, specifically functions that handle review modifications and plugin settings.
*   The absence of proper nonce validation allows attackers to craft malicious requests and execute unauthorized actions if they can trick a user into performing a specific action such as clicking on a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability due to the nonce bypass.
*   The attacker only needs to be able to craft malicious AJAX requests.

**Additional Notes**
* The Wordfence content provides more detail than the official CVE description as it mentions missing capability checks.
* The Wordfence CVSS score is 6.5 but the text from the www.wordfence.com site mentions it as 8.8
