- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `boa` binary of the TRENDNet TEW-820AP router. This occurs when processing the `username` parameter in a POST request to `/boafrm/formWizardPassword`. The value of this parameter is copied into the MIB database with key 182 by the `apmib_set` function, and if the parameter is excessively long, it leads to a buffer overflow when it is later read and used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/boafrm/formWizardPassword` with an oversized `username` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. Typically, this would require being on the same network as the device or having access through a port forwarding rule. The attacker also needs to know the default login credentials to access the web interface.
