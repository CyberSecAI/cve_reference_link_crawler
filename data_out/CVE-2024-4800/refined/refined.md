Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `date_of_birth` parameter within the `submit_student.php` file of the Kashipara Complete Web-Based School Management System. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input within a SQL query without sanitizing it first.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Successful exploitation could lead to the leakage of sensitive data, including user information and system data.
- **System Compromise:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise the system's security. This could include actions like modifying data, creating administrative accounts, or gaining full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is the `date_of_birth` parameter in the `submit_student.php` file via an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to construct a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `date_of_birth=1'+(SELECT 1 AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))v))+'` demonstrates the SQL injection. This payload uses a time-based injection technique which would cause the database to pause for 10 seconds before responding, confirming successful injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Kashipara Complete Web-Based School Management System version â‰¤1.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by user SSL_Seven_Security Lab_WangZhiQiang_XiaoZiLong.
