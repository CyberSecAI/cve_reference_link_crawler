Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `reset_wizard_actions` function in the ThemeGrill Demo Importer plugin was accessible without any authentication or authorization checks. This function was hooked to the `admin_init` action, which executes on both admin pages and AJAX requests (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`), making it accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks in the `reset_wizard_actions` function. This allowed any user, even unauthenticated ones, to trigger the database reset functionality.
*   **Database Reset Functionality Exposed:** The plugin exposed a function that could wipe the entire WordPress database to its default state.
*  **CSRF Vulnerability (in version 1.6.2):** While a patch in version 1.6.2 introduced an authentication check, it lacked CSRF protection. This meant an attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally triggering the reset action via a crafted POST request.
*   **Automatic Login as Admin (conditional):** If a user with the username "admin" existed in the database, the reset function would automatically log in the attacker as that administrator after the reset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Data Loss:** Exploitation could lead to complete loss of website data due to the database being wiped.
*   **Website Reset:** The website would be reset to its default state, including settings, posts, pages, etc.
*   **Full Site Takeover (conditional):** If a user with the username "admin" existed, the attacker could gain administrator access to the site after the database reset.
*  **Malicious actions:** After gaining admin access, the attacker can install malicious plugins or perform any other actions on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:**  Unauthenticated users could directly access `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `do_reset_wordpress` parameter set to trigger the database reset.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** In version 1.6.2, an attacker could use CSRF to trick a logged-in administrator into performing the database reset action by luring them to a website with a malicious form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Users (versions 1.3.4-1.6.1):** No authentication was required to trigger the vulnerability in these versions.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP GET or POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **CSRF attack (version 1.6.2):** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link or to visit a webpage with malicious javascript to trigger the reset action.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability existed for approximately 3 years, from version 1.3.4 onwards.
*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
*   The fix in version 1.6.2 was initially incomplete, lacking CSRF protection. A nonce check was added in version 1.6.3, which addressed the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The affected plugin had a large number of active installations (over 200,000 at the time of discovery), making it a significant risk.
*   The patch for this vulnerability added a `current_user_can('manage_options')` check to the `reset_wizard_actions` method to prevent unauthenticated users and users without sufficient permissions from using the feature.
