Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-23984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "observable discrepancy" in the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface of certain Intel processors. This discrepancy can be exploited to potentially leak information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the potential for unauthorized information disclosure due to the discrepancy in the RAPL interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure. The specific nature of the disclosed information is not detailed, but it is deemed sensitive enough to warrant a firmware update.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system. This indicates that an attacker would need to have some level of access to the machine where the vulnerable processor is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker must be a privileged user on the system. This means they need to have elevated permissions, like administrative rights, to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability has a high attack complexity. This suggests that the exploitation isn't straightforward and requires a level of sophistication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The document lists specific Intel product families and CPU IDs that are affected, including:
    *   3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors
    *   3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family, Intel® Xeon® Processor D Family
    *   4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze processors, including those with Intel vRAN and Xeon W workstation processors
    *   5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors
*   **Mitigation:** Intel is releasing firmware updates to address the vulnerability. Users are advised to apply these updates.
*   **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N for version 3.1, and 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N for version 4.0. These scores indicate that the vulnerability has a moderate severity level.
