```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the `SdcaOptimizer` implementation, which fails to validate if the inputs `dense_features` and `example_state_data` are of rank 2.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is present because the code does not check the rank of the `dense_features` and `example_state_data` inputs. This can lead to a `CHECK` fail and a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to a crash due to the `CHECK` fail. This could be used in a denial-of-service attack if an attacker can control the inputs to the `SdcaOptimizer`.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing inputs with a rank other than 2 for `dense_features` or `example_state_data` to the `SdcaOptimizer`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `SdcaOptimizer` to trigger the vulnerability."
