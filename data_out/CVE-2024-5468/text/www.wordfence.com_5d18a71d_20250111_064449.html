### Description

The WordPress Header Builder Plugin – Pearl plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized site option deletion due to a missing validation and capability checks on the stm\_hb\_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary options that can be used to perform a denial of service attack on a site.
