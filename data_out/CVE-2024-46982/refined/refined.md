{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Next.js handles revalidation for non-dynamic server-side rendered routes in the pages router. Specifically, when a revalidate value is not explicitly returned, the system was defaulting to a minimum revalidate time which was then cached.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of default revalidation values for server-side rendered routes.",
      "Lack of proper validation of revalidate values.",
       "Caching of non-intended routes due to crafted HTTP requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to poison the cache of a non-dynamic server-side rendered route, causing Next.js to cache the route with a `Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate` header. This can lead to unexpected caching behavior in upstream CDNs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request targeting non-dynamic server-side rendered routes in the pages router."
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to a Next.js application."
    ],
    "affected_configurations":[
      "Next.js versions between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9",
      "Usage of pages router with non-dynamic server-side rendered routes",
      "Not applicable for deployments on Vercel"
    ]
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fixes": [
      "The vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7 and v14.2.10 and later by removing the invalid revalidate default fallback."
    ],
    "workarounds": "There are no official workarounds. Upgrading is strongly recommended.",
