# DOS Vulnerability for self-hosted next.js apps using i18n

Moderate

[jescalan](/jescalan)
published
GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x
Jan 28, 2022

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

12.0.0 <= 12.0.8

## Patched versions

12.0.9

## Description

### Impact

Vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone running a Next.js app at version >= 12.0.0, and using i18n functionality.

* **Affected:** All of the following must be true to be affected by this CVE
  + Next.js versions above v12.0.0
  + Using next start or a custom server
  + Using the built-in i18n support
* **Not affected:**
  + Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.

### Patches

A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. We recommend all affected users upgrade as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

We recommend upgrading whether you can reproduce or not although you can ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until you upgrade.

* Open an issue in [next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
* Email us at security@vercel.com

### Severity
