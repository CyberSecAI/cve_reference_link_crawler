# DOS Vulnerability for self-hosted next.js apps using i18n

Moderate

[jescalan](/jescalan)
published
GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x
Jan 28, 2022

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

12.0.0 <= 12.0.8

## Patched versions

12.0.9

## Description

### Impact

Vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone running a Next.js app at version >= 12.0.0, and using i18n functionality.

* **Affected:** All of the following must be true to be affected by this CVE
  + Next.js versions above v12.0.0
  + Using next start or a custom server
  + Using the built-in i18n support
* **Not affected:**
  + Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.

### Patches

A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. We recommend all affected users upgrade as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

We recommend upgrading whether you can reproduce or not although you can ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until you upgrade.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
* Email us at security@vercel.com

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-21721

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

### @ijjk **[ijjk](/ijjk)** commented [Jan 20, 2022](#issue-1109569108)

This ensures we properly 404 when a static asset e.g. `_next/static/` is requested with a locale prefix and adds test cases ensuring we don't regress on this behavior.

since this release

[v12.0.9](/vercel/next.js/tree/v12.0.9)

[`07431d3`](/vercel/next.js/commit/07431d3e0f057a0bd58af6d456e4bee646fd8b42)

**This upgrade is completely backward-compatible and recommended for all users on versions below 12.0.9**

Vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack via the `/${locale}/_next/` route for anyone running a Next.js app at version >= 12.0.0, and using built-in [i18n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) functionality.

## How to Upgrade

* We have released patch versions for both the stable and canary channels of Next.js.
* To upgrade run `npm install next@latest --save`

## Impact

* **Affected:** All of the following must be true to be affected by this CVE
  + Next.js versions between `v12.0.0` and `v12.0.9`
  + Using next start or a custom server
  + Using the built-in i18n support
* **Not affected:**
  + Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.

We recommend everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.

### How to Assess Impact

If your server has seen requests to any route under the prefix `/${locale}/_next/` that have triggered a heap overflow error, this was caused by the patched issue.

## What is Being Done

As Next.js has grown in popularity and usage by enterprises, it has received the attention of security researchers and auditors. We are thankful to our users for their investigation and responsible disclosure of the original bug.

We've landed a patch that ensures this is handled properly so the requested route no longer crashes and triggers a heap overflow.

Regression tests for this attack were added to the [i18n integration test suite](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33503/files#diff-ed73e662e3c049828f92017b8104734e08b868acf10d4d621c44266a72825df6)

* A public CVE was released.
* We encourage responsible disclosure of future reports. Please email us at `security@vercel.com`. We are actively monitoring this mailbox.
