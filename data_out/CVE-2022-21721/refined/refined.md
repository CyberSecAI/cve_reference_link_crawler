{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Next.js handles requests for static assets when i18n routing is enabled. Specifically, it does not properly handle requests for static assets (like those under `_next/static/`) when they are prefixed with a locale (e.g., `/${locale}/_next/`). This leads to a condition where the server can crash due to a heap overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of localized static asset requests leading to a denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "A bad actor can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on Next.js applications that are using i18n functionality, causing the server to crash. This can disrupt service for legitimate users of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted requests to a Next.js server using i18n, targeting static assets with locale prefixes (e.g., `/${locale}/_next/`)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Next.js server that is vulnerable. No special access or privileges are needed beyond being able to send requests to the server."
  },
  "affected_versions": "12.0.0 <= next <= 12.0.8",
  "patched_versions": "12.0.9",
  "workarounds": [
    "Block requests to `/${locale}/_next/` from reaching the Next.js instance until the upgrade is performed."
  ],
  "additional_notes": [
    "Deployments on Vercel (vercel.com) are not affected, nor are similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js.",
    "The fix involves ensuring that the server returns a 404 error when a static asset is requested with a locale prefix, preventing the crash."
