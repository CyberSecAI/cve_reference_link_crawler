SSA-511182: Use of Static TLS Certiﬁcate Known Hard Coded Private
Keys in Adaptec Maxview Application

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.2

SUMMARY

The Adaptec Maxview application shipped with affected SIMATIC IPCs contains a hard coded, non-
unique certiﬁcate to secure HTTPS connections between the browser and the local Maxview conﬁguration
application. A local attacker may use this key to decrypt intercepted local trafﬁc between the browser and
the application and could perform a man-in-the-middle attack in order to modify data in transit.

Adaptec has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Update the default self-signed device X.509 certiﬁcate with an own trusted certiﬁcate

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC IPC (Industrial PC) is the hardware platform for PC-based automation from Siemens.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-23588

The Adaptec Maxview application on affected devices is using a non-unique TLS certiﬁcate across
installations to protect the communication from the local browser to the local application. A local
attacker may use this key to decrypt intercepted local trafﬁc between the browser and the application
and could perform a man-in-the-middle attack in order to modify data in transit.
