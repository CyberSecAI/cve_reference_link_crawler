- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Adaptec Maxview application uses a hard-coded, non-unique TLS certificate across installations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a static, non-unique TLS certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can decrypt intercepted local traffic between the browser and the application, and perform a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data in transit.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to intercept the traffic between the browser and the local application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be local to the affected system, with the ability to intercept network traffic between the browser and the local application.
