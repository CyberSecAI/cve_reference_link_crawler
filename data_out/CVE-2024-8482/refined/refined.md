Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8482

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'url' parameter within the "Team Member" widget of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the 'url' parameter. This allows malicious code to be injected.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the user-supplied input when rendering the page. This allows the injected script to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   These scripts execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected content.
*   This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    *   Potentially gaining further access to the WordPress site if the user has elevated privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the 'url' parameter within the "Team Member" widget.
*   The attacker would need to modify or create a page or post using the Elementor page builder, using the vulnerable "Team Member" widget and supplying a malicious script in the URL field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access. This is necessary to create/edit pages/posts.
*   **Plugin Installed:** The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin must be installed and activated on the target WordPress site.
*  **Elementor Access:** The attacker must have the capability to use the Elementor page builder.

**Affected Versions:** All versions of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin up to and including 1.3.986 are affected.

**Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 1.3.987 and later.
