# Optionally require passing a header to invoke the shutdown endpoint

published
GHSA-6v94-gj6x-jqj7
Jul 15, 2024

## Package

cargo

linkerd-proxy
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< edge-24.6.2

## Patched versions

edge-24.6.2

## Description

### Summary

*Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

When the application is susceptible to SSRF, an attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by making requests to localhost:4191/shutdown.

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

Linkerd could introduce an optional environment variable to control a token that must be passed as a header. Linkerd should reject shutdown requests that do not include this header.

[server.rs](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/blob/46957de49f25fd4661af7b7c52659148f4d6dd27/linkerd/app/admin/src/server.rs)

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

> kubectl port-forward -n 4191
>
> curl -X POST <http://localhost:4191/shutdown>.

Ideally, Linkerd should reject requests if the header is missing.

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
