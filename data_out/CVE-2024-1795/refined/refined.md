Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1795

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation in the "HUSKY – Products Filter for WooCommerce Professional" plugin. Specifically, the `name` parameter within the woof shortcode is not adequately escaped before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information from the WordPress database. This could include user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
- **Data Modification:** Depending on the specific SQL injection, it may also be possible to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Full system compromise:** In some cases, it is possible to gain complete control of the webserver, by leveraging the database to run system commands

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable `name` parameter within the `woof` shortcode. This means an attacker must be able to insert a woof shortcode with a crafted `name` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated to the WordPress site with at least "contributor" level access or higher. This means the attacker needs a valid WordPress user account that has the permission to post content with shortcodes.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof Zając of CERT PL and Bassem Essam.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.3.5.3 of the plugin.
- The patch involved sanitizing the user-supplied parameters by using `esc_sql` and preparing the database queries by using `$wpdb->prepare`.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.3.5.2.
