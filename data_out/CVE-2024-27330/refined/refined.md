- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the parsing of EMF files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious EMF file or visiting a malicious web page containing a malicious EMF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious EMF file to the user or lure the user into visiting a malicious web page. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
