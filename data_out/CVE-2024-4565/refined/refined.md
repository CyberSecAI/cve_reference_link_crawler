{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Advanced Custom Fields plugin allows displaying custom field values via shortcode without proper access control checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Broken Access Control",
      "Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "A contributor-level user can access and view custom field values of any post (including private, password-protected, draft, and trashed posts) or option values by guessing the post ID or option name and specifying them in a shortcode. This leads to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a shortcode with a specified post ID or ACF field option name.",
    "required_capabilities": "A user with 'contributor' role or higher is required. The attacker needs to know/guess a valid post ID or option name.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in both the free and pro versions of the plugin before version 6.3. The shortcode attribute `post_id` can accept 'options' to retrieve option values, not just post IDs."
