```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from an unexpected non-zero initial byte in the encapsulation of a received CDR message when the `m_cdrType` is `DDS_CDR`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a result of an uncaught exception (`BadParamException`) being thrown when processing a malformed serialized data submessage. This lack of proper error handling leads to a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to the application crashing. The confidentiality is low as the malformed messages can be captured. Integrity is not affected as there is no data modification.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, where a specially crafted data submessage can be sent to the PDP (Participant Discovery Protocol) port.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a Fast-DDS participant. No special privileges or user interaction is required."
