- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact varies.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a function where access control is not properly implemented.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user.
