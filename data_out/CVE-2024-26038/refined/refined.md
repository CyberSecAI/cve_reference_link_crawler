{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the application's user interface, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) [CWE-79]"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a user's browser session. An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the browser of a victim user, which could lead to information theft, session hijacking or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker injects malicious scripts through user-supplied input. This input is stored in the application's database or other storage, and then later rendered in the UI. The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses the page with the malicious content.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application (which usually happens via user-accessible input forms).  A low privilege level user can achieve this. The user must then interact with the malicious payload for the XSS to trigger."
