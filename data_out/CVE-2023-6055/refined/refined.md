- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper certificate validation in Bitdefender Total Security's HTTPS scanning functionality. The software fails to check for the "Server Authentication" specification in the Extended Key Usage extension of website certificates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of website certificates by Bitdefender Total Security's HTTPS scanning. Specifically, it does not verify if a certificate has the "Server Authentication" specification in its Extended Key Usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. This enables the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communications between the user and the target website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the target website to conduct the MITM attack. The attack requires physical proximity to the target.
