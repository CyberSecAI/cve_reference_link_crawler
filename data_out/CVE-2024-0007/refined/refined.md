- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Panorama web interface of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS (CWE-79). An authenticated read-write administrator can inject and store a malicious JavaScript payload through the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate another authenticated administrator. This could lead to further unauthorized actions and compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. A malicious actor needs to have administrative access to the Panorama web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have authenticated read-write administrative privileges to the Panorama web interface. The attacker needs to inject the malicious JavaScript through a legitimate interface feature.
