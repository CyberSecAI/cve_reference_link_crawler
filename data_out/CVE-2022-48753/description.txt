In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix memory leak in disk_register_independent_access_ranges

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add()

   If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
   properly clean up the memory associated with the object.

Fix this issue by adding kobject_put().
Callback function blk_ia_ranges_sysfs_release() in kobject_put()
can handle the pointer "iars" properly.
