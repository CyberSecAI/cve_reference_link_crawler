Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Tenda AC18 router firmware version V15.03.05.05 has a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `fromSysToolRestoreSet` function.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** The `fromSysToolRestoreSet` function lacks proper CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to forge a request that can cause a device reset.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the device reboots.

**Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated user, will send a request to the vulnerable `fromSysToolRestoreSet` function, thus triggering a reboot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user of the router to visit a malicious website or click a malicious link.
   - The attacker does not need to be on the same network, as the attack is executed through a cross-site request, although the router must be accessible by the victim's browser.

**Additional Details**
   - The provided proof of concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint. The code uses a `GET` request to `http://192.168.84.101/goform/SysToolRestoreSet` with specific headers and cookies.
   - The PoC is designed to trigger a reboot when sent to the router.
