Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2023-6360

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the 'from' and 'to' parameters within the 'my_calendar_rest_route' function of the My Calendar WordPress plugin. This function is accessible without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database via the vulnerable parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to cause a time-based blind SQL injection, which could lead to exfiltration of sensitive information, alteration of data, or other malicious activities. While the provided CVSS vector only shows Confidentiality impact, SQL injection can often be leveraged to cause integrity or availability impacts as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to a WordPress instance with the vulnerable plugin installed.
- The specific request targets the 'my-calendar' REST route with manipulated 'from' parameter (e.g., `https://WORDPRESS_INSTANCE/?rest_route=/my-calendar=/my-calendar/v1/events&from=1'+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)+AND+'a'%3d'a`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in My Calendar version 3.4.22.
- The Tenable advisory is identified as TRA-2023-40.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.6 (Base), 8.2 (Temporal) with vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
