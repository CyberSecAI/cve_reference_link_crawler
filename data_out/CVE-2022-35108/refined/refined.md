The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in swftools' `pdf2swf` utility, which converts PDF files to SWF format.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Heap buffer overflow:**
    *   **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs within the `draw_stroke` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Incorrect memory management within the stroke drawing functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted PDF file via `pdf2swf`.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to `pdf2swf`.

2.  **Stack buffer overflow:**
    *   **Root cause:** A stack overflow occurs during the parsing of the PDF file, specifically when handling certain objects and string copies. Multiple stack overflows are reported.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate bounds checking or recursion within the PDF parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted PDF file via `pdf2swf`.
    *    **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to `pdf2swf`.

3. **Memory Leak:**
    * **Root cause:** Memory is allocated but not freed during processing of a crafted PDF file.
    * **Weakness**: Improper memory management.
    * **Impact:** Resource exhaustion
    * **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted PDF file via `pdf2swf`.
    * **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to `pdf2swf`.

4. **SEGV (Segmentation Fault):**
    *   **Root cause:** A segmentation fault occurs during the processing of an image stream, specifically within the `DCTStream::getChar()` function, likely due to an invalid memory access.
    *   **Weakness:**  Incorrect handling of image data within the DCT stream processing.
    *   **Impact:**  Causes the application to crash.
    *   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted PDF file via `pdf2swf`.
    *    **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to `pdf2swf`.
