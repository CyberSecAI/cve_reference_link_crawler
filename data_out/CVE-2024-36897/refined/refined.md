The provided content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing case in the DAL (Display Abstraction Layer) when parsing through the BIOS for integrated system information. Specifically, the DAL was missing a case for the new BIOS version 2.3 when extracting the necessary integrated_info, which would lead to a null dereference if Ctx->dc_bios->integrated_info was accessed while NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access `Ctx->dc_bios->integrated_info` without ensuring that `integrated_info` has been properly initialized. When the BIOS version is 2.3, the `integrated_info` could remain NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: A null pointer dereference can lead to a kernel crash and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the system BIOS data related to display. The system needs to have an AMD GPU with a specific VBIOS version (2.3).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, but needs the system to have an AMD GPU with a specific VBIOS version that the DAL parser is not able to handle correctly, resulting in a NULL pointer.
