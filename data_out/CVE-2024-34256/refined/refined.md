- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly uses user-controlled input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. Specifically, the `sql` parameter, which is part of a request to create a new table, is directly used in the SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `create.json` endpoint where the `sql` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization. The code uses pre-compilation objects, but it fails to use placement symbols for parameters in the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This includes the potential to read sensitive data, modify application behavior, or potentially gain control over the underlying database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `admin/system/generate/create.json` endpoint, where the `sql` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the `/Admin/index.html` page and the `create.json` endpoint which requires administrative privileges. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload.
