| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2139911#c0)  Marco Benatto    2022-11-03 19:33:12 UTC  ``` Sudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12, with the crypt() password backend, contains a plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c array-out-of-bounds error that can result in a heap-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by arbitrary local users with access to Sudo by entering a password of seven characters or fewer. The impact could vary depending on the compiler and processor architecture.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2139911#c4)  Marco Benatto    2022-11-04 20:44:10 UTC  ``` Created sudo tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2140224](show_bug.cgi?id=2140224 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2022-43995 sudo: heap-based overflow with very small passwords [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
