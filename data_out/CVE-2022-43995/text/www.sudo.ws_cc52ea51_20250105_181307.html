**[Double free with per-command chroot sudoers rules](/security/advisories/double_free/)**

Feb 27, 2023

A flaw exists in sudo’s per-command chroot feature that could result
in the variable that stores the command being freed more than once.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo versions 1.9.8 through 1.9.13p1 inclusive are affected.
Versions of sudo prior to 1.9.8 are not affected.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2023-27320](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27320)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

**[Sudoedit can edit arbitrary files](/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/)**

Jan 18, 2023

A flaw in exists in sudo’s -e option (aka sudoedit) that allows a
malicious user with *sudoedit* privileges to edit arbitrary files.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo versions 1.8.0 through 1.9.12p1 inclusive are affected.
Versions of sudo prior to 1.8.0 construct the argument vector
differently and are not affected.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2023-22809](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22809)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

**[Buffer overflow in command line unescaping](/security/advisories/unescape_overflow/)**

Jan 26, 2021

A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
*Baron Samedit* by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.

## Sudo versions affected:

Sudo versions 1.7.7 through 1.7.10p9, 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2, and
1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are affected.

**[Symbolic link attack in SELinux-enabled sudoedit](/security/advisories/sudoedit_selinux/)**

Jan 11, 2021

On systems where SELinux is enabled, sudo’s RBAC support allows a
command to be run with a user-specified role and/or type. In order
to transition to the target SELinux security context, `sudo`
runs the command through the `sesh` helper program. When
sudo is invoked as `sudoedit`, `sesh` is used to first
create the editor temporary files with the proper security context
and then, once the editor has run, to copy the edited temporary
files to their original locations.

**[Buffer overflow when pwfeedback is set in sudoers](/security/advisories/pwfeedback/)**

Jan 30, 2020

Sudo’s *pwfeedback* option can be used to provide visual
feedback when the user is inputting their password. For each key
press, an asterisk is printed. This option was added in response
to user confusion over how the standard `Password:` prompt
disables the echoing of key presses. While *pwfeedback* is
not enabled by default in the upstream version of sudo, some systems,
such as Linux Mint and Elementary OS, do enable it in their default
sudoers files.

**[Potential bypass of Runas user restrictions](/security/advisories/minus_1_uid/)**

Oct 14, 2019

When sudo is configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary
user via the `ALL` keyword in a Runas specification, it is possible
to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295.

This can be used by a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run
commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows
root access as long as the `ALL` keyword is listed first in
the Runas specification.

**[Potential file overwrite or tty access on Linux](/security/advisories/linux_tty/)**

May 30, 2017

On Linux systems, sudo parses the `/proc/[pid]/stat` file
to determine the device number of the process’s tty (field 7). The
fields in the file are space-delimited, but it is possible for the
command name (field 2) to include white space (including newline),
which sudo does not account for. A user with sudo privileges can
cause sudo to use a device number of the user’s choosing by creating
a symbolic link from the sudo binary to a name that contains white
space followed by a number.

**[Potential bypass of sudo\_noexec.so on Linux](/security/advisories/noexec_bypass/)**

Oct 26, 2016

A flaw exists in sudo’s *noexec* functionality that may allow
a user with sudo privileges to run additional commands even when
the `NOEXEC` tag has been applied to a command that uses
either the `system()` or `popen()` functions.

## Sudo versions affected:

1.6.8 through 1.8.14p3 inclusive.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2016-7032](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7032)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

**[Potential bypass of sudo\_noexec.so via wordexp()](/security/advisories/noexec_wordexp/)**

Oct 26, 2016

A flaw exists in sudo’s *noexec* functionality that may allow
a user with sudo privileges to run additional commands even when
the `NOEXEC` tag has been applied to a command that uses the
wordexp() function.

## Sudo versions affected:

1.6.8 through 1.8.18 inclusive.

## CVE ID:

This vulnerability has been assigned
[CVE-2016-7076](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-7076)
in the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) database.

**[Arbitrary file access via TZ environment variable](/security/advisories/tz/)**

Feb 9, 2015

Prior to sudo 1.8.12, the `TZ` environment variable was passed through
unchecked. Most libc `tzset()` implementations support passing an
absolute pathname in the time zone to point to an arbitrary,
user-controlled file. This may be used to exploit bugs in the C
library’s `TZ` parser or open files the user would not otherwise have
access to. Arbitrary file access via `TZ` could also be used in a
denial of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will
block.
