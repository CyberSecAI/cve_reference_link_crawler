| |  |  | [westurner](user?id=westurner) [on July 29, 2022](item?id=32281357)   | [parent](item?id=32275687) | [context](context?id=32281357) | [favorite](fave?id=32281357&auth=182d82c0241a8e0424eca71fbd189e7c036593b4) | on: [NIST announces preliminary winners of post-quantum...](item?id=32273327)  From <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31995535> : > *(IDK what the TLS (and FIPS) PQ Algo versioning plans are: 1.4, 2.0?)* Kyber, NTRU, {FIPS-140-3}? | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [cipherboy](user?id=cipherboy) [on July 29, 2022](item?id=32282587)   [–]  Sorry, reading NIST is worse than reading tea leaves and I don't actively participate in the IETF TLS mailing lists enough to say any more than the next person :-) Just stating that the process (NIST to enterprise customer) takes time for complete PQC adoption across the entire stack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [westurner](user?id=westurner) [on July 30, 2022](item?id=32291511)   | [parent](#32282587) [–]  It shouldn't take long to change software: how long does it take to add a dependency on an open implementation and add an optional config file const pending a standardized list of algos like TLS 1.3+ and FIPS, and fallback to non-PQ; like DNSSEC (edit: and WPA2+WPA3)? Do mining rig companies that specialize in ASICs and FPGAs yet offer competitively-priced TLS load balancers -- now with PQ -- or are they still more expensive than mainboards? | | --- | --- | --- | | |
