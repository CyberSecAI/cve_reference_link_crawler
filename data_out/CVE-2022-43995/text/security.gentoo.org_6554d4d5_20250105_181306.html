# sudo: Heap-Based Buffer Overread — GLSA **202211-08**

A vulnerability has been discovered in sudo which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/sudo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.12-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.12-r1** |

### Background

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run commands as other users.

### Description

In certain password input handling, sudo incorrectly assumes the password input is at least nine bytes in size, leading to a heap buffer overread.

### Impact

In the worst case, the heap buffer overread can result in the denial of service of the sudo process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.9.12-r1"

```
