Glibc has supported other hashing algorithms for a very long time and most Linux distros have used them by default for years. I don't think there is a way for an unprivileged user to choose DES if it's not the default, so it's very unlikely this can actually be triggered. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [gunapologist99](user?id=gunapologist99) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470651)   [â€“]  Very good point. And, overriding defaults would mean that you have sufficient knowledge to know what *not* to choose. So, the practical impact of this is virtually nil. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
