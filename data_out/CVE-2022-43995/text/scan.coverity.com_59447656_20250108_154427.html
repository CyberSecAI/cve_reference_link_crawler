### Open Source Defect Density

#### sudo: **160,473** line of code and **0.13** defect density

#### Open Source Defect Density By Project Size

| Line of Code (LOC) | Defect Density |
| --- | --- |
| Less than 100,000 | 0.35 |
| 100,000 to 499,999 | 0.5 |
| 500,000 to 1 million | 0.7 |
| More than 1 million | 0.65 |

**Note:**
Defect density is measured by the number of defects per 1,000 lines of code,
identified by the Coverity platform. The numbers shown above are from our 2013
Coverity Scan Report, which analyzed 250 million lines of open source code.
