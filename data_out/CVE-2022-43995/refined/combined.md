---

uutils coreutils is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils in
[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). While all programs have been implemented, some
options might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.

To install it:

```
cargo install coreutils
~/.cargo/bin/coreutils
```

## Goals

uutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU
are treated as bugs.

uutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same
utils on Linux, Mac, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,
that scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.

## Documentation

uutils has both user and developer documentation available:

* [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)
* [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)

Both can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in
the [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.

## Requirements

* Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
* GNU Make (optional)

### Rust Version

uutils follows Rust's release channels and is tested against stable, beta and
nightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.79.0`.

## Building

There are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or
GNU Make.

> Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo
> and Gnu Make on a Unix platform.

For either method, we first need to fetch the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils
cd coreutils
```

### Cargo

Building uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every
other Rust program:

```
cargo build --release
```

This command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall
(BusyBox-type) binary, named 'coreutils', on most Rust-supported platforms.

Additional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded
sets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it
as a feature:

```
cargo build --release --features macos
# or ...
cargo build --release --features windows
# or ...
cargo build --release --features unix
```

If you don't want to build every utility available on your platform into the
final binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For
example:

```
cargo build --features "base32 cat echo rm" --no-default-features
```

If you don't want to build the multicall binary and would prefer to build the
utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible. Each utility is
contained in its own package within the main repository, named "uu\_UTILNAME". To
build individual utilities, use cargo to build just the specific packages (using
the `--package` [aka `-p`] option). For example:

```
cargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm
```

### GNU Make

Building using `make` is a simple process as well.

To simply build all available utilities:

```
make
```

In release mode:

```
make PROFILE=release
```

To build all but a few of the available utilities:

```
make SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:

```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'
```

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

Likewise, installing can simply be done using:

```
cargo install --path . --locked
```

This command will install uutils into Cargo's *bin* folder (*e.g.*
`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

This does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For
manpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see
`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.

### Install with GNU Make

To install all available utilities:

```
make install
```

To install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:

```
sudo -E make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:

```
make SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:

```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):

```
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:

```
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):

```
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Installing with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities
for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also
be generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.

### Manually install shell completions

The `coreutils` binary can generate completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,
`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells. It prints the result to stdout.

The syntax is:

```
cargo run completion <utility> <shell>
```

So, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to
`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:

```
cargo run completion ls bash > /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls
```

### Manually install manpages

To generate manpages, the syntax is:

```
cargo run manpage <utility>
```

So, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:

```
cargo run manpage ls > /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1
```

## Un-installation

Un-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used
Cargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use
Make to uninstall.

### Uninstall with Cargo

To uninstall uutils:

```
cargo uninstall coreutils
```

### Uninstall with GNU Make

To uninstall all utilities:

```
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:

```
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:

```
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:

```
# DESTDIR is also supported
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

## GNU test suite compatibility

Below is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed
breakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found
[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).

See <https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1> for the main meta bugs
(many are missing).

PLEDGE(2) System
Calls Manual PLEDGE(2)
## [NAME](#NAME)

`pledge` —
restrict system operations

## [SYNOPSIS](#SYNOPSIS)

`#include
<unistd.h>`

int

`pledge`(const
char \*promises, const
char \*execpromises);

## [DESCRIPTION](#DESCRIPTION)

The
[`pledge`](#pledge)()
system call forces the current process into a restricted-service operating
mode. A few subsets are available, roughly described as computation, memory
management, read-write operations on file descriptors, opening of files,
networking (and notably separate, DNS resolution). In general, these modes
were selected by studying the operation of many programs using libc and
other such interfaces, and setting promises or
execpromises.

Use of
[`pledge`](#pledge~2)()
in an application will require at least some study and understanding of the
interfaces called. Subsequent calls to `pledge`() can
reduce the abilities further, but abilities can never be regained.

A process which attempts a restricted operation is killed with an
uncatchable `SIGABRT`, delivering a core file if
possible. A process currently running with pledge has state
‘p’ in [ps(1)](/ps.1) output; a process that was terminated due to a pledge violation
is accounted by [lastcomm(1)](/lastcomm.1) with the ‘P’ flag.

A promises value of "" restricts
the process to the [\_exit(2)](/_exit.2) system call. This can be used for pure computation operating
on memory shared with another process.

Passing `NULL` to
promises or execpromises
specifies to not change the current value.

Some system calls, when allowed, have restrictions applied to
them:

[access(2)](/access.2):
May check for existence of /etc/localtime.
[adjtime(2)](/adjtime.2):
Read-only, for [ntpd(8)](/ntpd.8).
[chmod(2)](/chmod.2),
[fchmod(2)](/fchmod.2),
[fchmodat(2)](/fchmodat.2), [chown(2)](/chown.2), [lchown(2)](/lchown.2), [fchown(2)](/fchown.2), [fchownat(2)](/fchownat.2),
[mkfifo(2)](/mkfifo.2),
and [mknod(2)](/mknod.2):
Setuid/setgid/sticky bits are ignored. The user or group cannot be changed
on a file.
[ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2):
Only the `FIONREAD`,
`FIONBIO`, `FIOCLEX`, and
`FIONCLEX` operations are allowed by default.
Various ioctl requests are allowed against specific file descriptors based
upon the requests `audio`,
`bpf`, `disklabel`,
`drm`, `inet`,
`pf`, `route`,
`wroute`, `tape`,
`tty`, `video`, and
`vmm`.
[mmap(2)](/mmap.2) and [mprotect(2)](/mprotect.2):
[`PROT_EXEC`](#PROT_EXEC)
isn't allowed.
[open(2)](/open.2):
May open /etc/localtime and any files below
/usr/share/zoneinfo.
[profil(2)](/profil.2):
Can only disable profiling.
[`pledge`](#pledge~3)():
Can only reduce permissions for promises and
execpromises.
[sysctl(2)](/sysctl.2):
A small set of read-only operations are allowed, sufficient to support:
[getdomainname(3)](/getdomainname.3),
[gethostname(3)](/gethostname.3),
[getifaddrs(3)](/getifaddrs.3), [uname(3)](/uname.3), and system sensor readings.

The promises argument is specified as a
string, with space separated keywords:

[`stdio`](#stdio)
The following system calls are permitted.
[sendto(2)](/sendto.2) is only permitted if its destination socket address is
`NULL`. As a result, all the expected
functionalities of libc stdio work.

File locking via [fcntl(2)](/fcntl.2), [flock(2)](/flock.2), [lockf(3)](/lockf.3), and [open(2)](/open.2) is allowed. No distinction is made between shared
and exclusive locks. This promise is required for unlock as well as
lock.
[`unix`](#unix)

[`getpw`](#getpw)
This allows read-only opening of files in /etc for
the [getpwnam(3)](/getpwnam.3), [getgrnam(3)](/getgrnam.3),
[getgrouplist(3)](/getgrouplist.3), and
[initgroups(3)](/initgroups.3) family of functions, including lookups via the
[yp(8)](/yp.8) protocol
for YP and LDAP databases.
[`sendfd`](#sendfd)
Allows sending of file descriptors using
[sendmsg(2)](/sendmsg.2). File descriptors referring to directories may not be
passed.
[`recvfd`](#recvfd)
Allows receiving of file descriptors using
[recvmsg(2)](/recvmsg.2). File descriptors referring to directories may not be
passed.
[`tape`](#tape)
Allow `MTIOCGET` and
`MTIOCTOP` operations against tape drives.
[`tty`](#tty)
In addition to allowing read-write operations on
/dev/tty, this opens up a variety of
[ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2)
requests used by tty devices. If `tty` is
accompanied with `rpath`,
[revoke(2)](/revoke.2) is permitted. Otherwise only the following
[ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2)
requests are permitted:

`TIOCSPGRP`,
`TIOCGETA`, `TIOCGPGRP`,
`TIOCGWINSZ`, `TIOCSWINSZ`,
`TIOCSBRK`, `TIOCCDTR`,
`TIOCSETA`, `TIOCSETAW`,
`TIOCSETAF`, `TIOCUCNTL`

[`proc`](#proc)
Allows the following process relationship operations:

[fork(2)](/fork.2), [vfork(2)](/vfork.2), [kill(2)](/kill.2),
[getpriority(2)](/getpriority.2),
[setpriority(2)](/setpriority.2),
[setrlimit(2)](/setrlimit.2),
[setpgid(2)](/setpgid.2), [setsid(2)](/setsid.2)

[`exec`](#exec)
Allows a process to call
[execve(2)](/execve.2). Coupled with the `proc` promise,
this allows a process to fork and execute another program. If
execpromises has been previously set the new program
begins with those promises, unless setuid/setgid bits are set in which
case execution is blocked with `EACCES`. Otherwise
the new program starts running without pledge active, and hopefully makes
a new pledge soon.
[`prot_exec`](#prot_exec)
Allows the use of `PROT_EXEC` with
[mmap(2)](/mmap.2) and
[mprotect(2)](/mprotect.2).
[`settime`](#settime)
Allows the setting of system time, via the
[settimeofday(2)](/settimeofday.2),
[adjtime(2)](/adjtime.2), and
[adjfreq(2)](/adjfreq.2) system calls.
[`ps`](#ps)
Allows enough [sysctl(2)](/sysctl.2) interfaces to allow inspection of processes operating on
the system using programs like [ps(1)](/ps.1).
[`vminfo`](#vminfo)
Allows enough [sysctl(2)](/sysctl.2) interfaces to allow inspection of the system's virtual
memory by programs like [top(1)](/top.1) and
[vmstat(8)](/vmstat.8).
[`id`](#id)
Allows the following system calls which can change the rights of a
process:

[setuid(2)](/setuid.2), [seteuid(2)](/seteuid.2),
[setreuid(2)](/setreuid.2),
[setresuid(2)](/setresuid.2), [setgid(2)](/setgid.2),
[setegid(2)](/setegid.2),
[setregid(2)](/setregid.2),
[setresgid(2)](/setresgid.2),
[setgroups(2)](/setgroups.2),
[setlogin(2)](/setlogin.2),
[setrlimit(2)](/setrlimit.2),
[getpriority(2)](/getpriority.2),
[setpriority(2)](/setpriority.2),
[setrtable(2)](/setrtable.2)

[`pf`](#pf)
Allows a subset of [ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2) operations on the
[pf(4)](/pf.4) device:

`DIOCADDRULE`,
`DIOCGETSTATUS`,
`DIOCNATLOOK`,
`DIOCRADDTABLES`,
`DIOCRCLRADDRS`,
`DIOCRCLRTABLES`,
`DIOCRCLRTSTATS`,
`DIOCRGETTSTATS`,
`DIOCRSETADDRS`,
`DIOCXBEGIN`,
`DIOCXCOMMIT`

[`route`](#route)
Allow inspection of the routing table.
[`wroute`](#wroute)
Allow changes to the routing table.
[`audio`](#audio)
Allows a subset of [ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2) operations on
[audio(4)](/audio.4)
devices (see [sio\_open(3)](/sio_open.3) for more information):

`AUDIO_GETPOS`,
`AUDIO_GETPAR`,
`AUDIO_SETPAR`,
`AUDIO_START`, `AUDIO_STOP`,
`AUDIO_MIXER_DEVINFO`,
`AUDIO_MIXER_READ`,
`AUDIO_MIXER_WRITE`

[`video`](#video)
Allows a subset of [ioctl(2)](/ioctl.2) operations on
[video(4)](/video.4)
devices:

`VIDIOC_DQBUF`,
`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`,
`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS`,
`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES`,
`VIDIOC_G_CTRL`,
`VIDIOC_G_PARM`,
`VIDIOC_QBUF`,
`VIDIOC_QUERYBUF`,
`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP`,
`VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL`,
`VIDIOC_S_CTRL`,
`VIDIOC_S_FMT`,
`VIDIOC_S_PARM`,
`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`,
`VIDIOC_STREAMON`,
`VIDIOC_TRY_FMT`,
`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`

[`bpf`](#bpf)
Allow `BIOCGSTATS` operation for statistics
collection from a [bpf(4)](/bpf.4) device.
[`unveil`](#unveil)
Allow [unveil(2)](/unveil.2) to be called.
[`error`](#error)
Rather than killing the process upon violation, indicate error with
`ENOSYS`.

Also when
[`pledge`](#pledge~4)()
is called with higher promises or
execpromises, those changes will be ignored and
return success. This is useful when a parent enforces
execpromises but an execve'd child has a different
idea.

## [RETURN VALUES](#RETURN_VALUES)

Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned;
otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable
errno is set to indicate the error.

## [ERRORS](#ERRORS)

`pledge`() will fail if:

[[`EFAULT`](#EFAULT)]
promises or execpromises
points outside the process's allocated address space.
[[`EINVAL`](#EINVAL)]
promises is malformed or contains invalid
keywords.
[[`EPERM`](#EPERM)]
This process is attempting to increase permissions.

## [HISTORY](#HISTORY)

The `pledge`() system call first appeared in
OpenBSD 5.9.

## Description

Sudo 1.8.0 through 1.9.12, with the crypt() password backend, contains a plugins/sudoers/auth/passwd.c array-out-of-bounds error that can result in a heap-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by arbitrary local users with access to Sudo by entering a password of seven characters or fewer. The impact could vary depending on the compiler and processor architecture.

[OpenDoas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doas "wikipedia:doas") is a portable version of OpenBSD's doas command, known for being substantially smaller in size compared to [sudo](/title/Sudo "Sudo"). Like *sudo*, *doas* is used to assume the identity of another user on the system.

## Installation

Install the [opendoas](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=opendoas) package.

## Usage

To begin using *doas* as a non-privileged user, it must be properly configured. See <#Configuration>.

To use *doas*, simply prefix a command and its arguments with `doas` and a space:

```
$ doas cmd

```

For example, to use [pacman](/title/Pacman "Pacman"):

```
$ doas pacman -Syu

```

To get to an interactive shell as an other user (omitting `-u user` will default to root):

```
$ doas -su user

```

Logging in as an other user is needed for some commands, see [Sudo#Login shell](/title/Sudo#Login_shell "Sudo").

For more information, see [doas(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/doas.1).

## Configuration

After installing OpenDoas, it will be attached with [PAM](/title/PAM "PAM"), but no default configuration or examples are included.

To allow members of group [wheel](/title/Wheel "Wheel") to run commands as other users, create a configuration file with the following content:

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit setenv {PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin} :wheel

```
**Note:**

* The configuration file must end with a newline.
* The `setenv` option works around an [issue](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/issues/117) arising from OpenDoas's BSD origin where additional system packages are stored under `/usr/local/bin`. In Linux `/usr/local/bin` is generally used to override executables so it comes before `/usr/bin` which contains executables from packages.

The owner and group for `/etc/doas.conf` should both be `0`, file permissions should be set to `0400`:

```
# chown -c root:root /etc/doas.conf
# chmod -c 0400 /etc/doas.conf

```

To check `/etc/doas.conf` for syntax errors, run:

```
# if doas -C /etc/doas.conf; then echo "config ok"; else echo "config error"; fi

```
**Warning:** It is imperative that `/etc/doas.conf` is free of syntax errors!

To allow members of the `plugdev` group to run [smartctl](/title/Smartctl "Smartctl") without password as [Root user](/title/Root_user "Root user"):

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit nopass :plugdev as root cmd /usr/bin/smartctl

```

The general syntax form of `/etc/doas.conf` is:

```
permit|deny [options] identity [as target] [cmd command [args ...]]

```

The last matching rule determines the action taken, so rules must be ordered accordingly.

For more details please read [doas.conf(5)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/doas.conf.5).

## Tips and tricks

### doas persist feature

*doas* provides a persist feature: after the user successfully authenticates, they will not be prompted for a password again for 5 minutes. It is disabled by default, enable it with the `persist` option:

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit persist setenv {PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin} :wheel

```

Executing `doas -L` clears a persisted authentication prior to its automatic timeout.

**Note:** The persist feature is disabled by default, because it is potentially dangerous. In the original *doas*, a kernel API is used to set and clear timeouts. This API is OpenBSD specific and no similar API is available on other operating systems. As a workaround, the persist feature is implemented using timestamp files similar to *sudo*.
### Smooth transition sudo to doas

For a smooth transition from *sudo* to *doas* and to stay downward compatible, you could add to your environment:

```
alias sudo='doas'
alias sudoedit='doas rnano'

```

Or alternatively, symlink *doas* to where *sudo* would normally be (but it does not provide `sudoedit` command):

```
# ln -s $(which doas) /usr/bin/sudo

```

Another way is to install [doas-sudo-shim](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doas-sudo-shim/)AUR, which emulates a couple of sudo's options.

**Note:** By default *sudo* preserves some environment variables while *doas* does not, most notably XAUTHORITY, LANG and LC\_ALL. This means you will not be able to start graphical applications under X nor to access the user's locale without further configuration. For instance, to allow members of the *wheel* group to run graphical applications and to access the user's locale using the setenv option:
```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit setenv { XAUTHORITY LANG LC_ALL } :wheel

```
### Bash tab completion

By default Bash will only tab complete files and directories within the current or referenced directory. To tell Bash to complete arguments as if they were separate commands (also leveraging the tab completion settings of other commands) the following can be added to either the users `.bashrc`, or the global `/etc/bash.bashrc`:

```
~/.bashrc
```
```
complete -cf doas

```

If [bash-completion](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=bash-completion) is installed, the following can be used instead to allow for additional completion of the target command:

```
~/.bashrc
```
```
complete -F _command doas

```

[OpenDoas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doas "wikipedia:doas") is a portable version of OpenBSD's doas command, known for being substantially smaller in size compared to [sudo](/title/Sudo "Sudo"). Like *sudo*, *doas* is used to assume the identity of another user on the system.

## Installation

Install the [opendoas](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=opendoas) package.

## Usage

To begin using *doas* as a non-privileged user, it must be properly configured. See <#Configuration>.

To use *doas*, simply prefix a command and its arguments with `doas` and a space:

```
$ doas cmd

```

For example, to use [pacman](/title/Pacman "Pacman"):

```
$ doas pacman -Syu

```

To get to an interactive shell as an other user (omitting `-u user` will default to root):

```
$ doas -su user

```

Logging in as an other user is needed for some commands, see [Sudo#Login shell](/title/Sudo#Login_shell "Sudo").

For more information, see [doas(1)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/doas.1).

## Configuration

After installing OpenDoas, it will be attached with [PAM](/title/PAM "PAM"), but no default configuration or examples are included.

To allow members of group [wheel](/title/Wheel "Wheel") to run commands as other users, create a configuration file with the following content:

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit setenv {PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin} :wheel

```
**Note:**

* The configuration file must end with a newline.
* The `setenv` option works around an [issue](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/issues/117) arising from OpenDoas's BSD origin where additional system packages are stored under `/usr/local/bin`. In Linux `/usr/local/bin` is generally used to override executables so it comes before `/usr/bin` which contains executables from packages.

The owner and group for `/etc/doas.conf` should both be `0`, file permissions should be set to `0400`:

```
# chown -c root:root /etc/doas.conf
# chmod -c 0400 /etc/doas.conf

```

To check `/etc/doas.conf` for syntax errors, run:

```
# if doas -C /etc/doas.conf; then echo "config ok"; else echo "config error"; fi

```
**Warning:** It is imperative that `/etc/doas.conf` is free of syntax errors!

To allow members of the `plugdev` group to run [smartctl](/title/Smartctl "Smartctl") without password as [Root user](/title/Root_user "Root user"):

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit nopass :plugdev as root cmd /usr/bin/smartctl

```

The general syntax form of `/etc/doas.conf` is:

```
permit|deny [options] identity [as target] [cmd command [args ...]]

```

The last matching rule determines the action taken, so rules must be ordered accordingly.

For more details please read [doas.conf(5)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/doas.conf.5).

## Tips and tricks

### doas persist feature

*doas* provides a persist feature: after the user successfully authenticates, they will not be prompted for a password again for 5 minutes. It is disabled by default, enable it with the `persist` option:

```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit persist setenv {PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin} :wheel

```

Executing `doas -L` clears a persisted authentication prior to its automatic timeout.

**Note:** The persist feature is disabled by default, because it is potentially dangerous. In the original *doas*, a kernel API is used to set and clear timeouts. This API is OpenBSD specific and no similar API is available on other operating systems. As a workaround, the persist feature is implemented using timestamp files similar to *sudo*.
### Smooth transition sudo to doas

For a smooth transition from *sudo* to *doas* and to stay downward compatible, you could add to your environment:

```
alias sudo='doas'
alias sudoedit='doas rnano'

```

Or alternatively, symlink *doas* to where *sudo* would normally be (but it does not provide `sudoedit` command):

```
# ln -s $(which doas) /usr/bin/sudo

```

Another way is to install [doas-sudo-shim](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/doas-sudo-shim/)AUR, which emulates a couple of sudo's options.

**Note:** By default *sudo* preserves some environment variables while *doas* does not, most notably XAUTHORITY, LANG and LC\_ALL. This means you will not be able to start graphical applications under X nor to access the user's locale without further configuration. For instance, to allow members of the *wheel* group to run graphical applications and to access the user's locale using the setenv option:
```
/etc/doas.conf
```
```
permit setenv { XAUTHORITY LANG LC_ALL } :wheel

```
### Bash tab completion

By default Bash will only tab complete files and directories within the current or referenced directory. To tell Bash to complete arguments as if they were separate commands (also leveraging the tab completion settings of other commands) the following can be added to either the users `.bashrc`, or the global `/etc/bash.bashrc`:

```
~/.bashrc
```
```
complete -cf doas

```

If [bash-completion](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=bash-completion) is installed, the following can be used instead to allow for additional completion of the target command:

```
~/.bashrc
```
```
complete -F _command doas

```

# sudo: Heap-Based Buffer Overread — GLSA **202211-08**

A vulnerability has been discovered in sudo which could result in denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/sudo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.12-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.12-r1** |

### Background

sudo allows a system administrator to give users the ability to run commands as other users.

### Description

In certain password input handling, sudo incorrectly assumes the password input is at least nine bytes in size, leading to a heap buffer overread.

### Impact

In the worst case, the heap buffer overread can result in the denial of service of the sudo process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All sudo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/sudo-1.9.12-r1"

```

# Please, a sudo alternative

Delegate accurate least privilege access with ease. Express easily with a regex and expose only what is needed and nothing more. Or validate file edits with `pleaseedit`.

Admin your box without giving users full root shells, most admins have experience of regex in one form or another, so lets configure access that way.

I saw regex but don't like regex. No problem, you can still use please and pleaseedit without regex by using `exact_` counterparts, or treat each field/property as plain text, and escape control characters `?(){}[]+` etc. Most of the regex match statements have `exact` counterparts.

Please is written with memory safe rust. Traditional C memory unsafety is avoided, logic problems may exist but this codebase is relatively small.

# How do I install it

It might already be in the repo that you're using:

[![Packaging status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cce9fbcd45accaa4d2654031b94f5c110774ac6180098cf1518885b634babf26/68747470733a2f2f7265706f6c6f67792e6f72672f62616467652f766572746963616c2d616c6c7265706f732f706c65617365722e737667)](https://repology.org/project/pleaser/versions)

If not, it is a simple install:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/edneville/please.git
cd please
cargo test && cargo build --release \
&& install -o 0 -g 0 -m4755 target/release/please target/release/pleaseedit /usr/local/bin

```

Arch:

```
pacman -Syu git fakeroot devtools binutils gcc rust
git clone https://aur@aur.archlinux.org/pleaser.git
cd pleaser && makepkg -isr

```

Debian/Ubuntu:

```
apt install pleaser

```

Fedora (35):

```
dnf install pleaser

```

NetBSD:

```
pkgin install pleaser

```

SUSE Tumbleweed:

```
zypper install pleaser

```

RHEL 7 (EPEL):

```
yum install cargo git pam-devel
git clone 'https://gitlab.com/edneville/please.git'
cd please/
cargo test && cargo build --release && install -oroot -groot -D -m4755 target/release/please target/release/pleaseedit /usr/local/bin

```

Optionally, set `sudo` as an alias of `please`:

```
alias sudo="please"
alias sudoedit="pleaseedit"

```

Or, if you like, symlink in local:

```
cd /usr/local/bin && ln -s /usr/local/bin/please sudo && ln -s /usr/local/bin/pleaseedit sudoedit

```

# How do I set it up

You may need to configure PAM if you didn't use a distro package in order for `require_pass` to authenticate. Debian-based needs something similar to this in `/etc/pam.d/please` and `/etc/pam.d/pleaseedit`:

```
#%PAM-1.0

# Set up user limits from /etc/security/limits.conf.
session    required   pam_limits.so

@include common-auth
@include common-account
@include common-session-noninteractive

```

Red Hat based needs something similar to this in the same files:

```
#%PAM-1.0
auth       include      system-auth
account    include      system-auth
password   include      system-auth
session    optional     pam_keyinit.so revoke
session    required     pam_limits.so
session    include      system-auth

```

Next, configure your `/etc/please.ini`, replace user names with appropriate values. The `ini` is divided into section options, matches and actions.

## Section options

| Part | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| [section-name] | Section name, shown in list mode |
| include=file | Include file as another ini source, other options will be skipped in this section. |
| includedir=dir | Include dir of `.ini` files as other sources, in ascii sort order other options will be skipped in this section. Files not matching `.ini` will be ignored to allow for editor tmp files. |

`include` and `includedir` will override mandatory arguments.

## Matches

One of the simplest, that does not require password authentication can be defined as follows, assuming the user is `jim`:

The options are as follows:

| Part | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| name=regex | Mandatory, apply configuration to this entity. |
| target=regex | May become these users. |
| rule=regex | This is the command regex for the section, default is ^$ |
| notbefore=YYYYmmdd | The date, or YYYYmmddHHMMSS when this rule becomes effective. |
| notafter=YYYYmmdd | The date, or YYYYmmddHHMMSS when this rule expires. |
| datematch=[Day dd Mon HH:MM:SS UTC YYYY] | regex to match against a date string |
| type=[edit/run/list] | Set the entry type, run = execution, edit = pleaseedit, list = show user rights |
| group=[true/false] | True to signify that name= refers to a group rather than a user. |
| hostname=regex | Hosts where this applies, defaults to 'localhost'. |
| target\_group=regex | When set a group must be provided that matches |
| dir=regex | Permit switching to regex defined directory prior to execution. |
| permit\_env=regex | When combined with `-a`, permit matching environments keys |
| search\_path=string | Change search\_path to `:` separated directory list |

Exact counterparts, which must match exactly. When both regex and exact rules are present, the exact rule match will have precedence.

| Part | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| exact\_name=string | Match this exact name |
| exact\_hostname=string | Match this exact hostname |
| exact\_target=string | Match this exact target user |
| exact\_target\_group=string | Match this exact target group |
| exact\_rule=string | Match this exact rule |
| exact\_dir=string | Match this exact directory |

## Actions

| Part | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| permit=[true/false] | Defaults to true |
| require\_pass=[true/false] | Defaults to true |
| last=[true/false] | When true, stop processing when matched, defaults to false |
| reason=[true/false/regex] | When set, require a reason provided by `-r`, defaults to false |
| timeout=[number] | How long to wait for password input, in whole seconds |
| syslog=[true/false] | Log this activity to syslog, default = true |
| token\_timeout=[number] | How long the authentication token is valid for, in whole seconds |
| env\_assign.key=value | Force environment **key** to be assigned **value** |
| exitcmd=[program] | (pleaseedit) Continue with file replacement if `program` exits 0 |
| editmode=[octal mode/keep] | (pleaseedit) Set destination file mode to `octal mode`, or keep the mode of an existing file. If the file is not present, or mode is not declared, then mode falls back to 0600. If there is a file present, then the mode is read and used just prior to file rename |

Using a greedy `.*` for the regex field will be as good as saying the rule should match any command. In previous releases there was no anchor (`^` and `$`) however, it seems more sensible to follow `find`'s approach and insist that there are anchors around the regex. This avoids `/bin/bash` matching `/home/user/bin/bash`.

If a `include` directive is met, no other entries in the section will be processed. The same goes for `includedir`.

The ordering of rules matters. The last match will win. Set `permit=false` if you wish to exclude something, but this should be very rare as the permit should be against a regex rather than using a positive and then a negative match. A rule of best practice is to avoid a fail open and then try and exclude most of the universe.

For example, using the two entries below:

```
[jim_root_du]
name = jim
target = root
permit = true
rule = ^(/usr)?/bin/du (/home/[a-z0-9-]+\s?)+
require_pass=false

```

```
[jim_postgres]
name = jim
target = postgres
permit = true
rule = /bin/bash
require_pass = false

```

Would permit running `du`, as `/usr/bin/du` or `/bin/du` as `root`:

```
$ please du /home/*

```

And would also permit running a bash shell as `postgres`:

```
$ please -t postgres /bin/bash
postgres$

```

# Date ranges

For large environments it is not unusual for a third party to require access during a short time frame for debugging. To accommodate this there are the `notbefore` and `notafter` time brackets. These can be either `YYYYMMDD` or `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`.

The whole day is considered when using the shorter date form of `YYYYMMDD`.

Many enterprises may wish to permit access to a user for a limited time only, even if that individual is in the role permanently.

# Date matches

Another date type is the `datematch` item, this constrains sections to a regex match against the date string `Day dd Mon HH:MM:SS UTC Year`.

You can permit some a group of users to perform some house keeping on a Monday:

```
[l2_housekeeping]
name = l2users
group = true
target = root
permit = true
rule = /usr/local/housekeeping/tidy_(logs|images|mail)
datematch = ^Mon.*

```

# Default sections

When a matching section name begins with `default` the actions will remain set until overwritten by another matching section. It is important to note that **permit=true** will be set implicitly on matches, therefore, unless there is good reason, set **permit=false** in default sections and **permit=true** in subsequent matching sections. See **please.ini** for further details.

# pleaseedit

`pleaseedit` enables editing of files as another user. Enable editing rather than execution with `type=edit`. The first argument will be passed to `EDITOR`.

By default file permission bits will mirror existing file permissions.

This is performed as follows:

1. user runs edit as `pleaseedit -u root /etc/fstab`
2. `/etc/fstab` is copied to `/tmp/pleaseedit.$USER.r8cYph9h._etc_fstab`
3. user's `EDITOR` is executed against `/tmp/pleaseedit.$USER.r8cYph9h._etc_fstab`
4. if `EDITOR` exits 0, and `exitcmd` exits 0, then `/tmp/pleaseedit.$USER.r8cYph9h._etc_fstab` is copied to `/etc/fstab.llD3wRQB.pleaseedit.copy.$USER`
5. `/etc/fstab.llD3wRQB.pleaseedit.copy.$USER` is set as (target) root owned and `renamed` to `/etc/fstab`

# exitcmd

exitcmd can be used prior to the tmp edit file move to the source location. This can be used to test configuration files are valid prior to renaming in place.

For something similar to apache, consider copying the config tree to a tmp directory before running the test to accommodate includes.

# Other examples

Members of the `audio` group may remove temporary users that an application may not have cleaned up in the form of `username_tmp.<10 random alphanumerics>` using `userdel`:

```
[user_remove_tmp_user]
name = audio
group = true
permit = true
require_pass = false
rule = /usr/sbin/userdel -f -r %{USER}_tmp\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{10}

```

How about, for the purpose of housekeeping, some users may be permitted to destroy zfs snapshots that look roughly like they're date stamped:

```
[user_remove_snapshots]
name = data
group = true
permit = true
require_pass = false
rule = /usr/sbin/zfs destroy storage/photos@\d{8}T\d{6}

```

To list what you may or may not do:

```
$ please -l
You may run the following:
  file: /etc/please.ini
    ed_root_list:root: ^.*$
You may edit the following:
  file: /etc/please.ini
    ed_edit_ini:root: ^/etc/please.ini$

```

The above output shows that I may run anything and may edit the `please.ini` configuration.

Or, perhaps any user who's name starts `admin` may execute `useradd` and `userdel`:

```
[admin_users]
name = admin_\S+
permit = true
require_pass = false
rule = /usr/sbin/user(add -m|del) \S+

```

# Files

/etc/please.ini

# Big installs

For big installs, consider the following:

## Consolidate

Where you can use groups when all member least privilege matches the set. It is best here to consider that people often perform the same role, so try and organise the rules that way, so use either a group or list accounts in a single `name` regex match.

## Central configuration considerations

To avoid single points of failure in a service, `ini` configuration should be generated in a single location and pushed to installs. `ini` files parse very quickly whilst accessing LDAP is not only slower but also error prone.

It could be possible to use caching, but a form of positive (correct match) and negative (incorrect match) would be required. 10,000 computers with hundreds of active users performing lookups against an LDAP server could be problematic.

For these reasons I prefer rsync distribution as the protocol is highly efficient and reduces network transfer overall.

LDAP may at a later date be reconsidered.

## doas - dedicated openbsd application subexecutor

Three days of the *doas*.

I started working on doas quite some time ago after some personal issues with the default *sudo* config. The “safe environment” was under constant revision and I regularly found myself unable to run *pkg\_add* or build a flavored port or whatever because the expected variables were being excised from the environment. If I had been paying attention, keeping *sudoers* up to date probably would not have been such an ordeal, but I don’t like change.

The core of the problem was really that some people like to use sudo to build elaborate sysadmin infrastructures with highly refined sets of permissions and checks and balances. Some people (me) like to use sudo to get a root shell without remembering two passwords. And so there was considerable tension trying to ship a default config that would mostly work with the second group, but not be too permissive for the first group.

Writing a small simple replacement meant that we could ship something in base which was totally unsuitable for the power sysadmin group. It could only work for me, and I would be happy. Meanwhile, those who truly needed all the flexibility of sudo would install it from ports, and they would be happy.

The code was just sitting around in a spare source tree for a while because any “like this, but different” software release immediately results in a flood of email. “It’s different!” And despite my reasoning above, I seemed to be the only person actually unhappy with the situation, so there was no motivation to add the necessary polish to reach minimal replacement level.

Talking with deraadt and millert, however, I wasn’t quite alone. There were some concerns that sudo was too big, running too much code in a privileged process. And there was also pressure to enable even more options, because the feature set shipped in base wasn’t big enough. (As shipped in OpenBSD, the compiled sudo was already five times larger than just about any other setuid program.) Hurray, tension. It wasn’t the problem I was trying to solve, but it was an opening from which to launch my diabolical plan.

First, doas needed a new name because nobody ever likes the first name. A few suggestions were made. sux (already taken by [su, now with more X](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/sux.1.html)). machtfrei (too many letters). powershell (if only). [datass](https://twitter.com/creepingfur/status/621842211903180800) (submitted after contest end).

In to cvs it went as doas. Incidentally, doas appears to be an alternative (mis)spelling for duas, but [the initial commit](http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=143707950008112&w=2) was a few days late for [Laylat al-Qadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laylat_al-Qadr).

And then the real hacking and chopping could begin. I always thought the most important feature of sudo was that it insulted the user after entering a bad password. Apparently the world is filled with poor typists; the first diff to doas was to add a config option *noinsults*. Unfortunately, this was a poor compromise that complicated the grammar and required further documentation, so the feature was dropped entirely. There was also another proposal to change the error message from “Permission denied” to “Sorry” to match *su*, but not implemented. doas will not apologize for your failures.

Deleting a dozen lines of insults made space for one new feature. A simple `-s` option is almost compatible with sudo if muscle memory proves too difficult to overcome.

The config file syntax is crudely inspired by *pf.conf*. Instead of *pass* and *block* keywords, there are *permit* and *deny* keywords. There are some limitations. Trying to deny a single command can be tricky because “ksh” and “/bin/ksh” and “///bin/ksh” are all interpreted differently. Don’t do that. My instinct was that adding deny as a means to counteract permit was a natural idiom; certainly that’s how pf works. In retrospect though, a default pass ruleset already is the default, while permit default is certainly not. The keyword should perhaps be *escalate*. Phrasing it as trying to remove escalation after granting it makes the potential danger more clear.

We’ve been contemplating a different config syntax which reverses the ordering of user and command. Instead of a user focused approach, specify the command first, then the set of permitted users. It should be equivalent in expression, but perhaps the reversed order would encourage users to think about minimal permission grants. I’m not entirely convinced, but I would like it to be at least as natural to express a secure, limited config as a convenient, permissive config.

Coming full circle, the majority of tweaking and polishing of doas now appears to have returned to refinement of the good environment list and the bad environment list. I have built the thing I hate. [At least it’s small](/post/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-less).

The [doas code lives in cvs](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/doas/).

doas was created to run on OpenBSD. I suppose you could port it, but I don’t plan to. Figuring out a replacement for `auth_userokay` is probably the hard part.

Cryptographic attack[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Histogram_of_cross-site_leaks_cache_timing_attack_example.png/400px-Histogram_of_cross-site_leaks_cache_timing_attack_example.png)](/wiki/File%3AHistogram_of_cross-site_leaks_cache_timing_attack_example.png)

An example of a timing attack being performed on the [web cache](/wiki/Web_cache "Web cache"). The graph on the left denotes a case where the timing attack is successfully able to detect a cached image whereas the one on the right is unable to do the same.

In [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), a **timing attack** is a [side-channel attack](/wiki/Side-channel_attack "Side-channel attack") in which the attacker attempts to compromise a [cryptosystem](/wiki/Cryptosystem "Cryptosystem") by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input. Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using [cryptanalysis](/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") of known plaintext, ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to increase the rate of information leakage.[[1]](#cite_note-BearSSL-1)

Information can leak from a system through measurement of the time it takes to respond to certain queries. How much this information can help an attacker depends on many variables: cryptographic system design, the CPU running the system, the algorithms used, assorted implementation details, timing attack countermeasures, the accuracy of the timing measurements, etc. Timing attacks can be applied to any algorithm that has data-dependent timing variation. Removing timing-dependencies is difficult in some algorithms that use low-level operations that frequently exhibit varied execution time.

Timing attacks are often overlooked in the design phase because they are so dependent on the implementation and can be introduced unintentionally with [compiler optimizations](/wiki/Compiler_optimizations "Compiler optimizations"). Avoidance of timing attacks involves design of constant-time functions and careful testing of the final executable code.[[1]](#cite_note-BearSSL-1)

## Avoidance

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Timing_attack&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Avoidance")]

Many cryptographic algorithms can be implemented (or masked by a proxy) in a way that reduces or eliminates data-dependent timing information, a **constant-time algorithm**. An implementation of a constant-time algorithm is sometimes called a **timing-safe implementation**[[2]](#cite_note-2). Consider an implementation in which every call to a subroutine always returns in exactly x seconds, where x is the maximum time it ever takes to execute that routine on every possible authorized input. In such an implementation, the timing of the algorithm is less likely to leak information about the data supplied to that invocation.[[3]](#cite_note-3) The downside of this approach is that the time used for all executions becomes that of the worst-case performance of the function.

The data-dependency of timing may stem from one of the following:[[1]](#cite_note-BearSSL-1)

* Non-local memory access, as the CPU may cache the data. Software run on a CPU with a data cache will exhibit data-dependent timing variations as a result of memory looks into the cache.
* [Conditional jumps](/wiki/Conditional_jump "Conditional jump"). Modern CPUs try to [speculatively execute](/wiki/Speculative_execution "Speculative execution") past jumps by guessing. Guessing wrong (not uncommon with essentially random secret data) entails a measurable large delay as the CPU tries to backtrack. This requires writing [branch-free code](/wiki/Branch_%28computer_science%29#Branch-free_code "Branch (computer science)").
* Some "complicated" mathematical operations, depending on the actual CPU hardware:
  + Integer division is almost always non-constant time. The CPU uses a microcode loop that uses a different code path when either the divisor or the dividend is small.
  + CPUs without a [barrel shifter](/wiki/Barrel_shifter "Barrel shifter") runs shifts and rotations in a loop, one position at a time. As a result, the amount to shift must not be secret.
  + Older CPUs run multiplications in a way similar to division.

## Limitations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Timing_attack&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Limitations")]

Time attacks can also be performed remotely over a network. Observing delays in a system is often influenced by random perturbations, which become even more significant when the observation occurs through a network. In most cases, time attacks require the attacker to have knowledge of the implementation details. However, such attacks can also be leveraged to identify the algorithms in use and facilitate reverse engineering.

## Examples

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Timing_attack&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Examples")]

The execution time for the [square-and-multiply algorithm](/wiki/Square-and-multiply_algorithm "Square-and-multiply algorithm") used in [modular exponentiation](/wiki/Modular_exponentiation "Modular exponentiation") depends linearly on the number of '1' bits in the key. While the number of '1' bits alone is not nearly enough information to make finding the key easy, repeated executions with the same key and different inputs can be used to perform statistical correlation analysis of timing information to recover the key completely, even by a passive attacker. Observed timing measurements often include noise (from such sources as network latency, or disk drive access differences from access to access, and the [error correction](/wiki/Error_correction "Error correction") techniques used to recover from transmission errors). Nevertheless, timing attacks are practical against a number of encryption algorithms, including [RSA](/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29 "RSA (algorithm)"), [ElGamal](/wiki/ElGamal_encryption "ElGamal encryption"), and the [Digital Signature Algorithm](/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm "Digital Signature Algorithm").

In 2003, [Boneh](/wiki/Dan_Boneh "Dan Boneh") and [Brumley](/wiki/David_Brumley "David Brumley") demonstrated a practical network-based timing attack on [SSL](/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer "Secure Sockets Layer")-enabled web servers, based on a different vulnerability having to do with the use of RSA with [Chinese remainder theorem](/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem "Chinese remainder theorem") optimizations. The actual network distance was small in their experiments, but the attack successfully recovered a server private key in a matter of hours. This demonstration led to the widespread deployment and use of [blinding](/wiki/Blinding_%28cryptography%29 "Blinding (cryptography)") techniques in SSL implementations. In this context, blinding is intended to remove correlations between key and encryption time.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

Some versions of [Unix](/wiki/Unix "Unix") use a relatively expensive implementation of the *crypt* library function for hashing an 8-character password into an 11-character string. On older hardware, this computation took a deliberately and measurably long time: as much as two or three seconds in some cases.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*] The *login* program in early versions of Unix executed the crypt function only when the login name was recognized by the system. This leaked information through timing about the validity of the login name, even when the password was incorrect. An attacker could exploit such leaks by first applying [brute-force](/wiki/Brute-force_attack "Brute-force attack") to produce a list of login names known to be valid, then attempt to gain access by combining only these names with a large set of passwords known to be frequently used. Without any information on the validity of login names the time needed to execute such an approach would increase by orders of magnitude, effectively rendering it useless. Later versions of Unix have fixed this leak by always executing the crypt function, regardless of login name validity.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Two otherwise securely isolated processes running on a single system with either [cache memory](/wiki/Cache_memory "Cache memory") or [virtual memory](/wiki/Virtual_memory "Virtual memory") can communicate by deliberately causing [page faults](/wiki/Page_fault "Page fault") and/or [cache misses](/wiki/Cache_miss "Cache miss") in one process, then monitoring the resulting changes in access times from the other. Likewise, if an application is trusted, but its paging/caching is affected by branching logic, it may be possible for a second application to determine the values of the data compared to the branch condition by monitoring access time changes; in extreme examples, this can allow recovery of cryptographic key bits.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)

The 2017 [Meltdown](/wiki/Meltdown_%28security_vulnerability%29 "Meltdown (security vulnerability)") and [Spectre](/wiki/Spectre_%28security_vulnerability%29 "Spectre (security vulnerability)") attacks which forced CPU manufacturers (including Intel, AMD, ARM, and IBM) to redesign their CPUs both rely on timing attacks.[[7]](#cite_note-7) As of early 2018, almost every computer system in the world is affected by Spectre.[[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Timing attacks are difficult to prevent and can often be used to extend other attacks. For example, in 2018, an old attack on RSA was rediscovered in a timing side-channel variant, two decades after the original bug.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

### Algorithm

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Timing_attack&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Algorithm")]

The following [C](/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29 "C (programming language)") code demonstrates a typical insecure string comparison which stops testing as soon as a character doesn't match. For example, when comparing "ABCDE" with "ABxDE" it will return after 3 loop iterations:

```
bool insecureStringCompare(const void *a, const void *b, size_t length) {
  const char *ca = a, *cb = b;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++)
    if (ca[i] != cb[i])
      return false;
  return true;
}

```

By comparison, the following version runs in constant-time by testing all characters and using a [bitwise operation](/wiki/Bitwise_operation "Bitwise operation") to accumulate the result:

```
bool constantTimeStringCompare(const void *a, const void *b, size_t length) {
  const char *ca = a, *cb = b;
  bool result = true;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++)
    result &= ca[i] == cb[i];
  return result;
}

```

In the world of C library functions, the first function is analogous to `memcmp()`, while the latter is analogous to NetBSD's `consttime_memequal()` or[[12]](#cite_note-12) OpenBSD's `timingsafe_bcmp()` and `timingsafe_memcmp`. On other systems, the comparison function from cryptographic libraries like [OpenSSL](/wiki/OpenSSL "OpenSSL") and [libsodium](/wiki/Libsodium "Libsodium") can be used.

## Notes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Timing_attack&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Notes")]

Timing attacks are easier to mount if the adversary knows the internals of the hardware implementation, and even more so, the cryptographic system in use. Since cryptographic security should never depend on the obscurity of either (see [security through obscurity](/wiki/Security_through_obscurity "Security through obscurity"), specifically both Shannon's Maxim and [Kerckhoffs's principle](/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle "Kerckhoffs's principle")), resistance to timing attacks should not either. If nothing else, an exemplar can be purchased and reverse engineered. Timing attacks and other side-channel attacks may also be useful in identifying, or possibly reverse-engineering, a cryptographic algorithm used by some device.

It's easy to exploit and bypasses signature verification on anything using ECDSA in Java, including SAML and JWT (if you're using ECDSA in either). The bug is simple: like a lot of number-theoretic asymmetric cryptography, the core of ECDSA is algebra on large numbers modulo some prime. Algebra in this setting works for the most part like the algebra you learned in 9th grade; in particular, zero times any algebraic expression is zero. An ECDSA signature is a pair of large numbers (r, s) (r is the x-coordinate of a randomly selected curve point based on the infamous ECDSA nonce; s is the signature proof that combines x, the hash of the message, and the secret key). The bug is that Java 15+ ECDSA accepts (0, 0). For the same bug in a simpler setting, just consider finite field Diffie Hellman, where we agree on a generator G and a prime P, Alice's secret key is `a mod P` and her public key is `G^a mod P`; I do the same with B. Our shared secret is `A^b mod P` or `B^a mod P`. If Alice (or a MITM) sends 0 (or 0 mod P) in place of A, then they know what the result is regardless of anything else: it's zero. The same bug recurs in SRP (which is sort of a flavor of DH) and protocols like it (but much worse, because Alice is proving that she knows a key and has an incentive to send zero). The math in ECDSA is more convoluted but not much more; the kernel of ECDSA signature verification is extracting the `r` embedded into `s` and comparing it to the presented `r`; if `r` and `s` are both zero, that comparison will always pass. It is much easier to mess up asymmetric cryptography than it is to mess up most conventional symmetric cryptography, which is a reason to avoid asymmetric cryptography when you don't absolutely need it. This is a devastating bug that probably affects a lot of different stuff. Thoughts and prayers to the Java ecosystem! | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [loup-vaillant](user?id=loup-vaillant) [on April 20, 2022](item?id=31094705)   | [parent](#31091226) | [next](#31101716) [–]  Interestingly, EdDSA (generally known as Ed25519) does not need as many checks as ECDSA, and assuming the public key is valid, an all-zero signature will be rejected with the main checks. All you need to do is verify the following equation: *R = SB - Hash(R || A || M) A* Where *R* and *S* are the two halves of the signature, *A* is the public key, and *M* is the message (and *B* is the curve's base point). If the signature is zero, the equation reduces to *Hash(R || A || M)A = 0*, which is always false with a legitimate public key. And indeed, TweetNaCl does not explicitly check that the signature is not zero. It doesn't need to. *However.* There are still ways to be clever and shoot ourselves in the foot. In particular, there's the temptation to convert the Edwards point to Montgomery, perform the scalar multiplication there, then convert back (doubles the code's speed compared to a naive ladder). Unfortunately, doing that introduces edge cases that weren't there before, that cause the point we get back to be invalid. So invalid in fact that adding it to another point gives us zero half the time or so, causing the verification to succeed even though it should have failed! *(Pro tip: don't bother with that conversion, variable time double scalarmult <https://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/fast-scalarmult> is even faster.)* A pretty subtle error, though with eerily similar consequences. It *looked* like a beginner-nuclear-boyscout error, but my only negligence there was messing with maths I only partially understood. (A pretty big no-no, but I have learned my lesson since.) Now if someone could contact the Whycheproof team and get them to fix their front page so people know they have EdDSA test vectors, that would be great. <https://github.com/google/wycheproof/pull/79> If I had known about those, the whole debacle could have been avoided. Heck, I bet my hat their ECDSA test vectors could have avoided the present Java vulnerability.

If you try random numbers and your prime happens to be close to a power of two, evenly distributed random numbers won't end up outside the [0,n-1] range you are supposed to validate. Even if your prime is far enough from a power of two, you still won't hit zero by chance (and you need to test zero, because you almost certainly need two separate pieces of code to reject the =0 and >=n cases). Another example is Poly1305. When you look at the test vectors from RFC 8439, you notice that some are specially crafted to trigger overflows that random tests wouldn't stumble upon.

We're running some production services on OpenJDK and CentOS and until now there are only two options to be safe: shutdown the services or change the crypto provider to BouncyCastle or something else. The official OpenJDK project lists the planned release date of 17.0.3 as April 19th, still the latest available GA release is 17.0.2 ([https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDKUpdates/JDK+17u](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDKUpdates/JDK%2B17u)). Adoptium have a large banner on their website and until now there is not a single patched release of OpenJDK available from them (<https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/issues/140>). There are no patched packages for CentOS, Debian or openSUSE. The only available version of OpenJDK 17.0.3 I've seen until now seems to be the Archlinux package (<https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/jdk17-openjdk/>). They obviously have their own build. How can it be that this is not more of an issue? I honestly don't get how the release process of something as widely used as OpenJDK can take more than 2 days to provide binary packages for something already fixed in the code. This shouldn't be much more effort than letting the CI do its job.

That's very interesting since they usually only provide out-of-cycle critical fixes for their paid tiers. On the other hand - this only proves that it's actually possible to provide a hot-fixed OpenJDK in time. Unfortunately, I assume that a very common case is just using the distribution provided openjdk-package and configuring the system for auto updates.

As I see it, the distributions are mostly relying on the upstream provisioning of the openJDK project. So if they fix this issue, it shouldn't take long until we see updated packages in all major distributions. This might be a problem specific to the openJDK build process, so a different package source would help in that case. But as mentioned above, Azul usually doesn't provide out-of-cycle critical fixes without a paid plan. And most people will still use whatever the distribution provides - so this is still an issue regardless of alternative package sources. And since I assume that many or most running JDK instances actually are coming from the distributions repository rather than an alternative source, and there is literally no outcry regarding the missing packages whatsoever - I fear that there are a lot of vulnerable software systems of people not knowing about it right now. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gunnarmorling](user?id=gunnarmorling) [on April 21, 2022](item?id=31113926)   | [parent](#31107979) | [prev](#31108301) | [next](#31112060) [–]  For folks on RHEL, the java-17-openjdk package for RHEL 8 has been updated: [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1445](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A1445). > The official OpenJDK project lists the planned release date of 17.0.3 as April 19th, still the latest available GA release is 17.0.2 > ([https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDKUpdates/JDK+17u](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDKUpdates/JDK%2B17u)).

You could compare x509 with revocation to something like oauth with JWT access tokens, though. In that case, x509 certificates are typically expensive to renew and have lifetimes measured in years. Revocation involves clients checking a revocation service. JWT access tokens are cheap to renew and have lifetimes measured in minutes. Revocation involves denying a refresh token when the access token needs renewing. Clients can also choose to renew access tokens much more frequently if a 'revocation server' experience is desirable. Given the spotty history of CRLDP reliability, I think oauth+JWT are doing very well in comparison. I'm pretty damn confident that when I revoke an application in Google or similar it will lose access very quickly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tialaramex](user?id=tialaramex) [on April 21, 2022](item?id=31104750)   | [root](#31101170) | [parent](#31103308) | [next](#31101658) [–]  > x509 certificates are typically expensive to renew and have lifetimes measured in years In the Web PKI thanks to Certificate Transparency we can measure, the typical X509 certificate was issued by ISRG (Let's Encrypt) and thus cost well under one dollar (free to the subscriber, that cost is borne by the donors) and has a lifetime of precisely 90 days. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codebje](user?id=codebje) [on April 21, 2022](item?id=31105384)   | [root](#31101170) | [parent](#31104750) | [next](#31101658) [–]  > In the Web PKI thanks to Certificate Transparency we can measure, the typical X509 certificate was issued by ISRG (Let's Encrypt) and thus cost well under one dollar (free to the subscriber, that cost is borne by the donors) and has a lifetime of precisely 90 days. Yes, it's true that in the past few years Let's Encrypt has substantially altered the typical lifetime of web server certificates, as well as substantially eased the burden of refreshing a certificate in what I would guess to be the majority of use cases. Revocation, however, is still a mess. OCSP services are slow and a privacy leak, and are largely ignored by browsers - in 2021 Firefox was still checking OCSP services but given they're so unreliable if it can't contact a service it assumes the certificate is fine. OCSP winds up being a trade-off between allowing an attacker to conduct a denial of service on all certificates or blocking revocations. In practice the major browser vendors all do more or less the same thing - build their own proprietary list of revoked certificates and distribute it to browsers from time to time, with varying sources and granularity on what they will and won't include in their centralised CRLs. I would have little faith in a timely revocation of a compromised server certificate. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Sirened](user?id=Sirened) [on April 21, 2022](item?id=31105800)   | [root](#31101170) | [parent](#31105384) | [next](#31101658) [–]  Not to mention OCSP stapling provides a revocation escape hatch that allows a certificate to continue to be used even after it has been revoked and the revocation has been streamed to all relevant OCSP servers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nicoburns](user?id=nicoburns) [on April 20, 2022](item?id=31101658)   | [parent](#31101170) | [prev](#31101447) | [next](#31101234) [–]  > Is there any truth to this?

Sure you can use AES-CBC or AES-CTR, and combine it with HMAC or keyed BLAKE2… but as tptaceck pointed out, all authentication methods are going to increase your message size. It's unavoidable: to get authentication you need some redundancy, and the only general way to get that redundancy is to have a message bigger than the plaintext. We do have attempts at length preserving authenticated encryption, but as far as I know they're not as well studied as the classical "encrypt-then-mac" methods such as AES-CBC + HMAC or AES-GCM.

All symmetric crypto algorithms at their basic level that I am aware of do not change the message size at all. If you have an example, that would be helpful. I’m not referring to padding. If you’re referring to IV, then I see what you’re saying, but most algorithms derive that from positional data or treat it like a semi-public part of the key, which I’m not referring to. AES-GCM (as a method) is unusual this way, because it combines encryption and validation at the same time, in each block. They’re two steps - you have the cipher text and the validation data separate. It’s encrypting + signing everything, essentially, for each block. It stores the data for it directly in each block, which is why the inflation. For why this is both great, and terrible depending on the use case - for problem cases, imagine full disk encryption. If you naively encrypt the block using AES-GCM, any block you encrypt will no longer fit in the device. If you encrypt a file (like a database file) which relies on offsets or similar hard coded byte wise locations to data, those no longer work. In both cases you’d need a virtualization layer which would map logical offsets to physical ones. Definitely not impossible. Not as straightforward as replacing your read/write\_blk method with read/write\_encrypted\_blk though. As for why it’s awesome, it greatly simplifies and strengthens the real world process of encrypting or decrypting data where the size of the input and output are not fixed by some hardware constraint or fixed constant, where you have a virtualization layer, or where you don’t need to care as much (or can remap) offsets.

All symmetric crypto algorithms at their basic level that I am aware of do not change the message size at all.* That's because you are not aware of the importance of authentication. Without authentication, your system is not secure: an attacker might intercept messages, and modify them *undetected*. The key word here is "ciphertext malleability". And once they can do that, they can cause the recipient to react in ways it should not, and in some cases the recipient might even leak secrets. Sometimes (like disk encryption) the size overhead is really really *really* inconvenient, and the risk of interception is lower, so you break the rule and skip it anyway. But unless you are in a similar situation (you probably aren't), you must use authentication. It's only professional. In practice, that means you should use authenticated encryption. Authenticated encryption is used *everywhere*, including HTTPS. And yes, it has a small size overhead. Usually 16 bytes per message, like AES-GCM and RFC 8439 (ChaPoly). Per *message*. Not per block. So the actual overhead is very low in practice. And again, it's the price you have to pay to get a secure system. --- Use authenticated encryption. Accept the overhead like everyone else.

Which is exactly what I was referring to? For block based, the best way is simple to use a validating filesystem like ZFS on top of whatever block based crypto is being used, if you need random IO. If you don't, a simple fixed size signature (seperate from the data) is sufficient, and out of band is fine. In either case, including AES-GCM, the validation and authentication is not, itself, the symmetric encryption algorithm. They wrap approved block ciphers which do that. As per the Standard, anyway.

Such as if the data is gone, it may be impossible to figure that out without additional signature or metadata. Without the correct key for AES, it is exceedingly difficult to construct a value that can result in a successful attack after decryption even for the simplest file systems (as compared to a very visible crash or disk corruption issue even without validation), and that blog post way oversimplifies the actual process. It also makes numerous flat out false statements about many encryption modes. a trivial answer that solves every one of the attacks mentioned in that blog is using ZFS on top of a encrypted block device. In each of these cases, for a successful attack, you’d need to generate a new block, or identify an existing block to replace a known block with, that would produce the attackers desired outcome. All GCM does is make it more detectable in the encrypted data if that happens. Some modes mentioned, if watching the actual disk activity and doing chosen plaintext attacks, it could be possible to shorten the time to recover the underlying volume keys, but that is not helped immensely by GCM (necessarily). It is going to be obvious in the system itself without the right key if someone tries to swap in a bogus block, because it will be gibberish/corrupt, if it is data used by anything or checked by anything. AES-GCM just means you can tell when you pick something up, vs when you look at it if it’s damaged. And it does it at the trade off of adding a signature on everything.

Second, what do you mean by "individual blocks"? AES-GCM adds one authentication tag *per message*.

I was specifically referring to the context of things like block devices. There is no single message (in a sane way, anyway) for the device. Each low level block is the message, in the sense you are referring to. That's when inputsize != outputsize is a problem, as that 'message' is also fixed size. When I am referring to authenticating in a way that doesn't make individual blocks bigger, I'm referring to a HMAC signature in filesystem metadata or similar in this type of scenario. Out of band information. Practically speaking, even a basic CRC of metadata and file contents would make most attacks impractical. Which you could do with AES-GCM of course, by storing the tag separately. I currently know of no implementations that do so however, but I'm sure there are ones out there.

And unless you are adding some kind of virtualizing layer, you don’t have .4% of blocks to play with. You have 0% of blocks. I tried to read your pointer, but the link goes no where explaining it. Mind giving a more useful link? It Could be because I’m on mobile. We weren’t talking about CRC of plaintext anyway - we were talking about block encryption. So it would be CRC (as validation) of on-disk filesystem structures as part of parsing. Aka an actual attack. Standard AES-GCM appends the tag to the encrypted message directly. None of those I name do it that way. Using AES-GCM as a transport is layering their stuff inside it, which of course is fine as I’m describing it - because they don’t have fixed size structures in their protocols! It doesn’t mean they aren’t doing the additional validation and authentication. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [loup-vaillant](user?id=loup-vaillant) [on April 22, 2022](item?id=31119214)   | [root](#31101170) | [parent](#31117218) | [next](#31115669) [–]  > *And unless you are adding some kind of virtualizing layer, you don’t have .4% of blocks to play with.

It Could be because I’m on mobile.* The first sentence of the link I gave you reads as follows: *"Some applications may need to store the authentication tag and the encrypted message at different locations."* Then it shows you the following function that achieves that separation (with zero performance overhead I might add): ```   int crypto_aead_aes256gcm_encrypt_detached(       unsigned char       *ciphertext,       unsigned char       *mac,       unsigned long long  *mac_size_p,       const unsigned char *message,       unsigned long long   message_size,       const unsigned char *additional_data,       unsigned long long   additional_data_size,       const unsigned char *always_NULL,       const unsigned char *nonce,       const unsigned char *key);  ``` If *that* does not help you, you need more basic training.

RSA is under increasingly effective attacks, and though elliptic curves are doing very well for now, we have the looming threat of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers. Still, without CRQC there's a good chance that X25519 and Ed25519 won't be broken for decades to come. The other side is the protocol itself. Protocols are delicate, and easy to mess up in catastrophic ways. On the other hand, they're also *provable*. We can devise security reductions that prove that the only way to break the protocol is to break one of its primitives. Such proofs are even mechanically verified with tools like ProVerif and Tamarin. Maybe TLS is a tad too complex to have the same half life as AES. The Noise protocols however have much less room for simplification. That simplicity makes them rock solid. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dynamite-ready](user?id=dynamite-ready) [on April 21, 2022](item?id=31107054)   | [prev](#31101170) | [next](#31107442) [–]  Wonder if someone can add a little more info to the title of this story.

This is the third time this has happened recently in the Java world: the Spring4Shell vulnerability only applies to Java 9 and later (that vulnerability depends on the existence of a method introduced by Java 9, since all older methods were properly blacklisted by Spring), and the Log4Shell vulnerability only applies to log4j 2.x (so if you stayed with log4j 1.x, and didn't explicitly configure it to use a vulnerable appender, you were safe).

You do bring up a nice point about the recent influx of vulnerabilities and problems in the Java ecosystem, which i believe is created by the fact that they're moving ahead at a faster speed and are attempting to introduce new language features to stay relevant and make the language more inviting for more developers. That said, with how many GitHub outages there have been in the past year and how many other pieces of software/services have broken in a variety of ways, i feel like chasing after a more rapid pace of changes and breaking things in the process is an industry wide problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yardstick](user?id=yardstick) [on April 20, 2022](item?id=31098431)   | [root](#31097479) | [parent](#31098117) | [next](#31098476) [–]  > using libraries that haven't been updated since 2012 is a pretty risky move I disagree. Some libraries are just rock solid, well tested and long life. In the case of log4j 1.x vs 2.x, has there been any real motivator to upgrade? There are 2 well known documented vulnerabilities in 1.x that only apply if you use extensions. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KronisLV](user?id=KronisLV) [on April 20, 2022](item?id=31100860)   | [root](#31097479) | [parent](#31098431) | [next](#31098476) [–]  A sibling comment mentions the reload4j project, so clearly someone thought that 1.x wasn't adequate to a degree of creating a new project around maintaining a fork. Can't speak of the project itself, merely the fact that its existence supports the idea that EOL software is something that people would prefer to avoid, even if they decide to maintain a backwards compatible fork themselves, which is great to see. Here's a bit more information about some of the vulnerabilities in 1.x, someone did a nice writeup about it: <https://www.petefreitag.com/item/926.cfm> I've also dealt with 1.x having some issues with data loss, for example, [https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4...](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/DailyRollingFileAppender.html) which is unlikely to get fixed: ```   DailyRollingFileAppender has been observed to exhibit synchronization issues and data loss.  ``` (though at least in regards to that problem, there are alternatives; though for the most part EOL software implies that no further fixes will be available) But at the end of the day none of it really matters: those who don't want to upgrade won't do so, potential issues down the road (or even current ones that they're not aware of) be damned. Similarly, others might have unpatched versions of 2.x running somewhere which somehow haven't been targeted by automated attacks (yet) and might continue to do so while there isn't proper motivation to upgrade, or won't do so until it will be too late. Personally, i dislike the idea of using abandoned software for the most part, when i just want to get things done - i don't have the time to dance around old documentation, dead links, having to figure out workarounds for CVEs versus just using the latest (stable) versions and letting someone else worry about it all down the road. Why take on an additional liability, when most modern tooling and framework integrations (e.g. Spring Boot) will be built around the new stuff anyways? Though thankfully in regards to this particular case slf4j gives you more flexibility, but in general i'd prefer to use supported versions of software. I say that as someone who actually migrated a bunch of old monolithic Spring (not Boot) apps to something more modern when the versions had been EOL for a few years and there were over a hundred CVEs as indicated by automated dependency/package scanning. It took months to do, because previously nobody actually cared to constantly follow the new releases and thus it was more akin to a rewrite rather than an update - absolute pain, especially that JDK 8 to 11 migration was also tacked on, as was containerizing the app due to environmental inconsistencies growing throughout the years to the point where the app would roll over and die and nobody had any idea why (ahh, the joys of working with monoliths, where even logs, JMX and heap dumps don't help you). Of course, after untangling that mess, i'd like to suggest that you should not only constantly update packages (think every week, alongside releases; you should also release often) but also keep the surface area of any individual service small enough that they can be easily replaced/rewritten. Anyways, i'm going off on a tangent here about the greater implications of using EOL stuff long term, but those are my opinions and i simultaneously do admit that there are exceptions to that approach and circumstances vary, of course. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cesarb](user?id=cesarb) [on April 20, 2022](item?id=31098476)   | [root](#31097479) | [parent](#31098117) | [prev](#31098431) | [next](#31097945) [–]  > especially given that if an RCE is discovered now, you'll find yourself without too many options to address it, short of migrating over to the new release Luckily, there's now an alternative: reload4j (<https://reload4j.qos.ch/>) is a maintained fork of log4j 1.x, so if you were one of the many who stayed on the older log4j 1.x (and there were enough of them that there was sufficient demand for that fork to be created), you can just migrate to that fork (which is AFAIK fully backward compatible).

You could argue the very existence and nature of Java object serialization deserves blame as well, but that gets nuanced quickly. Modules are also part of the reason why so many folks got "stuck" on java 8. It is definitely an interesting study in the challenges of trying to make advances in a platform when a lot of the ecosystem is very much in maintenance mode and may not have a lot of eyes on the combination of existing libraries vs new versions of Java. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ragnese](user?id=ragnese) [on April 22, 2022](item?id=31120779)   | [root](#31097479) | [parent](#31110944) | [next](#31101371) [–]  Agreed.

# SlackBuilds Repository

## [15.0](/repository/15.0/) > [System](/repository/15.0/system/) > opendoas (6.8.2)

```
This is the "OpenDoas" port of OpenBSD's doas.

The doas utility is a program originally written for OpenBSD that
allows a user to run a command as though they were another user,
typically root. doas acts as an alternative to sudo, with simple
configuration syntax and a smaller code base for ease of security
auditing.

Please note that running this SlackBuild will install doas with SUID
root.

To get started, write a configuration file at /etc/doas.conf. As an
example, including the line:

  permit :wheel as root

will allow all users in the wheel group to act as root with doas.
Consult the doas.conf(5) man page for further details.

The parameter "keepenv" in /etc/doas.conf allows for opening graphical
applications with doas:

  permit keepenv gene as root

"exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session" may be required for xinit in
Slackware 14.2. An alternative is to run "export $(dbus-launch)" after
starting the X session. As with su, KDE 4 graphical applications may
fail to open with doas.

Running this SlackBuild without parameters will provide a build of
OpenDoas with shadow support if PAM is not installed, and with PAM
support if PAM is installed. Password persistence is disabled by
default.

To enable timestamp-based password persistence, call the SlackBuild
with PERSIST=yes:

  PERSIST=yes ./opendoas.SlackBuild

In addition, ensure that the appropriate user or group line in
/etc/doas.conf includes the "persist" option, as in this example:

  permit persist jane as root

Please note that upstream considers timestamp-based password
persistence to be "new and potentially dangerous."

For users with PAM installed, enable shadow authentication instead by
calling the SlackBuild with PAM=no:

  PAM=no ./opendoas.SlackBuild

If /etc/pam.d/other and /etc/pam.d/system-auth are unmodified from the
state in which they are shipped in -current, doas will run with PAM
support if so compiled. Otherwise, doas may require a dedicated file at
/etc/pam.d/doas to use PAM authentication.

To allow OpenDoas to write a new PAM configuration file for doas, call
the SlackBuild with PAM_FILE=yes:

  PAM_FILE=yes ./opendoas.SlackBuild

Upstream is unlikely to include PAM configuration files in releases of
OpenDoas beyond 6.8.2.

opendoas has no outside dependencies on Slackware 14.2 or 15.0 and
adds no users or groups. opendoas conflicts with all other ports of
doas.

Glibc has supported other hashing algorithms for a very long time and most Linux distros have used them by default for years. I don't think there is a way for an unprivileged user to choose DES if it's not the default, so it's very unlikely this can actually be triggered. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [gunapologist99](user?id=gunapologist99) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470651)   [–]  Very good point. And, overriding defaults would mean that you have sufficient knowledge to know what *not* to choose. So, the practical impact of this is virtually nil. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Estimate of time taken for running an algorithm
"Running time" redirects here. Not to be confused with [Running Time (film)](/wiki/Running_Time_%28film%29 "Running Time (film)").
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Comparison_computational_complexity.svg/220px-Comparison_computational_complexity.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3AComparison_computational_complexity.svg)

Graphs of functions commonly used in the [analysis of algorithms](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms "Analysis of algorithms"), showing the number of operations *N* as the result of input size *n* for each function

In [theoretical computer science](/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science "Theoretical computer science"), the **time complexity** is the [computational complexity](/wiki/Computational_complexity "Computational complexity") that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm"). Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a [constant factor](/wiki/Constant_factor "Constant factor").

Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the [worst-case time complexity](/wiki/Worst-case_complexity "Worst-case complexity"), which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the [average-case complexity](/wiki/Average-case_complexity "Average-case complexity"), which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a [function](/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29 "Function (mathematics)") of the size of the input.[[1]](#cite_note-Sipser-1): 226 Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the [asymptotic behavior](/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis "Asymptotic analysis") of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using [big O notation](/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation"), typically

## Constant time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Constant time")]
"Constant time" redirects here. For programming technique to avoid a timing attack, see [Timing attack § Avoidance](/wiki/Timing_attack#Avoidance "Timing attack").

An algorithm is said to be **constant time** (also written as
O
(
1
)

{\textstyle O(1)}

![{\textstyle O(1)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/55a2cd47ca6554fafc21bbef3331256c7e1631ad) time) if the value of
T
(
n
)

{\textstyle T(n)}

![{\textstyle T(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b5ecab7146650b99bab59b6e97e228de0a4c61a) (the complexity of the algorithm) is bounded by a value that does not depend on the size of the input. For example, accessing any single element in an [array](/wiki/Array_data_structure "Array data structure") takes constant time as only one [operation](/wiki/Instruction_%28computer_science%29 "Instruction (computer science)") has to be performed to locate it. In a similar manner, finding the minimal value in an array sorted in ascending order; it is the first element. However, finding the minimal value in an unordered array is not a constant time operation as scanning over each [element](/wiki/Element_%28math%29 "Element (math)") in the array is needed in order to determine the minimal value. Hence it is a linear time operation, taking
O
(
n
)

{\textstyle O(n)}

![{\textstyle O(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e73234cd485b947e68d1d78823313db65ef226d7) time. If the number of elements is known in advance and does not change, however, such an algorithm can still be said to run in constant time.

Despite the name "constant time", the running time does not have to be independent of the problem size, but an upper bound for the running time has to be independent of the problem size. For example, the task "exchange the values of a and b if necessary so that
a
≤
b

{\textstyle a\leq b}

![{\textstyle a\leq b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80bc3e45cdf18025be4beb90f84cf7b58cfcaf46)" is called constant time even though the time may depend on whether or not it is already true that
a
≤
b

{\textstyle a\leq b}

![{\textstyle a\leq b}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/80bc3e45cdf18025be4beb90f84cf7b58cfcaf46). However, there is some constant t such that the time required is always *at most* t.

## Logarithmic time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Logarithmic time")]

Algorithms taking logarithmic time are commonly found in operations on [binary trees](/wiki/Binary_tree "Binary tree") or when using [binary search](/wiki/Binary_search "Binary search").

An algorithm that must access all elements of its input cannot take logarithmic time, as the time taken for reading an input of size n is of the order of n.

An example of logarithmic time is given by dictionary search. Consider a [dictionary](/wiki/Dictionary_%28data_structure%29 "Dictionary (data structure)") *D* which contains n entries, sorted in [alphabetical order](/wiki/Alphabetical_order "Alphabetical order"). We suppose that, for
1

k
≤
n

{\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq n}

![{\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq n}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/78ec00bc2eb99b403bee93def3c12ae87f1e3c3d), one may access the kth entry of the dictionary in a constant time. Let

D
(

)

{\displaystyle D\left(\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{2}}\right\rfloor \right)}

![{\displaystyle D\left(\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{2}}\right\rfloor \right)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2edee9939c593f103c81f5819e73e1de781e6532), where

{\displaystyle w<D\left(\left\lfloor {\frac {n}{2}}\right\rfloor \right)}

Otherwise, if it comes after the middle word, continue similarly with the right half of the dictionary. This algorithm is similar to the method often used to find an entry in a paper dictionary. As a result, the search space within the dictionary decreases as the algorithm gets closer to the target word.

## Polylogarithmic time

For example, [matrix chain ordering](/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication "Matrix chain multiplication") can be solved in polylogarithmic time on a [parallel random-access machine](/wiki/Parallel_random-access_machine "Parallel random-access machine"),[[7]](#cite_note-7) and [a graph](/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29 "Graph (discrete mathematics)") can be [determined to be planar](/wiki/Planarity_testing "Planarity testing") in a [fully dynamic](/wiki/Dynamic_connectivity "Dynamic connectivity") way in

## Sub-linear time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Sub-linear time")]

An algorithm is said to run in **sub-linear time** (often spelled **sublinear time**) if
T
(
n
)
=
o
(
n
)

{\displaystyle T(n)=o(n)}

![{\displaystyle T(n)=o(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cded9a3b1a3b5dc08a44b03338c5b54821c90a1b). In particular this includes algorithms with the time complexities defined above.

The specific term *sublinear time algorithm* commonly refers to randomized algorithms that sample a small fraction of their inputs and process them efficiently to [approximately](/wiki/Approximation_algorithm "Approximation algorithm") infer properties of the entire instance.[[9]](#cite_note-9) This type of sublinear time algorithm is closely related to [property testing](/wiki/Property_testing "Property testing") and [statistics](/wiki/Statistics "Statistics").

Other settings where algorithms can run in sublinear time include:

* [Parallel algorithms](/wiki/Parallel_algorithm "Parallel algorithm") that have linear or greater total [work](/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms#Definitions "Analysis of parallel algorithms") (allowing them to read the entire input), but sub-linear [depth](/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms#Definitions "Analysis of parallel algorithms").
* Algorithms that have [guaranteed assumptions](/wiki/Promise_problem "Promise problem") on the input structure. An important example are operations on [data structures](/wiki/Data_structures "Data structures"), e.g. [binary search](/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm "Binary search algorithm") in a sorted array.
* Algorithms that search for local structure in the input, for example finding a local minimum in a 1-D array (can be solved in
  O

  )

  {\displaystyle O(\log(n))}

## Linear time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Linear time")]

An algorithm is said to take **linear time**, or
O
(
n
)

{\displaystyle O(n)}

![{\displaystyle O(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34109fe397fdcff370079185bfdb65826cb5565a) time, if its time complexity is

![{\displaystyle O(n)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34109fe397fdcff370079185bfdb65826cb5565a). Informally, this means that the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. More precisely, this means that there is a constant c such that the running time is at most
c
n

{\displaystyle cn}

![{\displaystyle cn}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7f0390269a433e7f1a987b5968c6229e43cd7a2b) for every input of size n. For example, a procedure that adds up all elements of a list requires time proportional to the length of the list, if the adding time is constant, or, at least, bounded by a constant.

Linear time is the best possible time complexity in situations where the algorithm has to sequentially read its entire input. Therefore, much research has been invested into discovering algorithms exhibiting linear time or, at least, nearly linear time. This research includes both software and hardware methods. There are several hardware technologies which exploit [parallelism](/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") to provide this. An example is [content-addressable memory](/wiki/Content-addressable_memory "Content-addressable memory"). This concept of linear time is used in string matching algorithms such as the [Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm](/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm "Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm") and [Ukkonen's algorithm](/wiki/Ukkonen%27s_algorithm "Ukkonen's algorithm").

## Sub-quadratic time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Sub-quadratic time")]

An [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") is said to be **subquadratic time** if
T
(
n
)
=
o
(
n
2

)

{\displaystyle T(n)=o(n^{2})}

![{\displaystyle T(n)=o(n^{2})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b5a1fa201043da51e8f5fcadfc9922764da3408b).

For example, simple, comparison-based [sorting algorithms](/wiki/Sorting_algorithm "Sorting algorithm") are quadratic (e.g. [insertion sort](/wiki/Insertion_sort "Insertion sort")), but more advanced algorithms can be found that are subquadratic (e.g. [shell sort](/wiki/Shell_sort "Shell sort")). No general-purpose sorts run in linear time, but the change from quadratic to sub-quadratic is of great practical importance.

## Polynomial time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Polynomial time")]
Main article: [P (complexity)](/wiki/P_%28complexity%29 "P (complexity)")

An algorithm is said to be of **polynomial time** if its running time is [upper bounded](/wiki/Upper_bound "Upper bound") by a [polynomial](/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") expression in the size of the input for the algorithm, that is, *T*(*n*) = *O*(*n**k*) for some positive constant *k*.[[1]](#cite_note-Sipser-1)[[13]](#cite_note-13) [Problems](/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem") for which a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm exists belong to the [complexity class](/wiki/Complexity_class "Complexity class") **[P](/wiki/P_%28complexity%29 "P (complexity)")**, which is central in the field of [computational complexity theory](/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory "Computational complexity theory"). [Cobham's thesis](/wiki/Cobham%27s_thesis "Cobham's thesis") states that polynomial time is a synonym for "tractable", "feasible", "efficient", or "fast".[[14]](#cite_note-14)

Some examples of polynomial-time algorithms:

* The [selection sort](/wiki/Selection_sort "Selection sort") sorting algorithm on *n* integers performs

  {\displaystyle An^{2}}

  ![{\displaystyle An^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2796e53b94e7bd410c057a6d425c4923ed580156) operations for some constant *A*. Thus it runs in time

* All the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison) can be done in polynomial time.
* [Maximum matchings](/wiki/Maximum_matching "Maximum matching") in [graphs](/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29 "Graph (discrete mathematics)") can be found in polynomial time. In some contexts, especially in [optimization](/wiki/Optimization_%28mathematics%29 "Optimization (mathematics)"), one differentiates between **[strongly polynomial time](/wiki/Strongly-polynomial_time "Strongly-polynomial time")** and **weakly polynomial time** algorithms.

These two concepts are only relevant if the inputs to the algorithms consist of integers.

### Complexity classes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Complexity classes")]

The concept of polynomial time leads to several complexity classes in computational complexity theory. Some important classes defined using polynomial time are the following.

* **[P](/wiki/P_%28complexity%29 "P (complexity)")**: The [complexity class](/wiki/Complexity_class "Complexity class") of [decision problems](/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem") that can be solved on a [deterministic Turing machine](/wiki/Deterministic_Turing_machine "Deterministic Turing machine") in polynomial time
* **[NP](/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29 "NP (complexity)")**: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved on a [non-deterministic Turing machine](/wiki/Non-deterministic_Turing_machine "Non-deterministic Turing machine") in polynomial time
* **[ZPP](/wiki/ZPP_%28complexity%29 "ZPP (complexity)")**: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with zero error on a [probabilistic Turing machine](/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine "Probabilistic Turing machine") in polynomial time
* **[RP](/wiki/RP_%28complexity%29 "RP (complexity)")**: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 1-sided error on a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time.
* **[BPP](/wiki/BPP_%28complexity%29 "BPP (complexity)")**: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 2-sided error on a probabilistic Turing machine in polynomial time
* **[BQP](/wiki/BQP "BQP")**: The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved with 2-sided error on a [quantum Turing machine](/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine "Quantum Turing machine") in polynomial time

P is the smallest time-complexity class on a deterministic machine which is [robust](/wiki/Robustness_%28computer_science%29 "Robustness (computer science)") in terms of machine model changes. (For example, a change from a single-tape Turing machine to a multi-tape machine can lead to a quadratic speedup, but any algorithm that runs in polynomial time under one model also does so on the other.) Any given [abstract machine](/wiki/Abstract_machine "Abstract machine") will have a complexity class corresponding to the problems which can be solved in polynomial time on that machine.

## Superpolynomial time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Superpolynomial time")]

An algorithm is defined to take **superpolynomial time** if *T*(*n*) is not bounded above by any polynomial. Using [little omega notation](/wiki/Big_O_notation#Family_of_Bachmann–Landau_notations "Big O notation"), it is *ω*(*n**c*) time for all constants *c*, where *n* is the input parameter, typically the number of bits in the input.

For example, an algorithm that runs for 2*n* steps on an input of size *n* requires superpolynomial time (more specifically, exponential time).

An algorithm that uses exponential resources is clearly superpolynomial, but some algorithms are only very weakly superpolynomial. For example, the [Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test](/wiki/Adleman%E2%80%93Pomerance%E2%80%93Rumely_primality_test "Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test") runs for *n**O*(log log *n*) time on *n*-bit inputs; this grows faster than any polynomial for large enough *n*, but the input size must become impractically large before it cannot be dominated by a polynomial with small degree.

An algorithm that requires superpolynomial time lies outside the [complexity class](/wiki/Complexity_class "Complexity class") **[P](/wiki/P_%28complexity%29 "P (complexity)")**. [Cobham's thesis](/wiki/Cobham%27s_thesis "Cobham's thesis") posits that these algorithms are impractical, and in many cases they are. Since the [P versus NP problem](/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem "P versus NP problem") is unresolved, it is unknown whether [NP-complete](/wiki/NP-complete "NP-complete") problems require superpolynomial time.

## Quasi-polynomial time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Quasi-polynomial time")]
Main article: [Quasi-polynomial time](/wiki/Quasi-polynomial_time "Quasi-polynomial time")

**Quasi-polynomial time** algorithms are algorithms whose running time exhibits [quasi-polynomial growth](/wiki/Quasi-polynomial_growth "Quasi-polynomial growth"), a type of behavior that may be slower than polynomial time but yet is significantly faster than [exponential time](/wiki/Exponential_time "Exponential time"). The worst case running time of a quasi-polynomial time algorithm is

There are some problems for which we know quasi-polynomial time algorithms, but no polynomial time algorithm is known. Such problems arise in approximation algorithms; a famous example is the directed [Steiner tree problem](/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem "Steiner tree problem"), for which there is a quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithm achieving an approximation factor of

Other computational problems with quasi-polynomial time solutions but no known polynomial time solution include the [planted clique](/wiki/Planted_clique "Planted clique") problem in which the goal is to [find a large clique](/wiki/Clique_problem "Clique problem") in the union of a clique and a [random graph](/wiki/Random_graph "Random graph"). Although quasi-polynomially solvable, it has been conjectured that the planted clique problem has no polynomial time solution; this planted clique conjecture has been used as a [computational hardness assumption](/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption "Computational hardness assumption") to prove the difficulty of several other problems in computational [game theory](/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory"), [property testing](/wiki/Property_testing "Property testing"), and [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning").[[15]](#cite_note-15)

The complexity class **QP** consists of all problems that have quasi-polynomial time algorithms. It can be defined in terms of [DTIME](/wiki/DTIME "DTIME") as follows.[[16]](#cite_note-16)

### Relation to NP-complete problems

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Relation to NP-complete problems")]

In complexity theory, the unsolved [P versus NP](/wiki/P_versus_NP "P versus NP") problem asks if all problems in NP have polynomial-time algorithms. All the best-known algorithms for [NP-complete](/wiki/NP-complete "NP-complete") problems like 3SAT etc. take exponential time. Indeed, it is conjectured for many natural NP-complete problems that they do not have sub-exponential time algorithms. Here "sub-exponential time" is taken to mean the second definition presented below. (On the other hand, many graph problems represented in the natural way by adjacency matrices are solvable in subexponential time simply because the size of the input is the square of the number of vertices.) This conjecture (for the k-SAT problem) is known as the [exponential time hypothesis](/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis "Exponential time hypothesis").[[17]](#cite_note-ETH-17) Since it is conjectured that NP-complete problems do not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms, some inapproximability results in the field of [approximation algorithms](/wiki/Approximation_algorithms "Approximation algorithms") make the assumption that NP-complete problems do not have quasi-polynomial time algorithms. For example, see the known inapproximability results for the [set cover](/wiki/Set_cover "Set cover") problem.

## Sub-exponential time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Sub-exponential time")]

The term **[sub-exponential](/wiki/Infra-exponential "Infra-exponential") time** is used to express that the running time of some algorithm may grow faster than any polynomial but is still significantly smaller than an exponential. In this sense, problems that have sub-exponential time algorithms are somewhat more tractable than those that only have exponential algorithms. The precise definition of "sub-exponential" is not generally agreed upon,[[18]](#cite_note-18) however the two most widely used are below.

### First definition

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: First definition")]

A problem is said to be sub-exponential time solvable if it can be solved in running times whose logarithms grow smaller than any given polynomial. More precisely, a problem is in sub-exponential time if for every *ε* > 0 there exists an algorithm which solves the problem in time *O*(2*n**ε*). The set of all such problems is the complexity class **SUBEXP** which can be defined in terms of [DTIME](/wiki/DTIME "DTIME") as follows.[[6]](#cite_note-bpp-6)[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)

SUBEXP

This notion of sub-exponential is non-uniform in terms of *ε* in the sense that *ε* is not part of the input and each ε may have its own algorithm for the problem.

### Second definition

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Second definition")]

Some authors define sub-exponential time as running times in
2
o
(
n
)

{\displaystyle 2^{o(n)}}

![{\displaystyle 2^{o(n)}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/98ee27d18f582367c1c737ddc1c3380a92c93c0b).[[17]](#cite_note-ETH-17)[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23) This definition allows larger running times than the first definition of sub-exponential time. An example of such a sub-exponential time algorithm is the best-known classical algorithm for integer factorization, the [general number field sieve](/wiki/General_number_field_sieve "General number field sieve"), which runs in time about

Another example was the [graph isomorphism problem](/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem "Graph isomorphism problem"), which the best known algorithm from 1982 to 2016 solved in

However, at [STOC](/wiki/Symposium_on_Theory_of_Computing "Symposium on Theory of Computing") 2016 a quasi-polynomial time algorithm was presented.[[24]](#cite_note-24)

It makes a difference whether the algorithm is allowed to be sub-exponential in the size of the instance, the number of vertices, or the number of edges. In [parameterized complexity](/wiki/Parameterized_complexity "Parameterized complexity"), this difference is made explicit by considering pairs

#### Exponential time hypothesis

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Exponential time hypothesis")]
Main article: [Exponential time hypothesis](/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis "Exponential time hypothesis")

The **exponential time hypothesis** (**ETH**) is that [3SAT](/wiki/3SAT "3SAT"), the satisfiability problem of Boolean formulas in [conjunctive normal form](/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form "Conjunctive normal form") with at most three literals per clause and with *n* variables, cannot be solved in time 2*o*(*n*). More precisely, the hypothesis is that there is some absolute constant *c* > 0 such that 3SAT cannot be decided in time 2*cn* by any deterministic Turing machine. With *m* denoting the number of clauses, ETH is equivalent to the hypothesis that *k*SAT cannot be solved in time 2*o*(*m*) for any integer *k* ≥ 3.[[26]](#cite_note-26) The exponential time hypothesis implies [P ≠ NP](/wiki/P_%E2%89%A0_NP "P ≠ NP").

## Exponential time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Exponential time")]

An algorithm is said to be **exponential time**, if *T*(*n*) is upper bounded by 2poly(*n*), where poly(*n*) is some polynomial in *n*. More formally, an algorithm is exponential time if *T*(*n*) is bounded by *O*(2*n**k*) for some constant *k*. Problems which admit exponential time algorithms on a deterministic Turing machine form the complexity class known as **[EXP](/wiki/EXP "EXP")**.

EXP

=
⋃
c
∈
R
+

DTIME

(
2
n
c

)

{\displaystyle {\text{EXP}}=\bigcup \_{c\in \mathbb {R\_{+}} }{\text{DTIME}}\left(2^{n^{c}}\right)}

Sometimes, exponential time is used to refer to algorithms that have *T*(*n*) = 2*O*(*n*), where the exponent is at most a linear function of *n*. This gives rise to the complexity class **[E](/wiki/E_%28complexity%29 "E (complexity)")**.

## Factorial time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Factorial time")]

An algorithm is said to be **factorial time** if *T(n)* is upper bounded by the [factorial function](/wiki/Factorial_function "Factorial function") *n!*. Factorial time is a subset of exponential time (EXP) because

An example of an algorithm that runs in factorial time is [bogosort](/wiki/Bogosort "Bogosort"), a notoriously inefficient sorting algorithm based on [trial and error](/wiki/Trial_and_error "Trial and error"). Bogosort sorts a list of *n* items by repeatedly [shuffling](/wiki/Shuffling "Shuffling") the list until it is found to be sorted. In the average case, each pass through the bogosort algorithm will examine one of the *n*! orderings of the *n* items. If the items are distinct, only one such ordering is sorted. Bogosort shares patrimony with the [infinite monkey theorem](/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem "Infinite monkey theorem").

## Double exponential time

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Time_complexity&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Double exponential time")]

An algorithm is said to be [double exponential](/wiki/Double_exponential_function "Double exponential function") time if *T*(*n*) is upper bounded by 22poly(*n*), where poly(*n*) is some polynomial in *n*. Such algorithms belong to the complexity class [2-EXPTIME](/wiki/2-EXPTIME "2-EXPTIME").

2-EXPTIME

Well-known double exponential time algorithms include:

* Decision procedures for [Presburger arithmetic](/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic "Presburger arithmetic")
* Computing a [Gröbner basis](/wiki/Gr%C3%B6bner_basis "Gröbner basis") (in the worst case[[27]](#cite_note-27))
* [Quantifier elimination](/wiki/Quantifier_elimination "Quantifier elimination") on [real closed fields](/wiki/Real_closed_field "Real closed field") takes at least double exponential time,[[28]](#cite_note-28) and can be done in this time.[[29]](#cite_note-29)

In [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"), **Triple DES** (**3DES** or **TDES**), officially the **Triple Data Encryption Algorithm** (**TDEA** or **Triple DEA**), is a [symmetric-key](/wiki/Symmetric-key "Symmetric-key") [block cipher](/wiki/Block_cipher "Block cipher"), which applies the [DES](/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard") cipher algorithm three times to each data block. The 56-bit key of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) is no longer considered adequate in the face of modern cryptanalytic techniques and supercomputing power; Triple DES increases the effective security to 112 bits. A [CVE](/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures") released in 2016, *[CVE-2016-2183](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2183)*, disclosed a major security vulnerability in the DES and 3DES encryption algorithms. This CVE, combined with the inadequate key size of 3DES, led to [NIST](/wiki/NIST "NIST") deprecating 3DES in 2019 and disallowing all uses (except processing already encrypted data) by the end of 2023.[[1]](#cite_note-1) It has been replaced with the more secure, more robust [AES](/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard").

While US government and industry standards abbreviate the algorithm's name as TDES (Triple DES) and TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm),[[2]](#cite_note-2) RFC 1851 referred to it as 3DES from the time it first promulgated the idea, and this namesake has since come into wide use by most vendors, users, and cryptographers.[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

In 1978, a triple encryption method using DES with two 56-bit keys was proposed by [Walter Tuchman](/wiki/Walter_Tuchman "Walter Tuchman"); in 1981, [Merkle](/wiki/Ralph_Merkle "Ralph Merkle") and [Hellman](/wiki/Martin_Hellman "Martin Hellman") proposed a more secure triple-key version of 3DES with 112 bits of security.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Standards

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Standards")]

The Triple Data Encryption Algorithm is variously defined in several standards documents:

* [RFC](/wiki/Request_for_Comments "Request for Comments") 1851, *The ESP Triple DES Transform*[[8]](#cite_note-8) (approved in 1995)
* [ANSI](/wiki/ANSI "ANSI") ANS X9.52-1998 *Triple Data Encryption Algorithm Modes of Operation*[[9]](#cite_note-ANSIx952-9) (approved in 1998, withdrawn in 2008[[10]](#cite_note-10))
* [FIPS](/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards "Federal Information Processing Standards") PUB 46-3 *Data Encryption Standard (DES)*[[11]](#cite_note-11) (approved in 1999, withdrawn in 2005[[12]](#cite_note-12))
* [NIST](/wiki/NIST "NIST") Special Publication 800-67 Revision 2 *Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher*[[13]](#cite_note-NIST67r2-13) (approved in 2017, withdrawn in 2024[[14]](#cite_note-14))
* [ISO](/wiki/ISO "ISO")/[IEC](/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") 18033-3:2010: Part 3: Block ciphers[[15]](#cite_note-15) (approved in 2005)

## Algorithm

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Algorithm")]

The original DES cipher's [key size](/wiki/Key_size "Key size") of 56 bits was considered generally sufficient when it was designed, but the availability of increasing computational power made [brute-force attacks](/wiki/Brute-force_attack "Brute-force attack") feasible. Triple DES provides a relatively simple method of increasing the key size of DES to protect against such attacks, without the need to design a completely new block cipher algorithm.

A naive approach to increase the strength of a block encryption algorithm with a short key length (like DES) would be to use two keys
(
K

,
K

)

{\displaystyle (K1,K2)}

![{\displaystyle (K1,K2)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/49ae93d35f6c18bcbe1b89de9c604ac3e66fdeba) instead of one, and encrypt each block twice:

Unfortunately, this approach is vulnerable to the [meet-in-the-middle attack](/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack "Meet-in-the-middle attack"): given a [known plaintext](/wiki/Known_plaintext "Known plaintext") pair
(
x

Each triple encryption encrypts one [block](/wiki/Block_size_%28cryptography%29 "Block size (cryptography)") of 64 bits of data.

In each case, the middle operation is the reverse of the first and last. This improves the strength of the algorithm when using [keying option](#Keying_options) 2 and provides [backward compatibility](/wiki/Backward_compatibility "Backward compatibility") with DES with keying option 3.

## Keying options

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Keying options")]

The standards define three keying options:

Keying option 1
All three keys are independent. Sometimes known as 3TDEA[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16) or triple-length keys.[[17]](#cite_note-cryptography_world-17)

This is the strongest, with 3 × 56 = 168 independent key bits. It is still vulnerable to the [meet-in-the-middle attack](/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack "Meet-in-the-middle attack"), but the attack requires 22 × 56 steps.

Keying option 2
K1 and K2 are independent, and K3 = K1. Sometimes known as 2TDEA[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16) or double-length keys.[[17]](#cite_note-cryptography_world-17)

This provides a shorter key length of 56\*2 or 112 bits and a reasonable compromise between DES and keying option 1, with the same caveat as above.[[18]](#cite_note-18) This is an improvement over "double DES" which only requires 256 steps to attack. NIST disallowed this option in 2015.[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16)

Keying option 3
All three keys are identical, i.e. K1 = K2 = K3.

This is backward-compatible with DES, since two of the operations cancel out. ISO/IEC 18033-3 never allowed this option, and NIST no longer allows K1 = K2 or K2 = K3.[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16)[[13]](#cite_note-NIST67r2-13)

Each DES key is 8 [odd-parity](/wiki/Odd_parity "Odd parity") bytes, with 56 bits of key and 8 bits of error-detection.[[9]](#cite_note-ANSIx952-9) A key bundle requires 24 bytes for option 1, 16 for option 2, or 8 for option 3.

NIST (and the current TCG specifications version 2.0 of approved algorithms for [Trusted Platform Module](/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module "Trusted Platform Module")) also disallows using any one of the 64 following 64-bit values in any keys (note that 32 of them are the binary complement of the 32 others; and that 32 of these keys are also the reverse permutation of bytes of the 32 others), listed here in hexadecimal (in each byte, the least significant bit is an odd-parity generated bit, which is discarded when forming the effectively 56-bit key):

```

With these restrictions on allowed keys, Triple DES was reapproved with keying options 1 and 2 only. Generally, the three keys are generated by taking 24 bytes from a strong random generator, and only keying option 1 should be used (option 2 needs only 16 random bytes, but strong random generators are hard to assert and it is considered best practice to use only option 1).

## Encryption of more than one block

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Encryption of more than one block")]

As with all block ciphers, encryption and decryption of multiple blocks of data may be performed using a variety of [modes of operation](/wiki/Modes_of_operation "Modes of operation"), which can generally be defined independently of the block cipher algorithm. However, ANS X9.52 specifies directly, and NIST SP 800-67 specifies via SP 800-38A,[[19]](#cite_note-19) that some modes shall only be used with certain constraints on them that do not necessarily apply to general specifications of those modes. For example, ANS X9.52 specifies that for [cipher block chaining](/wiki/Cipher_block_chaining "Cipher block chaining"), the [initialization vector](/wiki/Initialization_vector "Initialization vector") shall be different each time, whereas ISO/IEC 10116[[20]](#cite_note-20) does not. FIPS PUB 46-3 and ISO/IEC 18033-3 define only the single-block algorithm, and do not place any restrictions on the modes of operation for multiple blocks.

## Security

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Security")]

In general, Triple DES with three independent keys ([keying option](#Keying_options) 1) has a key length of 168 bits (three 56-bit DES keys), but due to the [meet-in-the-middle attack](/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack "Meet-in-the-middle attack"), the effective security it provides is only 112 bits.[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16) Keying option 2 reduces the effective key size to 112 bits (because the third key is the same as the first). However, this option is susceptible to certain [chosen-plaintext](/wiki/Chosen-plaintext "Chosen-plaintext") or [known-plaintext](/wiki/Known-plaintext "Known-plaintext") attacks,[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22) and thus it is designated by NIST to have only 80 [bits of security](/wiki/Bits_of_security "Bits of security").[[16]](#cite_note-NIST57r4-16) This can be considered insecure; as a consequence, Triple DES's planned deprecation was announced by NIST in 2017.[[23]](#cite_note-tdea-deprecation-23)

Logo of the Sweet32 attack

The short block size of 64 bits makes 3DES vulnerable to block collision attacks if it is used to encrypt large amounts of data with the same key. The Sweet32 attack shows how this can be exploited in TLS and OpenVPN.[[24]](#cite_note-24) Practical Sweet32 attack on 3DES-based cipher-suites in TLS required

[OpenSSL](/wiki/OpenSSL "OpenSSL") does not include 3DES by default since version 1.1.0 (August 2016) and considers it a "weak cipher".[[25]](#cite_note-25)

## Usage

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Triple_DES&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Usage")]

As of 2008, the [electronic payment](/wiki/Electronic_payment "Electronic payment") industry uses Triple DES and continues to develop and promulgate standards based upon it, such as [EMV](/wiki/EMV "EMV").[[26]](#cite_note-26)

Earlier versions of [Microsoft OneNote](/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote "Microsoft OneNote"),[[27]](#cite_note-27) [Microsoft Outlook](/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook "Microsoft Outlook") 2007[[28]](#cite_note-28) and Microsoft [System Center Configuration Manager](/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Manager "System Center Configuration Manager") 2012[[29]](#cite_note-29) use Triple DES to password-protect user content and system data. However, in December 2018, Microsoft announced the retirement of 3DES throughout their Office 365 service.[[30]](#cite_note-30)

[Firefox](/wiki/Firefox "Firefox") and [Mozilla Thunderbird](/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird "Mozilla Thunderbird") use Triple DES in [CBC mode](/wiki/CBC_mode "CBC mode") to encrypt website authentication login credentials when using a master password.[[31]](#cite_note-31)

## The sudo philosophy

Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges
to users and log root activity. The basic philosophy is to give as few
privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

## Where to find sudo

Before building sudo, make sure you have the current version. The
latest sudo may always be gotten via anonymous ftp from ftp.sudo.ws
in the directory /pub/sudo/ or from the sudo web site, <https://www.sudo.ws/>

The distribution is sudo-M.m.tar.gz where *M* is the major version
number and *m* is the minor version number. Beta versions of sudo may
also be available. If you join the *sudo-workers* mailing list you
will get the beta announcements (see the Mailing lists section below).

## What's new

See the NEWS file for a list of major changes in this release. For
a complete list of changes, see the [ChangeLog](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/ChangeLog).
For a summary of major changes to the current stable release, see
<https://www.sudo.ws/releases/stable/>.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Sudo, read
[docs/UPGRADE.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md) for information on changes in
behavior that may affect you.

For a history of sudo see [docs/HISTORY.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/HISTORY.md).
You can find a list of contributors to sudo in
[docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

## Building the release

Read the installation guide, [INSTALL.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/INSTALL.md), before trying
to build sudo. Pay special attention to the "OS dependent notes" section.

## How to contribute

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on
how you can help contribute to sudo.

## Copyright

Sudo is distributed under an ISC-style license.
Refer to [LICENSE.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for details.

## Mailing lists

#### sudo-announce

This list receives announcements whenever a new version of sudo is
released. <https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-announce>

#### sudo-blog

This list receives a message when a new sudo blog article is
available. <https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-blog>

#### sudo-commits

This list receives a message for each commit made to the sudo source
repository. <https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-commits>

#### sudo-users

This list is for questions and general discussion about sudo.
<https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-users>

#### sudo-workers

This list is for people working on and porting sudo.
<https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-workers>

To subscribe to a list, visit its url (listed above) and enter your
email address to subscribe. Digest versions are available but these are
fairly low traffic lists so the digest versions are not a significant win.

Mailing list archives are also available. See the mailing list web sites
for the appropriate links.

## Sudo web page

There is a sudo web page at <https://www.sudo.ws/> that contains
documentation, downloads, a bug tracker, the source repo, the sudo
blog, information about beta versions and other useful info.

## Filing bug reports/issues

If you believe you have found a bug, you can either file a bug
report in the sudo bug database, <https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/>, or open
a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues),
whichever you find easier. If you would prefer to use email,
messages may be sent to the [sudo-workers@sudo.ws mailing
list](https://www.sudo.ws/mailman/listinfo/sudo-workers) (public)
or to sudo@sudo.ws (private).

For sudo's security policy and how to report security issues, see
[docs/SECURITY.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md).

Please check [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](/sudo-project/sudo/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
*before* submitting a bug report. When reporting bugs, be sure to
include the version of sudo you are using, the operating system
and/or distro that is affected, and, if possible, step-by-step
instructions to reproduce the problem.

The **doas** command provides a way to perform commands as another user. It aims to be a a simplified and lightweight replacement for [sudo](/wiki/Sudo "Sudo"). The doas tool was originally written for [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) by Ted Unangst. *OpenDoas* is a port of doas for Linux, which is available as the [app-admin/doas](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/doas) package.

### Emerge

`root #``emerge --ask app-admin/doas`
## Configuration

The doas tool is configured by the ruleset specified in /etc/doas.conf. By using an empty configuration file the default ruleset will be applied which denies all actions.

### Permissions

Create a empty /etc/doas.conf file:

`root #``touch /etc/doas.conf`

Set the recommended ownership and permissions for the /etc/doas.conf file:

`root #``chown -c root:root /etc/doas.conf`
`root #``chmod -c 0400 /etc/doas.conf`
### Basic configuration

A simple skeleton configuration could be to specify a rule which allows all users in the wheel group to perform any action as root.

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Allow all users in the wheel group to execute any command as root**
```
permit :wheel

```

It's also possible to deny certain actions to specified users. The ruleset is evaluated in a hierarchical manner, thus adding a new rule can override the previous one:

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Deny a user to execute a command**
```
permit :wheel
deny larry cmd fdisk

```

The user larry is part of the wheel group and therefore may perform actions available to root, but the second rule denies this user access to the fdisk command.

### Authentication

The nopass keyword provides the ability for users in a certain group to perform elevated actions without having to enter a password:

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Allow all users in the wheel group to perform actions as root without authentication**
```
permit nopass :wheel

```
#### Persist

 **Note**
Due to OpenBSD-specific kernel API required by doas to set and clear timeouts, the persist feature is disabled by default in the *OpenDoas* port.

Using the persist keyword doas can remember an authenticated user and will not require confirmation by password for a time period of five minutes after the last doas command was entered in the terminal window:

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Do not require passwords for five minutes for all users in the wheel group**
```
permit persist :wheel

```

Note: Persist support is enabled via the `persist` USE flag on [app-admin/doas](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/doas)

### Commands

The doas tool allows the creation of rules which only apply to certain commands.

A rule can be specified to allow a certain user to use a command only available to root:

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Allow a user to use the reboot command without a password**
```
permit nopass larry cmd /sbin/reboot

```

 **Tip**
For security reasons, *OpenDoas* recommends specifying absolute paths like shown above. However, doas can use the target user's [PATH](/wiki/Handbook%3AX86/Working/EnvVar "Handbook:X86/Working/EnvVar") in execution. When configuring `permit nopass larry cmd reboot` instead, larry does not need to specify the directory path.

This allows the user larry to execute `doas /sbin/reboot` without having to enter a password. This may allow users to use restricted commands without providing complete root access.

### Environment variables

By default, doas creates a new environment for the program. This behavior may be overridden with the setenv and keepenv keywords:

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Preserve LANG, LC\_ALL, and PATH**
```
permit setenv { LANG LC_ALL PATH } :wheel

```

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Override PATH**
```
permit setenv { PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin } :wheel

```

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Preserve all environment variables**
```
permit keepenv :wheel

```
### Testing

A configuration file can be tested as follows:

`user $``doas -C /etc/doas.conf`

Specifying a command to test if the currently running user has permissions to perform a specific command:

`user $``doas -C /etc/doas.conf cat`

This test will output deny if the currently running user does not have the permissions to execute the cat command.

Permissions can be checked for a specified user via:

`user $``doas -C /etc/doas.conf cat -u larry`

If the user larry has permissions to access cat it may output permit.

### Targets

The doas can not only be used to perform actions with root privileges, it also allows to target certain users.

FILE **`/etc/doas.conf`****Allow a user to perform actions as another user**
```
permit nopass larry as postgres

```

By adding this rule, the user larry is allowed to perform actions as the postgres user without having to enter a password.

### Bash tab completion

By default bash will only tab complete files and directories within the current or referenced directory. To tell bash to complete arguments as if they were separate commands (also leveraging the tab completion settings of other commands) the following can be added to either the users .bashrc, or the global /etc/bashrc.

FILE **`~/.bashrc`****Configure tab completion**
```
#     Complete arguments as if they were commands
#     (eg: `doas emer<tab>` -> `doas emerge`)
#     (eg: `doas dd status=p<tab>` -> `doas dd status=progress`)
#    Complete arguments as if they were directory names (default behavior)
#     (eg: `doas /bi<tab>` -> `doas /bin/`)
# If you have app-shells/bash-completion installed
complete -F _root_command doas
# Alternative that doesn't require app-shells/bash-completion
# However this doesn't complete arguments, among other things
complete -cf doas

```
## Usage

The doas command can be used like sudo:

`user $``doas emerge -uDN @world`

See [doas(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/doas) for more information.

That news is repeating itself ever since I remember. Maybe a good time to plug doas, a simpler alternative to sudo from OpenBSD folks[1], developed partly due to security fears about sudo. It’s also been ported to Linux and is available in e.g. Alpine and Debian.

It is also being actively developed with ~270,000 changes resulting in a net increase of ~40,000 lines in the last twelve months. In contrast doas is, just eyeballing it, maybe ~500 lines and at most 1000 lines all together. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [psychoslave](user?id=psychoslave) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33469253)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468518) | [next](#33470209) [–]  From a security point of view, staying small reduces attack surface. So if this holds all the features you need, that’s a valid option. It doesn’t remove a bit of how impressive the dedication of Todd C. Miller is of course. These are two solutions with a common core goal but greatly different concerns. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [binkHN](user?id=binkHN) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470879)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33469253) | [next](#33470209) [–]  Todd is a saint for the work that he does here. Ultimately, like many other OpenBSD-related decisions, sudo was replaced by doas because of all the security-related issues with the code. Oftentimes, OpenBSD will replace a very functional solution, that has too many security issues, with one that has far less security issues and is, simply, good enough. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Denvercoder9](user?id=Denvercoder9) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470209)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468518) | [prev](#33469253) | [next](#33468944) [–]  > ~2,936,000 changes I don't think it makes sense to add all added and removed lines together and call it "changes": for example, this counts even a single character typo fix as 2 changes. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [efficax](user?id=efficax) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33468944)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468518) | [prev](#33470209) | [next](#33468983) [–]  why on earth is sudo so complicated.

A lot of people *do* want to do more, especially in some corporate contexts people run very complex sudo setups. Consider something like Linode; maybe you want some of the more experienced support people to issue *some* commands on *some* machines, without having full control. And you've got a gazillion machines so you don't want to setup each one individually (as well as revoke access once they leave). Things can get fairly complex pretty quickly once you move out of simple settings. For my desktop machine, doas is perfect. For our servers it's fine too because we have just a few people with access. But I'm not everyone of course. doas was explicitly written to NOT cover all use cases, and that makes it better for the (simpler) use cases it was intended to solve, at the price of not covering other use cases of course. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hellcow](user?id=hellcow) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471497)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33470108) | [next](#33479263) [–]  Maybe I’m misunderstanding you but doas handles the use-case you describe. I can enforce that some users can issue some commands on a given machine in doas.conf As someone who manages infra including Linux and OpenBSD and does configure sudo and doas in this way, I’m pretty sure 99% of users would be fine with the simpler tool. Maybe the simpler, safer tool should be the default. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Beltalowda](user?id=Beltalowda) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33475240)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33471497) | [next](#33479263) [–]  I don't think doas can integrate with PAM, LDAP, and all of that, and the possibilities doas.conf give you are vastly less than what the sudoers file gives you. > I’m pretty sure 99% of users would be fine with the simpler tool That probably sound about right, give or take a few %; it probably *should* be the de-facto default, with sudo being used when doas doesn't suffice. But the question was "why on earth is sudo so complicated?", and the answer to that is "because some people want/need complicated stuff". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tored](user?id=tored) [on Nov 5, 2022](item?id=33479263)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33470108) | [prev](#33471497) | [next](#33471495) [–]  From a security standpoint point you would want the opposite, the stricter doas on the more exposed servers and and the less strict sudo on the personal desktop. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ilyt](user?id=ilyt) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471495)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468944) | [prev](#33470108) | [next](#33477137) [–]  That's the problem. We use sudo that autorizes user by it's SSH key via its auth socket... so we can essentially authenticate sudo via smartcard (Yubikey), and not keep the private key on user machine. Some other folks use LDAP to get the sudoers files or even allowed ssh keys itself There is also "just run thing as user" but also "set up same way shell would and pretend user logged as different user", first one is simple, second is a bunch of setup, copying env variables etc. There is a good argument for splitting "just run app as different user" and "everything else that has to do with interactive shell and admins doing things on server" but now you have 2 configs to manage... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rtpg](user?id=rtpg) [on Nov 5, 2022](item?id=33477137)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468944) | [prev](#33471495) | [next](#33471890) [–]  "ensure authorization" and "raise privileges" and "call exec" are all behind plugin-based architectures to allow for people to set up various ways to do things. The simple example: why do you only need to type in the password once per session/30 minutes calling sudo in most environments? How can people set things up with a hardware key? How do you make just some commands work and not others? That being said I don't think sudo's code is complicated? It's big because it has all of these plugins supporting various mechanisms, but each file is pretty straightforward, and the control flow is really not that hard (after you get that it's plugins). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [e12e](user?id=e12e) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471890)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468944) | [prev](#33477137) | [next](#33469046) [–]  > All I want it to do is: ensure authorization, raise privileges, call exec.

This is impressive, but maybe a little more complicated than I want to get with a basic security tool. I suspect most people who don't have to modify it very often are going to secondary sources, like tutorials or stack overflow, and copying examples from there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tgv](user?id=tgv) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471377)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33470106) | [next](#33472209) [–]  IMO, a more complex grammar allows for better descriptions. The only real type of grammar simpler than CFG is a regular expression. That's pretty limited, although (the older part of) CSS doesn't need more than that. But as soon as you want a nested construction, hierarchy or simply nested parentheses, you need a CFG. If it's difficult to configure, the problem is the (configuration) language, not the power of its grammar. And there are excellent parser generators out there. You don't have to fear introducing bugs via them. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rob-olmos](user?id=rob-olmos) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33472209)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33470106) | [prev](#33471377) | [next](#33475609) [–]  Yea I sometimes have to refresh my memory on sudoers or just search for what I want to accomplish, hoping that someone has already handled the potential security gotchas (eg, exact fullpath command should always be specified). I agree, in some typical cases I only need to specify "<user> can become root" or "<user> can become <user of group>", kinda like doas already does I think. I'll probably try out doas when the next such special need arises, then resort to sudo if doas is insufficient for some reason. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Quekid5](user?id=Quekid5) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33475609)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33470106) | [prev](#33472209) | [next](#33469470) [–]  > [...] as a context free grammar using EBNF notation. This is impressive, but maybe a little more complicated than I want to get with a basic security tool. I apologize if I'm being trite, but Context Free Grammar doesn't mean that the semantics of whatever that grammar describes is simple. It just means that it's simple to parse into ... something. Parsing a CFG is also not impressive in the slightest. It is, in fact, trivial since the 1970s. Anyway, You shouldn't be scared of the CFG bit... you should be scared of the semantics. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tetris11](user?id=tetris11) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33469470)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33468944) | [prev](#33469046) | [next](#33468983) [–]  I also wonder.... ```     function sudo { su -c "$@"  root }  ``` though I guess half the struggle is enabling sudo without a password | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [iso1631](user?id=iso1631) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471707)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33469470) | [next](#33468983) [–]  "sudo" asks you for *your* individual password.

We're indeed looking at starting a migration, because some DNS based, LDAP integrated, PAM integrated, really complicated priviledge escalator is becoming kinda scary as of late. The biggest difference we found is that sudo is a little more convenient to manage with a config management solution, since each piece of config management code can just drop a file in /etc/sudoers.d. With doas, we have to coordinate a bunch of parts of the config management manipulating one file, /etc/doas.conf. This always turns out a bit messy. But maybe we'll just merge everything into one big and somewhat messy monster doas-conf-template with a ton of feature toggles and loops and go from there. But beyond that, almost all of our sudo rules are 2-3 patterns: Admin can sudo as everyone, zabbix/telegraf can run data gathering commands, and maybe some other automation triggers like pgbackrest wiping a postgres data dir during a restore, that's about it. All of those are pretty trivial doas rules all in all. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yjftsjthsd-h](user?id=yjftsjthsd-h) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33468922)   | [root](#33467000) | [parent](#33467763) | [next](#33468970) [–]  The biggest difference we found is that sudo is a little more convenient to manage with a config management solution, since each piece of config management code can just drop a file in /etc/sudoers.d.

For the io logs: auditing. And in some cases such logs are necessary for compliance reasons. For wildcards: allowing to run a command, but only if they supply a specific option that makes it less dangerous. Now, you do have to be very careful when doing that, but there are cases where it is useful and explicitly listing every variation of options that is allowed isn't practical.

If you have app server and use it to give access for developers to restart their apps, them getting root on the server is entirely irrelevant. It's more so the curious dev don't just go *sudo bash* and changes stuff willy nilly then forgets what they changed.

When UNIX SDKs became commercial, it was even worse, you would naturally one buy the main one, not pay twice for programming languages.

I did not mean to imply that literally any other language would have been *better for sudo*, which I see is a viable reading of my original post. Go, for instance, would be a terrible choice, because the way the runtime deeply assumes you're running in a multithread environment, even before it gets to your "main" function, means that exactly the sort of UNIX hackery sudo is designed to do is effectively impossible. I have a system myself that is otherwise entirely in Go, but we have a very small C-based wrapper whose job it is to be setuid, open a few files with the escalated privileges, do some user verification, then change its uid and gid and exec the "real" Go program, because Go just can't do those things. Dynamically typed languages as a whole would be a bad idea. Java's startup time for such a small executable would be a problem. I'm just saying *this* problem is unique to C, and in my opinion, sufficiently endemic to security software to disqualify it entirely. Mind you, you might well end up at Rust in the end anyhow.

RH does have an interest in Rust, used in projects such as Stratis. It's just that the Linux dev ecosystem has been very C-reliant for a long time, and a massive amount of binding and other ecosystem work is still happening to make this possible. \*EDIT:\* and the reason I mention Rust specifically is that, in these types of lower-level projects, a *lot* of things can start to get hairy very quickly in higher level languages. Things like some namespace APIs very much wanting to be run on a single thread, or trying to maintain performance when you're intercepting and examining *every* D-Bus message, or even just when you want your functionality to be in a reusable core library. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [adrianN](user?id=adrianN) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33467711)   | [root](#33466303) | [parent](#33466839) | [next](#33466855) [–]  Safer systems languages than C predate C. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cryptonector](user?id=cryptonector) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33468547)   | [root](#33466303) | [parent](#33467711) | [next](#33466855) [–]  But the Unix environment is written in C, and there's a ton of legacy from the past several decades still to migrate from C.

Not eliminated, just reduced. 3) Less common architectures POWER and s390x are still relevant platforms in enterprise and while languages like Rust do have some support for them, C compilers for those platforms definitely get more attention. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chpatrick](user?id=chpatrick) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470100)   | [root](#33466303) | [parent](#33467481) | [next](#33466716) [–]  What about modern C++? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dottedmag](user?id=dottedmag) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33466716)   | [root](#33466303) | [parent](#33466452) | [prev](#33466855) | [next](#33466408) [–]  You meant unsafe, not non-GC? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cbrogrammer](user?id=cbrogrammer) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33466408)   | [parent](#33466303) | [prev](#33466351) | [next](#33466813) [–]  We could start by considering not writing stuff like > /\* > \* Truncate to 8 chars if standard DES since not all crypt()'s do this. > \* If this turns out not to be safe we will have to use OS #ifdef's (sigh). > \*/ > sav = pass[8]; | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [userbinator](user?id=userbinator) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33466813)   | [parent](#33466303) | [prev](#33466408) | [next](#33467001) [–]  The solution is simplicity, not more complexity.

Thing is, I am a single developer with rent to pay and a family to feed. In all honesty, I would have little to gain when rewriting sudo / mission critical software in a secure language. What I was going for is that gigantic companies with tens of thousands of people and manpower use tools like sudo / brew / sqlite / <security dependant tool x> every day. They are the ones who would benefit the most by rewriting critical software in something else than C, and they seem to be getting on that track for internal software.

I did some extensive testing of this some years ago (on Debian/Ubuntu) and many system services and tools expect/require these directories to have specific ownership and permissions. In the context I was experimenting with it was pretty simple too - renaming the UID 0 'root' account to some other name. That revealed that many tools actually test for "root" (the string) not uid == 0. As I dug into the code of those tools I found many would also check and insist on particular ownership and modes on the directories and files. I forget which one really annoyed me, but 'all' I wanted to do was allow members of group 'adm' to read/write into a particular sub-directory of /etc/ but the service would bail out if the directory wasn't owned by "root":"root" (or 0:0) and had 0700 permissions which is a pain when wanting to run services unprivileged and using 'setcap' to enable capabilities without starting as UID 0 and dropping privileges. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [BeefWellington](user?id=BeefWellington) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471765)   | [root](#33466430) | [parent](#33466910) | [prev](#33470461) | [next](#33470012) [–]  An alternate approach is to set the sysctl for this: ```     net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  ``` Or whatever port you want unprivileged to start at.

AppArmor gets us part of the way there but the UI to make everything play nice is too difficult.

And even if modern C++ is amazing -- I have no doubt it's improving all the time -- that doesn't change the fact that there are metric tons of C++ code out there that nobody will ever modernize. So C++ getting improved with time is sadly an almost moot point. I'd personally advocate for Rust but I've heard people say there are a few other languages that allow you to achieve the same memory safety so, by all means, let's please start rewriting and make our everyday tools something different than a Swiss cheese of potential and actual security threats. It really is time. The language doesn't matter, the outcomes do. And in terms of outcomes I maintain that C and C++ have not stood the test of time in terms of security and amount of foot guns. Too much sentimental value is attached to them as well and that doesn't help matters either. We work with tech. We don't make love with it. We should all start acting like this is a job and not [only] a hobby. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pjmlp](user?id=pjmlp) [on Nov 5, 2022](item?id=33481388)   | [root](#33474650) | [parent](#33475550) | [next](#33466210) [–]  > Sure C++ is a tad better than C but compared to e.g. Rust and Zig it's pretty convoluted and verbose when trying to achieve things that they achieve with 2-5 liners. yeah, if one is stuck in C++98 mentality. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pdimitar](user?id=pdimitar) [on Nov 5, 2022](item?id=33481839)   | [root](#33474650) | [parent](#33481388) | [next](#33466210) [–]  Like a ton of existing C++ code out there? :P I don't make the rules, sadly I've been forced to leave code to never be upgraded again.

Complexity High isn't about what an attacker gets, it's about whether or not any specific configuration must exist for the attack to happen. For instance, if an app that talks to several services over different file transfer protocols has a vulnerability in only the FTP component, and these are not under attacker control, that's Complexity High. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TheBrokenRail](user?id=TheBrokenRail) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33470975)   | [prev](#33466949) | [next](#33473357) [–]  Seriously, why is sudo so complicated? Most of the time, all sudo has to do is hash a password, check that hash against a file, and if successful, run a program as root. Why can't we just have a minimal version of sudo that does just that and only that so the majority of smaller servers and home users can run sudo without fear of a security bug ever other month? Preferably using the same executable path so that everything else doesn't break. It just seems like most of sudo's security bugs come from weird obscure features almost no one uses. Like that time sudoedit had a security issue. I didn't even know that command existed until it broke things, and it still seems pointless when you can just run "sudo nano" or "sudo vi". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sersnth](user?id=sersnth) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471225)   | [parent](#33470975) | [next](#33471058) [–]  sudoedit runs the editor as the original non-privileged user, which is nice if you're using a configurable text editor like vim/emacs so you're not suddenly using whatever (lack of) configuration the root user has setup.

Buffer overflows are not possible with bounds checking. Using a language that provides containers with bounds checked access methods would have prevented this. This isn't a point of debate or something, it's a fact. C is virtually the only language that doesn't provide a safe way to access elements. C++ provides bounds checking with std::array, std::vector and std::string using the "at()" methods. All Rust containers are checked by default. Pretty much every other language also is checked by default as well. All of these language's could have prevented this error and the other buffer overflow errors which there are tons of. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eklitzke](user?id=eklitzke) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33473814)   | [root](#33468666) | [parent](#33473651) | [next](#33471967) [–]  Sure but you wouldn't be reading a password into a std::array or std::vector in C++, you'd be reading into a std::string or possibly something like a std::stringstream. And both of those containers will handle sizing and reallocation for you. If your point is that C++ lets you do unsafe things then yes, of course it does. But so does Rust. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chlorion](user?id=chlorion) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33474428)   | [root](#33468666) | [parent](#33473814) | [next](#33471967) [–]  I think you may be misinterpreting my comment a bit, I did not mean that C++ was bad here, but rather a large improvement. My point was that in C++ (and others) you can completely prevent this entire class of errors by using the standard containers. std::string, just like std::vector and std::array provide the checked access methods which will prevent buffer overflows when used. Almost every language other than C lets you access elements of a container safely, and oftentimes even the default methods for access are safe! In C++ there are compiler flags that make operator[] safe by default for all of the std containers too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ilyt](user?id=ilyt) [on Nov 4, 2022](item?id=33471967)   | [root](#33468666) | [parent](#33471340) | [prev](#33473651) | [next](#33467793) [–]  sudo has long history of bugs that would be impossible in Rust in the first place. Yes, given enough care and effort you might write code that will not have those bugs, but not having a possibility (aside from unsafe{}) to have them in the first place is usually better approach.
