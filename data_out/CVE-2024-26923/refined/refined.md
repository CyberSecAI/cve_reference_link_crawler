{
  "CVE-2024-26923": {
    "Root cause": "The garbage collector in the af_unix module doesn't account for the risk of an embryo (a partially created socket) being enqueued during garbage collection. If this embryo has a peer carrying SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() could see different children. This can lead to an incorrectly incremented inflight count and subsequently a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition in garbage collector",
      "Incorrectly elevated inflight count",
      "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list can lead to system instability, crashes, or potentially privilege escalation through memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the race condition requires specific sequence of operations involving creation of unix sockets, sending file descriptors (SCM_RIGHTS), and closing sockets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have the ability to create and manipulate AF_UNIX sockets. Specifically, they need the ability to create connections, pass file descriptors via sendmsg(), and close sockets, which may be possible for a local user."
