# Timing attack risk in Harbor

Moderate

[stonezdj](/stonezdj)
published
GHSA-mq6f-5xh5-hgcf
Oct 8, 2023

## Package

Harbor

## Affected versions

<2.8.3 <2.7.3 <1.10.18

## Patched versions

v2.8.3, v2.7.3, v1.10.18

## Description

In the Harbor jobservice container, the comparison of secrets in the authenticator type is prone to timing attacks. The vulnerability occurs due to the following code:

[harbor/src/jobservice/api/authenticator.go](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/aaea068cceb4063ab89313d9785f2b40f35b0d63/src/jobservice/api/authenticator.go#L69-L69)

Line 69
in
[aaea068](/goharbor/harbor/commit/aaea068cceb4063ab89313d9785f2b40f35b0d63)

|  | if expectedSecret != secret { |
| --- | --- |

To avoid this issue, constant time comparison should be used.
```
subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(expectedSecret), []byte(secret)) == 0

```
### Impact

This attack might be possible theoretically, but no workable proof of concept is available, and access complexity is set at High.

The jobservice exposes these APIs

```
Create a job task --- POST /api/v1/jobs
Get job task information --- GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}
Stop job task ---  POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}
Get job log task ---  GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/log
Get job execution --- GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/executions
Get job stats ---  GET /api/v1/stats
Get job service configuration ---  GET /api/v1/config

```

It is used to create jobs/stop job tasks and retrieve job task information. If an attacker obtains the secrets, it is possible to retrieve the job information, create a job, or stop a job task.

The following versions of Harbor are involved:

<=Harbor 2.8.2, <=Harbor 2.7.2, <= Harbor 2.6.x, <=Harbor 1.10.17

### Patches

Harbor 2.8.3, Harbor 2.7.3, Harbor 1.10.18

### Workarounds

Because the jobservice only exposes HTTP service to harbor-core containers, blocking any inbound traffic from the external network to the jobservice container can reduce the risk.

### Credits

Thanks to Porcupiney Hairs for reporting this issue.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2023-20902
