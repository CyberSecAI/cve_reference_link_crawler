- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute actions that are normally reserved for higher-privileged users. Specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly specified, but it involves exploiting a function lacking proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated user is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
