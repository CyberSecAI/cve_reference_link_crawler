### Description

If I add an additional user and role to the broker, and without adding this role to RBAC settings or Hawtio enabled roles, any user having this role is able to enter into the Management Console, and can read some information from queues at the left side of the screen (queues names, queue types, acceptors, etc.)

He should not be able to ever access the Management console
