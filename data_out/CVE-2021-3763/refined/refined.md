Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect privilege check in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console. Specifically, a user with a role that is not explicitly declared within the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) settings or Hawtio enabled roles, can still gain access to the management console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The system fails to properly enforce role-based access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access the management console.
- **Bypass of Permissions:** Users are able to bypass the usual permission checks despite not having the correct roles assigned within the RBAC configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Users who are not supposed to have access to the management console can still access it, potentially reading information such as queue names, queue types, acceptors, and other configuration details from the left side of the screen. The impact is mainly to confidentiality, as some privileged meta-information is disclosed.
- **Limited Access:** While the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the console, not all information is accessible. The impact is described as limited and does not affect integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the AMQ Broker and its management console can exploit this flaw by using the credentials of a user that exists on the broker but does not have the correct RBAC permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs valid user credentials for the AMQ broker.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the AMQ Broker instance and its management console (typically accessible via a web browser).

**Technical Details:**
The issue is triggered when a user and role are added to the broker's configuration (`artemis-roles.properties` and `artemis-users.properties`) but not explicitly configured in the RBAC settings. When the user then attempts to access the Management Console using these credentials they are able to view certain information that they should not have access to.
The vulnerability was found in AMQ broker versions 7.8.0, 7.8.1, and 7.8.2. It is fixed in version 7.9.0.

**Summary**
In summary, the CVE-2021-3763 describes a vulnerability in Red Hat AMQ Broker where improper role checks within the management console allow users with incorrectly configured roles to gain unauthorized, albeit limited, access. This results in a confidentiality breach with the potential to disclose certain meta-information. The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.9.0.
