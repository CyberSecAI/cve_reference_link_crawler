Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-35966**.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old()` function within the Linux kernel's Bluetooth RFCOMM implementation. This function was found to be copying data from user space without properly validating the length of the input, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `copy_from_sockptr` function, used by `rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old`, was not checking the length of the user-provided data against the size of the destination buffer before copying.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:**  The out-of-bounds read can result in a kernel crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for information disclosure:** While not explicitly mentioned, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes expose sensitive kernel data, although this is not the primary impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- **`setsockopt` system call:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling the `setsockopt` system call on an RFCOMM socket and providing a crafted option value with an invalid length.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user:** The attacker needs to have the ability to open an RFCOMM socket and call `setsockopt` on it. This means a local user with appropriate privileges would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix replaces `copy_from_sockptr` with `bt_copy_from_sockptr`, which performs length validation before copying.
- The vulnerability was reported by syzbot, a fuzzer for the Linux kernel.
- The fix addresses multiple instances of the vulnerability within `rfcomm_sock_setsockopt_old` and `rfcomm_sock_setsockopt`.
