Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-26726.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a logic error in the Btrfs filesystem driver where it incorrectly drops the extent map for the free space inode when a write error occurs. This leads to a subsequent attempt to write the space cache, which results in a crash due to an invalid extent map being returned.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of errors when writing to the free space cache inode.
- Failure to preserve extent map information for the free space cache inode after a write error.
- Logic error in `btrfs_drop_extent_map_range` that does not account for free space inodes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.
- System instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a write error while writing to the free space cache.
- The vulnerability is triggered by normal system operations interacting with the btrfs filesystem

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to cause a write error on the Btrfs filesystem
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned as required, but the ability to interact with the filesystem is necessary.

The provided patches address the issue by introducing an exception for free space inodes, ensuring that their extent maps are not dropped in case of a write error.
