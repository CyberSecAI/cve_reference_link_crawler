# Submit #431686: code-projects Blood Bank Management System 1.0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | code-projects Blood Bank Management System 1.0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | A SQL Injection vulnerability has been identified in the BloodBank Management System version 1.0, specifically in the cancel request functionality. This flaw arises from a lack of proper input sanitization on the reqid parameter, enabling malicious users to inject SQL commands into the query handling cancellation requests. The vulnerability allows for a time-based blind SQL injection attack. In this scenario, an attacker injects code that makes the system execute time-intensive SQL operations, such as using the BENCHMARK function, to delay the response. If the request is valid, the system delays by a predefined amount of time, confirming that the injection worked. This technique can lead to: Exfiltration of sensitive data over time. Denial of Service (DoS) by slowing down the system. Tampering with blood request statuses, including unauthorized cancellations. |

[**sqli\_cancel\_request.md**](#file-sqli_cancel_request-md)

## **Affected Version:**

* **BloodBank Management System**: 1.0

## **Vulnerability Information:**

* **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)
* **Severity:** HIGH
* **Status:** Unpatched

## **Vulnerable Endpoint:**

* `/file/cancel.php?reqid=2`

## **Vulnerability Description:**

A **SQL Injection vulnerability** has been identified in the **BloodBank Management System** version 1.0, specifically in the **cancel request functionality**. This flaw arises from a lack of proper input sanitization on the `reqid` parameter, enabling malicious users to inject SQL commands into the query handling cancellation requests.

The vulnerability allows for a **time-based blind SQL injection** attack. In this scenario, an attacker injects code that makes the system execute time-intensive SQL operations, such as using the **`BENCHMARK` function**, to delay the response. If the request is valid, the system delays by a predefined amount of time, confirming that the injection worked. This technique can lead to:

* **Exfiltration of sensitive data** over time.
* **Denial of Service (DoS)** by slowing down the system.
* **Tampering with blood request statuses**, including unauthorized cancellations.

---

## **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

Below is an example of a **GET** request demonstrating the time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability:

```
GET /file/cancel.php?reqid=2'%20AND%202655%3dBENCHMARK(5000000%2cMD5(0x74466957))--%20pFWQ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="129", "Not=A?Brand";v="8"
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux"
Accept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/129.0.6668.71 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Cookie: PHPSESSID=48068ce7875c00d88ca3aa2b9269b91f
Connection: keep-alive

```
### **Explanation:**

In this PoC, the query includes a **`BENCHMARK` function** that forces the system to perform **5,000,000 MD5 operations**, resulting in a delayed response if the SQL query executes successfully. The response time confirms the injection vulnerability and demonstrates that the backend is susceptible to such attacks.

## **Impact:**

* **Data Breach:** Attackers could extract data from the database over time.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Multiple malicious requests could overload the server, reducing system availability.
* **Unauthorized Cancellations:** Attackers could cancel blood requests without proper authorization, disrupting critical processes.
* **System Integrity Issues:** Alterations in request records could cause confusion or operational failures in blood request management.

---

## **Mitigation Recommendations:**

1. **Use Parameterized Queries:** Replace dynamic queries with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
2. **Input Validation:** Ensure that all input parameters, including `reqid`, are properly validated and sanitized.
3. **Database Privileges:** Limit the database user's permissions to minimize potential damage from an exploit.
4. **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing detailed error messages that might aid attackers in crafting injections.
5. **Rate Limiting and Monitoring:** Monitor requests and apply rate limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
6. **Security Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing and code reviews to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities early.
