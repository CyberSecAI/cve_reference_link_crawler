Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10416 (Note: The provided content doesn't explicitly mention this CVE ID, but the vulnerability details match the described CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw due to lack of proper input sanitization on the `reqid` parameter in the `/file/cancel.php` endpoint of the Blood Bank Management System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, time-based blind SQL injection is possible. The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied `reqid` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data can be extracted from the database by injecting SQL queries designed for data exfiltration.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can slow down or crash the system by injecting time-intensive SQL operations.
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can tamper with blood request statuses, including unauthorized cancellation of requests.
- **System Integrity Issues:** Alterations in request records can cause confusion or operational failures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/file/cancel.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code into the `reqid` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/file/cancel.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`reqid`).
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads and understand how to use time-based injection techniques like `BENCHMARK()`.

**Technical Details:**
- The attack uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, where the attacker cannot see the direct output of the SQL query, but infers results based on the time it takes for the server to respond.
- The `BENCHMARK` function is used to create a time delay, confirming that the injected SQL code is executed.
- A sample GET request is provided that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:
  ```
  GET /file/cancel.php?reqid=2'%20AND%202655%3dBENCHMARK(5000000%2cMD5(0x74466957))--%20pFWQ HTTP/1.1
  ```
- The PoC uses the `BENCHMARK` function to force the database to perform 5,000,000 MD5 hash calculations, causing a delay in response if the injection is successful.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization of the `reqid` parameter.
- Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
- Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to the client.
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring mechanisms.
- Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing.
