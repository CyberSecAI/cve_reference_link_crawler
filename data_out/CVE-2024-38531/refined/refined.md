The content provided contains information about CVE-2024-38531.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `fchmodat2(2)` syscall, available in Linux kernel >=6.6 and glibc 2.39, was not being filtered by the libseccomp sandbox used by Nix. This allowed a build process to change the permissions of the build directory, potentially creating setuid binaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate syscall filtering: The seccomp sandbox did not block the `fchmodat2` syscall, which can be used to modify file permissions, including setting the setuid bit.
- Build directory permissions: Build processes had write access to the build directory, which they could manipulate to create setuid binaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: A malicious local user can create a setuid binary in a globally accessible location, then assume the permissions of a Nix daemon worker.
- Build hijacking: By assuming the permissions of a Nix daemon worker, the attacker can hijack all future builds.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have access to a local user account.
- Nix daemon access: The local user also needs access to the Nix daemon.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the system.
- Ability to interact with the Nix daemon (though not necessarily as a trusted user).
- The seccomp sandbox must be disabled or ineffective (e.g. `filter-syscalls` set to false or running a vulnerable kernel/glibc combination).

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was addressed by:
- Adding a syscall filter for `fchmodat2`.
- Moving build processes to a sub-directory owned by and accessible only to the Nix daemon.
- The fix also requires libseccomp >= 2.5.5 to correctly filter the new syscall.
- Setting `build-dir` to a location only accessible by `root`
- Running your Nix daemon with `$TMPDIR` set to a location only accessible by `root`
