| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2221760#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2023-07-10 17:10:21 UTC  ``` Keycloak does not correctly validate its client step-up authentication. A password-authed attacker could use this flaw to register a false second auth factor, alongside the existing one, to a targeted account. The second factor then permits step-up authentication.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2221760#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:26:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22.0.10  Via RHSA-2024:1868 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1868](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1868)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2221760#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-16 20:27:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 22  Via RHSA-2024:1867 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1867](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A1867)   ``` |  |
