- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a password hash that provides insufficient protection for local messaging users on the IBM MQ Appliance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient password hashing algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The insufficient password protection could potentially allow an attacker to compromise local messaging user accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially leverage the weak password hashes to gain unauthorized access to messaging resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have access to the stored password hashes or to the system that uses them.
