  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin is missing proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker could use social engineering to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website which sends a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to entice an authenticated user to send a request. This is often done by the user visiting a crafted site or clicking on a crafted URL while logged in to the target WordPress site."
