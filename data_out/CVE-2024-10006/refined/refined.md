- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of header normalization in Consul's L7 traffic intentions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Multiple headers and/or case-sensitivity could be exploited to bypass HTTP header-based access rules defined in L7 intentions.
    -  The vulnerability stems from a failure to normalize HTTP headers before applying access control rules, allowing attackers to manipulate headers to circumvent intended access restrictions.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass intended access control rules defined in L7 traffic intentions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to services.
-  **Attack vectors:** By sending HTTP requests with multiple headers or with headers that differ only in case, attackers can bypass the access rules defined in the L7 intentions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a service protected by Consul L7 intentions.
    - Attacker must be able to manipulate HTTP headers.
