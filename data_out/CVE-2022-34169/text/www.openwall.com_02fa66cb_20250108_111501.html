However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.

This appears to be a duplicate of CVE-2022-34169 (also issued by the
Apache CNA), and previously discussed on this list at [1]. It was
eventually reported to the list that the vulnerability was actually in
bcel [2].
