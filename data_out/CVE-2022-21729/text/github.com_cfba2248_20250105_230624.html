# Overflow and divide by zero in `UnravelIndex`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-34f9-hjfq-rr8j
Feb 2, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.8.0

## Patched versions

2.5.3, 2.6.3, 2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation of `UnravelIndex`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unravel_index_op.cc#L36-L135) is vulnerable to a division by zero caused by an integer overflow bug:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex(indices=-0x100000,dims=[0x100000,0x100000])
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/58b34c6c8250983948b5a781b426f6aa01fd47af).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
