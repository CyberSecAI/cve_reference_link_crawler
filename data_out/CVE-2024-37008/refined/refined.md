Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Autodesk Revit software. This occurs when parsing a maliciously crafted DWG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. This type of vulnerability can be triggered when a program writes beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current Revit process. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as complete system compromise, data theft, or other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted DWG file. When a user opens this specially crafted file in a vulnerable version of Revit, it triggers the stack-based buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DWG file.
- The attacker would need to convince a user to open the malicious DWG file with a vulnerable version of Autodesk Revit. Thus, user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- **Revit:** Versions 2025, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are affected.
- **Revit LT:** Versions 2025, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are affected.

**Mitigated Versions:**
- **Revit & Revit LT:** Versions 2025.1, 2024.2.2, 2023.1.5, and 2022.1.7.
