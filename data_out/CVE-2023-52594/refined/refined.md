{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An array-index-out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `ath9k_htc_txstatus` function within the Linux kernel's ath9k driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `txs->cnt` variable, which comes from a USB URB, can be larger than the `txs->txstatus` array size (`HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS`).",
      "The code uses a `for` loop based on `txs->cnt` without proper bounds checking, leading to an out-of-bounds access to the `txs->txstatus` array.",
      "Although a `WARN_ON()` is present, it doesn't prevent out-of-bounds reads."
    ],
    "impact": "The out-of-bounds read can lead to a kernel crash (denial of service) and possibly other undefined behaviors.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious USB device providing a crafted URB with a large `txs->cnt` value could trigger the vulnerability.",
       "The vulnerability is triggered when handling tx status in ath9k_htc_txstatus, called through ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to control a USB device that interacts with the vulnerable ath9k driver. The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed USB URB which results in `txs->cnt` exceeding `HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS`."
  },
  "remediation": "The fix adds a check using `WARN_ON_ONCE` which, if `txs->cnt` is greater than `HTC_MAX_TX_STATUS`, the function will return, preventing the out-of-bounds read.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found by a modified version of syzkaller, a fuzzer, that discovered an array-index-out-of-bounds in htc_drv_txrx.c. The specific line and index are in the provided code, which states 'index 13 is out of range for type `__wmi_event_txstatus[12]`', indicating a buffer of size 12 and an attempt to access index 13."
