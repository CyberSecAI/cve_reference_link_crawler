Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect use of `kstrndup()` in the `wcd9335_codec_enable_dec()` function within the `sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c` file of the Linux kernel. The function was using `kstrndup()` to allocate memory for `widget_name`, despite the size of the string being known, where `kmemdup_nul()` should have been used instead, as per kernel documentation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The code used `kstrndup()` when `kmemdup_nul()` was the more appropriate function. This is a coding error and a deviation from the recommended practice within the kernel.
-   **Potential for Future Issues:** Although the immediately passed values had lengths below the specified limit, the use of the less specific `kstrndup` could mask potential issues if future inputs had a length that might have caused a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unspecified impact:**  The CVE description states that this vulnerability allows attackers to have an unspecified impact. Although the bugzilla report notes that the issue doesn't hit in reality because the strings passed are always shorter than 15 bytes, the vulnerability could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service if the assumptions about input lengths are violated in the future.
-   The fix was deemed to be more of a sanity check rather than fixing an actual vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Unknown Vectors:** The CVE description mentions "unknown vectors" for exploitation. There is no specific exploitation scenario mentioned in the provided documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Unspecified:**  The provided text does not specify the necessary attacker capabilities or position to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information from the bugzilla entry suggests that while the code was not optimal, the vulnerability was deemed not exploitable in the current version due to the fixed length of inputs. The patch was applied more as a sanity check.
* The fix was a simple change to replace `kstrndup` with `kmemdup_nul`.
* The fix was included in the Linux kernel version 5.3.
* The fix was included in the Fedora 30 kernel update.
