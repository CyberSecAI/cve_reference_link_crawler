| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1136963#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-05-31 11:25:26 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-12454  An issue was discovered in wcd9335_codec_enable_dec in sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It uses kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors.

All the strings passed to this function are with the fixed length that is shorter than 15 ("ADC MUX?").  The patch is good for a future sanity check, but not really fixing any bugs.  Reassigned back to security team. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1136963#c2)  Takashi Iwai   2019-05-31 11:48:35 UTC  ``` In anyway I'll backport the fix once when it reaches to the Linus tree. It's needed only for SLE15 and later. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1136963#c3)  Takashi Iwai   2019-06-13 10:36:45 UTC  ``` The patch turned out to be bogus and incorrect, and will be likely reverted.  And the reported issue itself makes no sense, as explained in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1136963#c1).  I'd suggest to withdraw the CVE assignment. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1136963#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2019-07-15 08:57:12 UTC  ``` marking as invalid ``` |  |
