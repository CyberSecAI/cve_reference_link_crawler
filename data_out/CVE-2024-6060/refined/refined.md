- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application logs HTTP requests which can include user passwords and other sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insertion of sensitive information into log files (CWE-532).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Local attackers with access to log files can view sensitive information like user passwords which are logged in HTTP requests. This results in information disclosure
- **Attack vectors:** Local file access to the system where the Phloc Webscopes application is running, where the logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need local access to the log files generated by the Phloc Webscopes application.
