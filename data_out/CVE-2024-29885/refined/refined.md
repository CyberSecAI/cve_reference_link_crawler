Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `Report` class in Silverstripe CMS has a `canView` method intended to control access to reports. However, even when this method is configured to return `false`, reports could still be accessed directly via their URL if the user had the `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `canView` method's access restrictions were not enforced when accessing reports directly, bypassing intended access controls.
- **Permission Bypass:** Users with `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` were able to bypass `canView` restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Users could view reports they were not supposed to access based on the `canView` method's configuration.
- Confidentiality Breach: Sensitive information contained in reports could be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct URL Access: An attacker could directly access the report via its URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- `CMS_ACCESS_ReportAdmin` Permission: The attacker needs to have the permission to access the reports admin section.
- Knowledge of Report URL: The attacker needs to know the URL of the report they want to access.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects `silverstripe/reports` versions prior to 5.2.3
- The fix ensures that the `canView` check is properly respected when accessing reports directly.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium severity)
