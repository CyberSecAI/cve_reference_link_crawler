The provided content relates to CVE-2024-6125.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Login with phone number" WordPress plugin generating weak, 6-digit numeric reset codes for password resets. Additionally, there were no attempt or time limits enforced on using these codes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak password reset code generation using `mt_rand` (later changed to `wp_rand` in the fix) which only generates a 6 digit numeric code.
- Lack of attempt limits for using the reset code.
- Lack of time limits for using the reset code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can reset the password of any user by guessing a 6-digit numeric reset code because there are no restrictions on the number of attempts or the time in which the code is valid. This leads to unauthorized access and potential account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated access by sending a password reset request and guessing the reset code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the target WordPress instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a password reset request to trigger the generation of the weak code and then attempt to guess the 6-digit code before it's used by the intended user.
