In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: core: Free tzp copy along with the thermal zone

The object pointed to by tz->tzp may still be accessed after being
freed in thermal_zone_device_unregister(), so move the freeing of it
to the point after the removal completion has been completed at which
it cannot be accessed any more.
