Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `tpm2_checkquote` tool. The tool verifies if the combined digest of selected Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) matches the digest within a TPM quote but fails to validate if the PCR selection specified in the PCR input file matches the PCR selection indicated in the quote itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `tpm2_checkquote` tool does not properly validate the PCR selection from the untrusted PCR input file against the PCR selection in the quote.
*   **Mismatched PCR Mapping:** Attackers can manipulate the `TPML_PCR_SELECTION` structure in the PCR input file, causing digest values to be incorrectly mapped to PCR slots and banks.
*   **Reinterpretation of Data:** The vulnerability extends to reinterpreting data across PCR banks with different hashing algorithms, provided the total lengths are the same.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Misrepresentation of TPM State:** The primary impact is a misleading picture of the TPM state, as digest values are associated with the wrong PCR indices and/or banks.
*   **Circumvention of Measured Boot:** This vulnerability can be used to bypass measured boot security checks by manipulating PCR values, allowing a compromised OS to be attested as genuine.
*   **Compromised Remote Attestation:** The vulnerability can compromise most use cases of remote attestation, as the attacker can control which PCRs are "attested" to, thus fooling a relying party.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated PCR Input File:** Attackers craft a PCR input file containing an arbitrary `TPML_PCR_SELECTION` that doesn't match the one in the quote, while ensuring the digest values match.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft PCR Input Files:** Attackers need to create a manipulated PCR input file.
*   **Local or Privileged Access (Likely):** To exploit the vulnerability fully (e.g., for measured boot attacks), some form of local access on the targeted system to manipulate the TPM state is needed. Specifically, the ability to use TPM\_Extend to set PCR values to attacker controlled values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects `tpm2_checkquote` tool versions <= 5.6.
*   Patched versions are >= 5.5.1, >= 5.6.1, and >= 5.7.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a bash script.
*   The fix involves correcting `tpm2_checkquote.c` to verify that the `TPML_PCR_SELECTION` in the quote matches the one from the PCR input file.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision).

This vulnerability is considered critical because it can lead to a false sense of security and undermines the purpose of TPM-based attestation.
