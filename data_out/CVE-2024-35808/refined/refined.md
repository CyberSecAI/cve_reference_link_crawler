The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35808.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `md_reap_sync_thread()` function was being called directly from `raid_message()` without holding the `reconfig_mutex`. This is unsafe because `md_reap_sync_thread()` modifies fields protected by `reconfig_mutex`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition/Concurrency issue:** Calling `md_reap_sync_thread()` without holding `reconfig_mutex` creates a race condition, potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.
- **Deadlock potential:** Attempting to acquire `reconfig_mutex` before calling `md_reap_sync_thread()` could lead to a deadlock as shown by commit 130443d60b1b.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability could lead to:
- Data corruption due to unsynchronized access to shared resources.
- System instability.
- Potential deadlock.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending specific messages to the device mapper RAID target, specifically the "frozen" or "idle" messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send messages to a dm-raid target to trigger the vulnerable code path. This is typically achieved through a privileged process or an administrator with access to the device mapper interface.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented by commit `cd32b27a66db8776d8b8e82ec7d7dde97a8693b0` replaces the direct call to `md_reap_sync_thread()` with `stop_sync_thread()`, which is the correct way to unregister the sync thread. It also introduces locking around `md_frozen_sync_thread()` and `md_idle_sync_thread()` calls using `mddev_lock()` and `mddev_unlock()` to protect critical sections and avoid the race condition.
