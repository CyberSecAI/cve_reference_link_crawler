Crypto wallets implementing the GG18 or GG20 TSS protocol might allow an attacker to extract a full ECDSA private key by injecting a malicious pallier key and cheating in the range proof. Depending on the Beta parameters chosen in the protocol implementation, the attack might require 16 signatures or more fully exfiltrate the other parties' private key shares.
