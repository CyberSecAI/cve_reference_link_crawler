{
  "CVE-2023-33241": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability was found at the pseudocode level, and all vendors implementing the protocol should be considered vulnerable. The vulnerability can be exploited to exfiltrate the key.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability originates with parties not checking to see if the attackerâ€™s Paillier modulus, denoted N, has small factors or that it is a biprime.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of validation of Paillier modulus for small prime factors.",
       "Vulnerable implementations of GG18 and GG20 MPC protocols."
    ],
    "Impact": "If exploited, the vulnerability allows a threat actor interacting with the signatories in the MPC protocol to steal their secret shards and ultimately obtain the master secret key, leading to full private key extraction and loss of funds.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously-crafted messages to obtain leakage of the private key shards.",
      "Compromise of a signatory and interaction for the entire MPC protocol with maliciously-crafted messages."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to interact with the signatories of the MPC protocol, or compromise a signatory. In some cases, no malicious messages need to be crafted and a transcript of the signature ceremony suffices to extract the key.",
    "Additional Details": [
        "The severity of the vulnerability depends on implementation parameters, with some implementations vulnerable to key extraction in 16 signatures, while others require up to 1 billion signatures.",
        "Two main cases are identified based on the beta parameter in MTA. In case 1, the key can be extracted in 16 signatures. In case 2, an attacker controls one of the signatories and can extract the key after 200k to 1 billion signatures depending on the modulus.",
         "A specific sub-scenario of Case1 was identified in the Apache Milagro library which had an extremely low beta parameter (256 bits) allowing an attacker to extract the key without crafting any malicious messages and simply recovering the key from the transcript of the signature ceremony."
