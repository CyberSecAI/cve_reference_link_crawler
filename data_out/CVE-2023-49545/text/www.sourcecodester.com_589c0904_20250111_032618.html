**Project: Customer Support System using PHP/MySQLi**

## **About**

The Customer Support System is a simple project that can help a certain business or company that provides customer support after their customer purchased a product from them. In this system, the customer and staff can communicate about the issue or instances that occurred in the purchased product. In this feature, the customer can create a ticket for any problems that occurred to their purchased product then the support staff under the department what did the customer or admin choose to fix the problem. The system has 3 types of users which are the admin, support staff, and the customer. Only admin users can create new access for the customer and support staff. Talking about the communication between the customer and the support staff, the system has a comment section in each ticket so the users can leave their comments on the specific ticket to communicate with each other.
