Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Relative Path Traversal** issue. This means that the affected software (DCMTK, specifically the Service Class User (SCU) component) does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software allows an attacker to use relative path specifiers (e.g., `../`, `../../`) when specifying the destination directory for writing DICOM files. This could allow the attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write DICOM files to arbitrary locations on the file system, which could include directories where they should not have write access.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By writing malicious files into the file system, the attacker can potentially achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Adjacent:** The attack vector is adjacent network access, meaning that an attacker must be on the same local network or have access to the target systemâ€™s network.
*   **DICOM File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the vulnerable SCU component of DCMTK processes a DICOM file received from the attacker, which can contain maliciously crafted file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected system.
*   **Ability to Send Malicious DICOM files:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious DICOM files to a vulnerable system running DCMTK.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details**
* The affected product is DCMTK, specifically the SCU component
* The CVSS v3 base score is 7.5. The CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). This translates to:
    * Attack Vector: Adjacent
    * Attack Complexity: High
    * Privileges Required: None
    * User Interaction: None
    * Scope: Unchanged
    * Confidentiality: High
    * Integrity: High
    * Availability: High
* The vulnerability is present in all DCMTK versions prior to 3.6.7
* The vulnerability was reported by Noam Moshe of Claroty to CISA.
