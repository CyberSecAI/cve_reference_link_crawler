Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Relative Path Traversal** issue in the affected product's Service Class User (SCU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The software does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided file paths, allowing an attacker to use relative path sequences (e.g., "../", "..\\") to access directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write DICOM files into arbitrary directories on the system, using controlled names.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to write arbitrary files can be leveraged for remote code execution by placing malicious executables or configuration files in locations where they will be executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable over an adjacent network.
*   The attack targets the Service Class User (SCU) component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to the vulnerable system.
*   No special privileges or user interaction is required (PR:N/UI:N)
*   Low attack complexity is required (AC:H)

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** DCMTK versions prior to 3.6.7.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to DCMTK version 3.6.7 or later.
