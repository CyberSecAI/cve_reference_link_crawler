[#### LiteSpeed Cache

Unauthenticated Account Takeover](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/litespeed-cache/wordpress-litespeed-cache-plugin-6-5-0-1-unauthenticated-account-takeover-vulnerability)

This blog post is about the LiteSpeed plugin vulnerability. If you’re a LiteSpeed user, please update the plugin to at least version **6.5.0.1**.

**If you are a [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/pricing/) customer, you are protected from this vulnerability already**, and no further action is required from you.

Patchstack is the [official security partner for LiteSpeed Cache](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/litespeed-cache). Patchstack is helping with coordinated vulnerability disclosure and patch validation. If you’re a plugin developer and wish to improve the security of your product, [consider setting you your own security program for free.](https://patchstack.com/for-plugins/)

## **About the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin**

The plugin [LiteSpeed Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/) (free version), which has over **5 million** active installations, is known as the most popular caching plugin in the WordPress ecosystem.

![](https://patchstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-13-1024x332.png)

This WordPress plugin is an all-in-one site acceleration plugin, featuring an exclusive server-level cache and a collection of optimization features. The plugin supports WordPress Multisite and is compatible with the most popular plugins, including WooCommerce, bbPress, and Yoast SEO.

## **The security vulnerability**

The plugin suffers from an unauthenticated account takeover vulnerability which allows any unauthenticated visitor to gain authentication access to any logged-in users and at worst can gain access to an Administrator level role after which malicious plugins could be uploaded and installed. This vulnerability was discovered as a result of a deeper technical analysis of previously discovered [Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation](https://patchstack.com/articles/critical-privilege-escalation-in-litespeed-cache-plugin-affecting-5-million-sites/) in the same plugin by our alliance member **[John Blackbourn](https://patchstack.com/database/researcher/185b44a7-75e2-4c31-848d-a534cb44e821)**. In the previous report, we noticed that the hash could also be leaked from a debug log file and we decided to check other possible information leaks on the debug log file.

The vulnerability exploits an HTTP response headers leak on the debug log file which also leaks the **“Set-Cookie”** header after the users perform a login request. The vulnerability has been assigned **CVE-2024-44000** and was fixed in version **6.5.0.1** of the plugin.

The main vulnerable code exists on the function `ended`:

```
/**
	* End call of one request process
	* @since 4.7
	* @access public
	*/
public static function ended()
{
	self::debug('Response headers', headers_list());

	$elapsed_time = number_format((microtime(true) - LSCWP_TS_0) * 1000, 2);
	self::debug("End response\n--------------------------------------------------Duration: " . $elapsed_time . " ms------------------------------\n");
}
```

This function will simply call a **self::debug()** function with **[headers\_list()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.headers-list.php)** data as the debug data parameter. According to the official documentation, the **[headers\_list()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.headers-list.php)** function will return a list of response headers sent (or ready to send). This indicates that the plugin will include all of the HTTP response headers to the debug data, including the HTTP response header of Set-Cookie that is triggered when users log in to the WordPress site.

The **ended** function itself is called from the **send\_headers\_force** function which will be triggered from the **init** hook. We also notice on the plugin setting, there is a feature to **Log Cookies**. This feature could also leak users request cookie if it’s enabled:

```
private function _init_request($log_file = null)
{
	if (!$log_file) {
		$log_file = self::$log_path;
	}

	// Check log file size
	$log_file_size = $this->conf(Base::O_DEBUG_FILESIZE);
	if (file_exists($log_file) && filesize($log_file) > $log_file_size * 1000000) {
		File::save($log_file, '');
	}

	// For more than 2s's requests, add more break
	if (file_exists($log_file) && time() - filemtime($log_file) > 2) {
		File::append($log_file, "\n\n\n\n");
	}

	if (PHP_SAPI == 'cli') {
		return;
	}

	$servervars = array(
		'Query String' => '',
		'HTTP_ACCEPT' => '',
		'HTTP_USER_AGENT' => '',
		'HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING' => '',
		'HTTP_COOKIE' => '',
		'REQUEST_METHOD' => '',
		'SERVER_PROTOCOL' => '',
		'X-LSCACHE' => '',
		'LSCACHE_VARY_COOKIE' => '',
		'LSCACHE_VARY_VALUE' => '',
		'ESI_CONTENT_TYPE' => '',
	);
	$server = array_merge($servervars, $_SERVER);
	$params = array();

	if (isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] == 'on') {
		$server['SERVER_PROTOCOL'] .= ' (HTTPS) ';
	}

	$param = sprintf('💓 ------%s %s %s', $server['REQUEST_METHOD'], $server['SERVER_PROTOCOL'], strtok($server['REQUEST_URI'], '?'));

	$qs = !empty($server['QUERY_STRING']) ? $server['QUERY_STRING'] : '';
	if ($this->conf(Base::O_DEBUG_COLLAPSE_QS)) {
		$qs = $this->_omit_long_message($qs);
		if ($qs) {
			$param .= ' ? ' . $qs;
		}
		$params[] = $param;
	} else {
		$params[] = $param;
		$params[] = 'Query String: ' . $qs;
	}

	if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) {
		$params[] = 'HTTP_REFERER: ' . $this->_omit_long_message($server['HTTP_REFERER']);
	}

	if (defined('LSCWP_LOG_MORE')) {
		$params[] = 'User Agent: ' . $this->_omit_long_message($server['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
		$params[] = 'Accept: ' . $server['HTTP_ACCEPT'];
		$params[] = 'Accept Encoding: ' . $server['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'];
	}
	if ($this->conf(Base::O_DEBUG_COOKIE)) {
		$params[] = 'Cookie: ' . $server['HTTP_COOKIE'];
	}
	if (isset($_COOKIE['_lscache_vary'])) {
		$params[] = 'Cookie _lscache_vary: ' . $_COOKIE['_lscache_vary'];
	}
	if (defined('LSCWP_LOG_MORE')) {
		$params[] = 'X-LSCACHE: ' . (!empty($server['X-LSCACHE']) ? 'true' : 'false');
	}
	if ($server['LSCACHE_VARY_COOKIE']) {
		$params[] = 'LSCACHE_VARY_COOKIE: ' . $server['LSCACHE_VARY_COOKIE'];
	}
	if ($server['LSCACHE_VARY_VALUE']) {
		$params[] = 'LSCACHE_VARY_VALUE: ' . $server['LSCACHE_VARY_VALUE'];
	}
	if ($server['ESI_CONTENT_TYPE']) {
		$params[] = 'ESI_CONTENT_TYPE: ' . $server['ESI_CONTENT_TYPE'];
	}

	$request = array_map(__CLASS__ . '::format_message', $params);

	File::append($log_file, $request);
}
```

Notice on the function, if **$this->conf(Base::O\_DEBUG\_COOKIE)** value is set, then the **$server[‘HTTP\_COOKIE’]** value will be appended to the **$params[]** and it will be written to the debug log file.

Note that this vulnerability can only be exploited with these certain conditions:

* Active debug log feature on the LiteSpeed Cache plugin.
* Has activated the debug log feature once before (not currently active now) and the **/wp-content/debug.log** file is not purged or removed.

## The patch

Since this vulnerability exists because the code tries to include sensitive response header and request cookie data, the LiteSpeed team decided to apply these valid additional protections:

* Moved the debug log file to the LiteSpeed individual folder at **/wp-content/litespeed/debug/**.
* Used random string for log filenames that consist of a substring of MD5 hash value of **AUTH\_KEY** substring.
* Dropped Log Cookies option on the debug log feature.
* Removed cookies-related info from the response headers.
* Added a dummy **index.php** file inside of the new dedicated debug directory.

The full patch can be seen in this [changeset](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3146657/litespeed-cache/trunk).

Additional recommendations that can be made to make the debug log feature more secure:

* Apply a proper .htaccess rule to deny direct access to the new log file. The LiteSpeed team already tried to apply a .htaccess rule on the patch, however, the rule implemented is still not proper, and users are still able to directly access the new log file if the users know the new log file name.
* Perform purge or remove content on the old debug.log file so cookie data that is previously leaked can’t be accessed anymore.

A little note on the patch, we recommend users to analyze their **/wp-content/debug.log** and purge the file if the site has activated the debug feature on the LiteSpeed Cache plugin once.

## **Conclusion**

This vulnerability highlights the critical importance of ensuring the security of performing a debug log process, what data should not be logged, and how the debug log file is managed. In general, we highly do not recommend a plugin or theme to log sensitive data related to authentication into the debug log file. We also highly recommend the plugin and theme developer to properly store their debug log data inside of a secure debug log file with a decently random log filename and additional .htaccess rule to block direct access.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
