### @andreslucena **[andreslucena](/andreslucena)** commented [Feb 26, 2024](#issue-2154165315) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

## üé© What? Why?

There's a bug in v0.27 where we don't have multiple checks to see if a space or resource should actually be embedded. This PR fixes those cases. These are:

* If a space or resource is unpublished
* If a space or resource is moderated and hidden
* If a space or resource is withdrawn. Even though is still visible, it should not be available
* If a space is private, with the exception being if the space is transparent
* In the case of Initiatives, as their visibility depends on their state, we take into account that for allowing access or not

This also prevents another bug where an embed page could be leaked between Organizations in the multitenant installation

As this feature isn't anymore in v0.28, I'm doing the PR directly against the version that has this feature (and this bug).

## Testing

The blueprint for all the checks is actually the same 2 steps in the end

### Publication

1. Copy the URL for embedding an Assembly
2. Unpublish it
3. See that you can access to this URL (without this patch)
4. See that you can't access to this URL and you can't see the button (with this patch)

### Moderation

1. Copy the URL for embedding a Proposal
2. Report and hide it

### Withdraw

1. Copy the URL for embedding a Proposal that you've created
2. Withdraw it

### Private

1. Copy the URL for embedding an Assembly
2. Make it private and not transparent
3. It should not be visible

### Private transparent

1. Copy the URL for embedding an Assembly
2. Make it private and transparent
3. It should be visible

### Initiatives

1. Create an initiative
2. See that you don't have the embed link
3. As an admin, validate it so it is in the "published" state
4. See that you have the embed likn

‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you!

### **[andreslucena](/andreslucena)** commented [Mar 1, 2024](#issuecomment-1972715995)

| [@alecslupu](https://github.com/alecslupu) I think all your suggestions were handled. Apart from that, it's worth mentioning one other change.  We need to check if the Embed link is there, as if not we would have another bug: I have the embed link, but it doesn't work when embedding (as the permissions is preventing me for actually seeing them). Related to this, there are a couple spaces/resources (like `Decidim::Consultation`, `Decidim::Consultations::Question` and `Decidim::Conference`) that even though had the feature developed, they didn't have this link. As they don't have an obvious place to add them (i.e. their layouts don't have a sidebar), then I leave that out of this PR. Mind that even though they don't have the link, they could still be leaked by adding the "/embed" in the URL |

I have checked, and i would do some small changes so that we ensure the consistency across hidden, published and o other variations.

I would expect that when you access a resource that is not supposed to be visible, then always we get either 404 or a redirect. Currently we have a mix of the variations.
