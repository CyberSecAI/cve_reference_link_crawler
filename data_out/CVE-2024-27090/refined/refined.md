Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-27090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of sufficient checks when embedding resources (like Participatory Processes, Assemblies, Proposals, etc.). The application did not properly verify if a resource should be embedded based on its publication status, moderation, withdrawal, or privacy settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system lacked proper authorization checks for embedded resources, allowing unauthorized access to content that should have been restricted.
- **Data Leakage:** The embed feature could expose data from unpublished, moderated, withdrawn, or private resources if an attacker knew the resource's slug or URL.
- **Multi-tenancy Issue**: The embed feature could leak data between organizations in a multi-tenant installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from resources that were meant to be private or not yet published.
- **Data Exposure:** Information about moderated or withdrawn content could be revealed through the embed feature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker could directly access the embed URL of a resource if they knew or could guess the URL. This URL typically ends with `/embed.html`.
- **Information Inference:** The attacker needs to infer or know the resource's slug or URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Resource Slugs/URLs:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the target resource.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability could be exploited without requiring authentication.
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.27.6 of the `decidim` application
- The fix involves adding checks to verify if a resource is published, not private or withdrawn before it is allowed to be embedded. It also prevents the embed page from being leaked between organizations in multitenant installations.
- The fix ensures a consistent 404 response when a resource is not supposed to be visible via embed
- A workaround was suggested which is to disallow access to URLs ending with `/embed.html` through web server configuration.
