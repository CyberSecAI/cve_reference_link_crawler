- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect Server is vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack when using SESSIONSECURITY=TRANSITIONAL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Offline dictionary attack vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access by cracking user passwords via an offline dictionary attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Offline dictionary attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or obtain password hashes or other authentication data. The attacker would then perform a dictionary attack using this data.
