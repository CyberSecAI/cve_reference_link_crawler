Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation and sanitization when processing user-provided data within the `tac_plus` daemon. Specifically, the daemon takes values from the incoming TACACS+ packet (like the remote address) and directly substitutes them into a command string that is later executed via `/bin/sh -c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the string passed to `/bin/sh -c` due to the lack of sanitization of input fields from the TACACS+ packet.
*   **Unsafe Variable Substitution:** The process of replacing variables like `$user`, `$name`, and `$address` in the `before authorization` command string is done without proper checks.
*   **Use of `popen()`:** The usage of `popen()` and subsequently `execl()` with `/bin/sh -c` to execute user controlled strings makes exploitation possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the vulnerable `tac_plus` daemon. This can lead to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **System takeover:** By injecting commands, an attacker can achieve complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **TACACS+ Packets:** The attack vector is through crafted TACACS+ packets, specifically by exploiting the remote address field (`rem_addr`). Other input fields might be exploitable, but the example uses `rem_addr`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the `tac_plus` server to send crafted TACACS+ packets.
*   **Understanding of TACACS+:**  The attacker needs to understand the TACACS+ protocol structure to craft malicious packets with the payload in the `rem_addr` field or other exploitable fields.
*   **Valid Username:**  A username configured with a `before authorization` or `after authorization` directive must be used in the attack (no password is required).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple forks of the `tac_plus` codebase, including those based on an old Cisco dev kit, as well as forks used by Shrubbery Networks and Facebook.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the authorization process, specifically within the `pre_authorization()` function, after the initial check of username existence.
*   The provided example demonstrates how to trigger a reverse shell using a crafted `rem_addr` field in a TACACS+ packet.
*   The content provides a list of Linux distributions that are known to be affected by this vulnerability through their packages.
*   The vulnerability is associated with both CVE-2023-45239 (Facebook's fork) and CVE-2023-48643 (Shrubbery Networks' fork) as they share the same underlying vulnerability.
