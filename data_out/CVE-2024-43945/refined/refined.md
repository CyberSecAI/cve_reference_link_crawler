  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LatePoint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This vulnerability allows an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the website while they are authenticated.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, potentially leading to unauthorized changes, data manipulation, or other harmful activities within the WordPress site. Specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out through a malicious website, email, blog, instant message, or program, that forces a user's web browser to send a forged HTTP request to a vulnerable web site. The victim needs to be logged in to the vulnerable application for the attack to be successful.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to a malicious website, or use another method to force their browser to send a forged request. The attacker does not require any authentication themselves."
