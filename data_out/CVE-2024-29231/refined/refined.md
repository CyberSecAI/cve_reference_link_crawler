- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of array index.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `UserPrivilege.Enum` webapi component in Synology Surveillance Station does not properly validate array indices, leading to a security bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass security constraints.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed via unspecified vectors over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user.
