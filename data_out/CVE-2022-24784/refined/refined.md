Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from the ability to filter users based on their password hashes via the REST API. Specifically, by using specially crafted regular expressions in the users endpoint, an attacker could probe the hash character by character. The API's response would indicate if a character at a specific position in the hash was correct by returning a result (or not).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The system allowed attackers to incrementally discover password hashes by crafting specific regular expression filters.  Even though the hash itself wasn't returned in the response, the presence or absence of a response allowed attackers to confirm the presence of a character at a specific position of the hash.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The API did not properly sanitize or validate the regular expression filters applied to the user's password hashes allowing attackers to use this to their advantage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially reconstruct a user's password hash over time by sending many requests. The attacker would not retrieve the actual user password.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability was exploitable through the REST API by sending HTTP requests with crafted regular expressions as filters.
- **API Endpoint:** The specific vulnerable endpoint was the `/users` endpoint in the REST API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **REST API Access:** The attacker needed access to the REST API. Note that this API is disabled by default, as well as the users endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Regular Expressions:** The attacker needed to have a knowledge of how to craft regular expressions.
- **Ability to send multiple requests:** The attacker would need to send multiple requests to reconstruct the hash character by character. The API had request throttling enabled by default, so this process would have been slow.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the filtering by password or password hash, preventing the attack vector completely.
- The vulnerability was reported by Thibaud Kehler
- The vulnerability is considered Low severity.
