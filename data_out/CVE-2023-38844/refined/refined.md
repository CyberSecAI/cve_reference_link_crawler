Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-38844:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure SQL query in the `/devel/export_skos.php` file. Specifically, the `$numt` variable, which is directly derived from the user-supplied `thesaurus` GET parameter, is concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `thesaurus` parameter.
*   **Unsafe Concatenation:** The direct concatenation of user-controlled input into a SQL query is the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including session identifiers, by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By extracting session IDs, attackers can potentially impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/devel/export_skos.php` endpoint, including a malicious SQL injection payload in the `thesaurus` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PMB instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This is a pre-authentication vulnerability, meaning an attacker does not need prior valid credentials to exploit it.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$numt = $_GET["thesaurus"];
(...)
$res = pmb_mysql_query("select * from thesaurus where id_thesaurus=".$numt);
$rt = pmb_mysql_fetch_object($res);
```
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with a boolean-based SQL injection, as demonstrated by the following examples:
    *   **True Condition:** `http://host/devel/export_skos.php?tname=%0a&prefix=&thesaurus=1%20or%201=1`
    *   **False Condition:** `http://host/devel/export_skos.php?tname=%0a&prefix=&thesaurus=1%20or%201=2`
*   The provided content includes a Python script to exploit the vulnerability, using a union-based SQL injection technique to extract session identifiers.
