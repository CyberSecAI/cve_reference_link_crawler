- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts on the Telnet port of FortiTester.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-307, which is an improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts. The system lacks proper controls to prevent brute-force attacks on the Telnet service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can potentially guess the credentials of an admin user through a brute-force attack. Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based brute-force attacks targeting the Telnet port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FortiTester device and the ability to send Telnet authentication requests. No prior authentication is needed to attempt the attack.
