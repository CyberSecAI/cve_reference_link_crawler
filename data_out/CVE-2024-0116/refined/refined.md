- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of shared memory regions. A user can trigger an out-of-bounds read by releasing a shared memory region while it's still in use.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), requires high privileges (PR:H) , and no user interaction (UI:N), the scope is unchanged (S:U), with no impact to confidentiality (C:N), no impact to integrity (I:N), but high impact to availability (A:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges to be able to release shared memory regions.
