- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The cryptographic algorithm used by IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) to encrypt and decrypt application data uses a JSON web token (JWT) signing key that is shorter than the recommended length.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a relatively weak cryptographic algorithm with an insufficiently short JWT signing key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The use of a shorter than recommended key could potentially allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the application data.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who has access to the encrypted application data and attempts to decrypt it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to the encrypted data and the ability to perform cryptographic attacks to exploit the weakness.
