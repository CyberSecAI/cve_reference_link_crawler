View of the UTM software version 12.6

### **UTM firewalls offer network security at its best**

Securepoint UTM firewalls are the all-in-one solution for IT security. They combine firewall, router and Unified Threat Management (UTM) in one device as well as hardware, software, service and support in one licence. Guaranteed without backdoors, but including the popular Securepoint VPN client. The UTM firewall is the heart of the unified security concept.

## UTM firewall features

* Secure surfing and working thanks to content filter
* Block dangerous IP addresses and prioritise data packets
* Exclude certain regions of the world with geo-IP blocking
* Detect and filter ransomware and viruses
* Virus Outbreak Detection
* Centralised management via our cloud-based Unified Security Console
* Our 'Cyber Defence Cloud' bundles 12 cloud services in our UTM firewalls
* Machine learning, swarm intelligence and data analysis ensure a high level of data evaluation
[Download the UTM Firewalls brochure](/fileadmin/securepoint/allgemein/downloads/pdfs/produkte/utm-firewall/utm-firewall-securepoint-english.pdf)[Firewall functions - all the details](/en/for-companies/utm-firewall/firewall-functions)![Title of the prospect for Securepoint UTM Firewall.](/fileadmin/_processed_/d/1/csm_prospekt-titelbild-utm-firewall-english_726a5466c2.jpg "Prospect for Securepoint UTM Firewall")
## Virus Outbreak Detection

Virus Outbreak Detection offers effective protection against unknown threats. As part of the spam filter of our firewalls, it recognises new viruses within a short time of their first appearance on the network - usually more than twelve hours earlier than conventional signature-based virus scanners.

This shorter time between the appearance of a new virus and the necessary adaptation of virus scanners is a huge advantage in the defence against threats. Virus Outbreak Detection enables optimum virus protection through faster response times!

## Whether you buy or rent: We have your UTM firewall

Whether it's the small Black Dwarf for 10 users or the RC1000R for up to 1,000 users - we offer all UTM firewalls in various subscription models to suit your needs and requirements: for purchase, for flexible rental, as a managed service or virtually.

[All UTM hardware models at a glance](/en/for-companies/utm-firewall/hardware-firewalls)[All the details about your "Firewall as a Service"](/en/for-partners/managed-service/firewall-as-a-service)

As a small or medium-sized company, you can benefit from a UTM firewall as a security centre. By using the various protection functions, you can protect yourself against all kinds of threats and reduce the digital attack surface.

## FAQ about UTM-Firewall

### What is a UTM firewall?

UTM stands for Unified Threat Management. Classic firewalls protect by releasing and blocking IP addresses and ports that are needed for communication with the internet. The level of IT security is comparatively low. Modern UTM firewalls take on a multitude of security tasks to guarantee your network security.

### What are the functions of a UTM firewall?

UTM firewalls usually combine at least the following functions:

* Firewall
* VPN gateway
* Internet gateway
* Spam protection
* Virus protection
* Content-Filter
* Endpoint protection and surf protection
* Authentication
* Intrusion Detection System
* Reporting
### Why does your company need a firewall?

Cyber criminals are very active and are expanding their activities. For 2021, the Federal Criminal Police Office recorded an increase of over 12% compared to 20201. The detection rate is only 30%. If an attack succeeds, production and operations can fail. Any damage to the company's image because customer data was stolen has a long-term effect. Depending on the corporate structure, the personal liability of the persons involved also plays a role. The damage caused in Germany is already in the billions - and rising.

The quality and quantity of DDoS attacks, malware or social engineering attacks are increasing. Simple firewalls or security functions of the operating system or router do not offer sufficient protection. The heart of IT security in the company is a UTM firewall.

1 Quelle: CyberCrime Bundeslagebericht 2021, Bundeskriminalamt, Stand: 09.05.2022, [www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/Lagebilder/Cybercrime/cybercrime\_node.html](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/Lagebilder/Cybercrime/cybercrime_node.html)

### What are the advantages of a UTM firewall for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)?

The combinable options make UTM firewalls all-rounders in IT security. Thus, the UTM firewall for SMEs becomes the heart of IT security. They monitor and control data traffic when surfing and sending e-mails, manage roles and rights in the network and enable the secure connection of remote workstations or branch offices to the company network. Management and updates are carried out centrally.
