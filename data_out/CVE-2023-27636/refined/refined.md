Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-27636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the backend of the Sitefinity CMS, specifically in features utilizing the SF-Editor. The root cause lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when using the SF-Editor, which allows malicious HTML and JavaScript code to be saved and executed when a victim accesses the affected page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied HTML in the SF-Editor.
- Lack of output encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a victim with higher privileges visits a page containing the stored XSS payload, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Cookie theft.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim with their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated attacker with lower privileges.
- The attacker injects a malicious XSS payload via the SF-Editor.
- The payload is stored in the CMS's database or content store.
- When a higher privileged user accesses the affected page, the stored payload is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the Sitefinity CMS with lower privileges.
- The attacker must be able to access and modify content through the SF-Editor.
- The attacker does not need any special or high privileges to carry out the attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The identified payload used to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability is: `<iframe src="javascript:alert(document.domain);">` (although the Exploit-DB entry mentions `<noalert><iframe src="javascript:alert(document.domain);">`). This payload executes a JavaScript alert box displaying the document domain when triggered.
- The vulnerability exists in all features using the SF-Editor in versions of Sitefinity CMS prior to 15.0.0.
- The fix was implemented in Sitefinity CMS version 15.0.0.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit requires a victim with higher privileges to visit the page to trigger the XSS.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in at the same time as the victim.
- The vulnerability is a *stored* XSS, not *reflected*.
