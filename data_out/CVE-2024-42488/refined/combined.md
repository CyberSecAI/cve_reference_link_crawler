# Policy bypass for Host Firewall policy due to race condition in Cilium agent

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-q7w8-72mr-vpgw
Aug 15, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

< 1.14.14
>= 1.15.0, < 1.15.8

## Patched versions

1.14.14
1.15.8

## Description

### Impact

A race condition in the Cilium agent can cause the agent to ignore labels that should be applied to a node. This could in turn cause CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicies intended for nodes with the ignored label to not apply, leading to policy bypass.

### Patches

This issue was fixed in [#33511](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33511).

This issue affects:

* All versions of Cilium before v1.14.14
* Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.7 inclusive

This issue has been patched in:

* Cilium v1.14.14
* Cilium v1.15.8

### Workarounds

As the underlying issue depends on a race condition, users unable to upgrade can restart the Cilium agent on affected nodes until the affected policies are confirmed to be working as expected.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Google and Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@skmatti](https://github.com/skmatti) for raising and resolving this issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).

If you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @skmatti **[skmatti](/skmatti)** commented [Jul 1, 2024](#issue-2384403073) • edited Loading

This fixes a race condition during agent startup that causes the k8s node label updates to not get propagated to the host endpoint.

The current endpoint label update logic rejects a request if any of the labels on the old node are not present in the endpoint manager state.

For host endpoints, the k8s node label add/update events may be missed if the k8s node watcher initializes before the host endpoint is created. As a result, the host endpoint labels are outdated, and all subsequent node label updates are rejected due to the aforementioned precondition check.

To resolve the issue, this commit updates the old labels only if the current node label update is successfully propagated to the endpoint manager.

Fixes [#29649](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/29649)

| [@skmatti](https://github.com/skmatti) It looks like the patch did not apply cleanly. Would you be open to preparing a port of the change onto the v1.15 branch?  I've also tagged it for v1.14 as I think that makes sense given that this can impact the labels associated with the host. |

| Yeah, this definitely affects all the versions. I can open a change against 1.15. The backport to 1.14 and 1.13 will be slightly different as there are node watch logic changed between 1.14 and 1.15. |

Track node labels propagated to the endpoint manager correctly

```
This fixes a race condition during agent startup
where k8s node label updates are rejected
indefinitely by the host endpoint.

The current endpoint label update logic rejects
a request if any of the labels on the old node
are not present in the endpoint manager state.

For host endpoints, the k8s node label add/update
events may be missed if the k8s node watcher
initializes before the host endpoint is created.
As a result, the host endpoint labels are outdated,
and all subsequent node label updates are rejected
due to the aforementioned precondition check.

To resolve the issue, this commit updates the old
labels only if the current node label update is
successfully propagated to the endpoint manager.

Fixes [#29649](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/29649)
