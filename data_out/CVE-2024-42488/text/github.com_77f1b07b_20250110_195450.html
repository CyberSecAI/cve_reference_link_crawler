### @skmatti **[skmatti](/skmatti)** commented [Jul 1, 2024](#issue-2384403073) • edited Loading

This fixes a race condition during agent startup that causes the k8s node label updates to not get propagated to the host endpoint.

The current endpoint label update logic rejects a request if any of the labels on the old node are not present in the endpoint manager state.

For host endpoints, the k8s node label add/update events may be missed if the k8s node watcher initializes before the host endpoint is created. As a result, the host endpoint labels are outdated, and all subsequent node label updates are rejected due to the aforementioned precondition check.

To resolve the issue, this commit updates the old labels only if the current node label update is successfully propagated to the endpoint manager.

Fixes [#29649](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/29649)

| [@skmatti](https://github.com/skmatti) It looks like the patch did not apply cleanly. Would you be open to preparing a port of the change onto the v1.15 branch?  I've also tagged it for v1.14 as I think that makes sense given that this can impact the labels associated with the host. |

| I realized I'm actually not sure whether this affects 1.13/.14. Let me know if you figure that out and I can set the labels appropriately. |

| Yeah, this definitely affects all the versions. I can open a change against 1.15. The backport to 1.14 and 1.13 will be slightly different as there are node watch logic changed between 1.14 and 1.15. |
