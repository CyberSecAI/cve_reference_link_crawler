- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) is designed to process information from any server using GET and POST requests, which allows for Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to the WPS's ability to process information from any server using GET/POST requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, data leakage, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted requests to the WPS to initiate requests to arbitrary URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges and no user interaction is required. The attacker needs to have network access to the GeoServer instance. The WPS extension must be installed, the "Disable complex inputs" setting must be unselected, and security URL checks must be disabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
