Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `Reports` module of VTiger CRM v7.5.0. Specifically, when creating a report, the selected fields are not properly sanitized or checked against a whitelist. The application uses a colon-separated string to represent fields, which is split using the `explode` function. However, the validation process only checks the fourth element in the split array against permitted fields for non-admin users, while the table and column names (the first two elements) are not validated at all.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Second-order SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a second-order SQL injection because the malicious SQL parameters are initially stored and then reintroduced when the report is run.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the table and column names provided in the user input, leading to arbitrary database access.
- **Misplaced Validation Logic:** The validation check targets the wrong part of the input string (`selectedfields[3]`), while ignoring the critical table and column names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak arbitrary data from the database, including sensitive information like:
    - User password hashes
    - Web service API access keys
    - Other potentially sensitive data stored in the database

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the Reports module.
- **Report Creation:** The attack involves creating or editing a report and manipulating the `selected_fields` parameter during report saving.
- **Proxy Interception:** An attacker would need to intercept the request with a proxy tool like Burp Suite to modify the `selected_fields` parameter before submitting it.
- **SQL Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL by manipulating the `sql_table` and `sql_column` values in the `selected_fields` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the VTiger CRM with access to the Reports module.
- They require the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
- No specific admin privileges are required to exploit the SQL injection itself, however, admin users may have additional access or capabilities.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including a step-by-step Proof of Concept (PoC) and the code where the vulnerability occurs (ReportRun.php).
- The fix involves validating table and column names against hardcoded, allowed fields for each module to prevent unauthorized data access.
