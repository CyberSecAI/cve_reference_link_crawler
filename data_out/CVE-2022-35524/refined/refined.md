In summary, the identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected WAVLINK routers via multiple web interfaces and CGI scripts by injecting commands into various parameters.  The common theme across these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization. These vulnerabilities require the attacker to be able to make http requests to the router's web interface, often requiring prior login to the administrative interface. The login.shtml vulnerability can be exploited without login.
