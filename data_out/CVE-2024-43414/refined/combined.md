# Query Plans

Learn how your router orchestrates operations across subgraphs

---

Learn more about query plans to help you optimize and debug advanced use cases of Apollo Federation.

## Example graph

Let's say our federated supergraph includes these subgraphs:

GraphQLHotels subgraph copy
```
1type Hotel @key(fields: "id") {
2  id: ID!
3  address: String!
4}
5
6type Query {
7  hotels: [Hotel!]!
8}
```
GraphQLReviews subgraph copy
```
1type Hotel @key(fields: "id") {
2  id: ID! @external
3  reviews: [Review!]!
4}
5
6type Review {
7  id: ID!
8  rating: Int!
9  description: String!
10}
```

Based on these subgraphs, clients can execute the following query against our router:

GraphQL copy
```
1query GetHotels {
2  hotels { # Resolved by Hotels subgraph
3    id
4    address
5    reviews { # Resolved by Reviews subgraph
6      rating
7    }
8  }
9}
```

This query includes fields from both the Hotels subgraph and the Reviews subgraph. Therefore, the router needs to send at least one query to each subgraph to populate all requested fields.

Take a look at the router's query plan for this query:

Click to expandGraphQL copy
```
1# Top-level definition
2QueryPlan {
3  # Indicates child nodes must be executed serially in order
4  Sequence {
5    # Execute the contained operation on the `hotels` subgraph
6    Fetch(service: "hotels") {
7      {
8        hotels {
9          id
10          address
11          __typename
12        }
13      }
14    },
15    # Merge the data from this contained Fetch with earlier data
16    # from this Sequence, at the position indicated by `path`
17    # (The @ path element indicates the previous element returns a list)
18    Flatten(path: "hotels.@") {
19      # Execute this operation on the `reviews` subgraph
20      Fetch(service: "reviews") {
21        # Use these fields as the representation of a Hotel entity
22        {
23          ... on Hotel {
24            __typename
25            id
26          }
27        } => # Populate these additional fields for the corresponding Hotel
28        {
29          ... on Hotel {
30            reviews {
31              rating
32            }
33          }
34        }
35      },
36    },
37  },
38}
```

This syntax probably looks confusing. ð¤ Let's break it down.

## Structure of a query plan

A query plan is defined as a hierarchy of *nodes* that looks like a JSON or GraphQL document when serialized.

At the top level of every query plan is the `QueryPlan` node:

GraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  ...
3}
```

Each node defined inside the `QueryPlan` node is one of the following:

| Node | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Fetch`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#fetch-node) | Tells the router to execute a particular operation on a particular subgraph. |
| [`Parallel`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#parallel-node) | Tells the router that the node's immediate children can be executed in parallel. |
| [`Sequence`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#sequence-node) | Tells the router that the node's immediate children must be executed serially in the order listed. |
| [`Flatten`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#flatten-node) | Tells the router to merge the data returned by this node's child `Fetch` node with data previously returned in the current `Sequence`. |
| [`Defer`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#defer-node) | Tells the router about one or more blocks of `@defer`ed fields at the same level of nesting. The node contains a primary block and an array of deferred blocks. |
| [`Skip`/`Include`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#condition-nodes) | Tells the router to split a query plan into two possible paths that can change at runtime. |

Each of these is described in further detail below.

### `Fetch` node

A `Fetch` node tells the router to execute a particular GraphQL operation on a particular subgraph. Every query plan includes at least one `Fetch` node.

GraphQL copy
```
1# Executes the query shown on the "books" subgraph
2Fetch(service: "books") {
3  {
4    books {
5      title
6      author
7    }
8  }
9},
```

The node's body is the operation to execute, and its `service` argument indicates which subgraph to execute the operation against.

In our [example graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#example-graph) above, the following query requires data only from the Hotels subgraph:

GraphQL copy
```
1query GetHotels {
2  hotels {
3    id
4    address
5  }
6}
```

Because this operation doesn't require orchestrating operations across multiple subgraphs, the entire query plan contains just a single `Fetch` node:

GraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Fetch(service: "hotels") {
3    {
4      hotels {
5        id
6        address
7      }
8    }
9  },
10}
```

The `Fetch` node uses a special syntax when it's resolving a reference to an entity across subgraphs. For details, see [Resolving references with `Flatten`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#resolving-references-with-flatten).

### `Parallel` node

A `Parallel` node tells the router that all of the node's immediate children can be executed in parallel. This node appears in query plans whenever the router can execute completely independent operations on different subgraphs.

GraphQL copy
```
1Parallel {
2  Fetch(...) {
3    ...
4  },
5  Fetch(...) {
6    ...
7  },
8  ...
9}
```

For example, let's say our federated graph has a Books subgraph and a Movies subgraph. And let's say a client executes the following query to fetch separate lists of books and movies:

GraphQL copy
```
1query GetBooksAndMovies {
2  books {
3    id
4    title
5  }
6  movies {
7    id
8    title
9  }
10}
```

In this case, the data returned by each subgraph does not depend on the data returned by any other subgraph. Therefore, the router can query both subgraphs in parallel.

The query plan for the operation looks like this:

Click to expandGraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Parallel {
3    Fetch(service: "books") {
4      {
5        books {
6          id
7          title
8        }
9      }
10    },
11    Fetch(service: "movies") {
12      {
13        movies {
14          id
15          title
16        }
17      }
18    },
19  },
20}
```
### `Sequence` node

A `Sequence` node tells the router that the node's immediate children must be executed serially in the order listed.

GraphQL copy
```
1Sequence {
2  Fetch(...) {
3    ...
4  },
5  Flatten(...) {
6    Fetch(...) {
7      ...
8    }
9  },
10  ...
11}
```

This node appears in query plans whenever one subgraph's response depends on data that first must be returned by another subgraph. This occurs most commonly when a query requests fields of an [entity](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/get-started/guides/federate-schemas#entity-overview) that are defined across multiple subgraphs.

As an example, we can return to the `GetHotels` query from our [example graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#example-graph):

GraphQL copy
```
1query GetHotels {
2  hotels { # Resolved by Hotels subgraph
3    id
4    address
5    reviews { # Resolved by Reviews subgraph
6      rating
7    }
8  }
9}
```

In our example graph, the `Hotel` type is an entity. `Hotel.id` and `Hotel.address` are resolved by the Hotels subgraph, but `Hotel.reviews` is resolved by the Reviews subgraph. And our Hotels subgraph needs to resolve first, because otherwise the Reviews subgraph doesn't know which hotels to return reviews for.

The query plan for the operation looks like this:

Click to expandGraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Sequence {
3    Fetch(service: "hotels") {
4      {
5        hotels {
6          id
7          address
8          __typename
9        }
10      }
11    },
12    Flatten(path: "hotels.@") {
13      Fetch(service: "reviews") {
14        {
15          ... on Hotel {
16            __typename
17            id
18          }
19        } =>
20        {
21          ... on Hotel {
22            reviews {
23              rating
24            }
25          }
26        }
27      },
28    },
29  },
30}
```

As shown, this query plan defines a `Sequence` that executes a `Fetch` on the Hotels subgraph before executing one on the Reviews subgraph. (We'll cover the `Flatten` node and the second `Fetch`'s special syntax next.)

### `Flatten` node

A `Flatten` node always appears inside a `Sequence` node, and it always contains a `Fetch` node. It tells the router to merge the data returned by its `Fetch` node with data that was previously `Fetch`ed during the current `Sequence`:

GraphQL copy
```
1Flatten(path: "hotels.@") {
2  Fetch(service: "reviews") {
3    ...
4  }
5}
```

The `Flatten` node's `path` argument tells the router at what position to merge the newly returned data with the existing data. An `@` element in a `path` indicates that the immediately preceding path element returns a list.

In the snippet above, the data returned by the `Flatten`'s `Fetch` is added to the `Sequence`'s existing data within the objects contained in the `hotels` list field.

#### Expanded example

Once again, let's return to the `GetHotels` query on our [example graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#example-graph):

GraphQL copy
```
1query GetHotels {
2  hotels { # Resolved by Hotels subgraph
3    id
4    address
5    reviews { # Resolved by Reviews subgraph
6      rating
7    }
8  }
9}
```

The query plan for this operation first instructs the router to execute this query on the Hotels subgraph:

GraphQL copy
```
1{
2  hotels {
3    id
4    address
5    __typename # The router requests this to resolve references (see below)
6  }
7}
```

At this point, we still need review-related information for each hotel. The query plan next instructs the router to query the Reviews subgraph for a list of `Hotel` objects that each have this structure:

GraphQL copy
```
1{
2  reviews {
3    rating
4  }
5}
```

Now, the router needs to know how to merge these `Hotel` objects with the data it already fetched from the Hotels subgraph. The `Flatten` node's `path` argument tells it exactly that:

GraphQL copy
```
1Flatten(path: "hotels.@") {
2  ...
3}
```

In other words, "Take the `Hotel` objects returned by the Reviews subgraph and merge them with the `Hotel` objects in the top-level `hotels` field returned by the first query."

When the router completes this merge, the resulting data exactly matches the structure of the client's original query:

GraphQL copy
```
1{
2  hotels {
3    id
4    address
5    reviews {
6      rating
7    }
8  }
9}
```
#### Resolving references with `Flatten`

Like `Sequence` nodes, `Flatten` nodes appear whenever one subgraph's response depends on data that first must be returned by another subgraph. This almost always involves resolving entity fields that are defined across multiple subgraphs.

In these situations, the `Flatten` node's `Fetch` needs to resolve a reference to an entity before fetching that entity's fields. When this is the case, the `Fetch` node uses a special syntax:

GraphQL copy
```
1Flatten(path: "hotels.@") {
2  Fetch(service: "reviews") {
3    {
4      ... on Hotel {
5        _typename
6        id
7      }
8    } =>
9    {
10      ... on Hotel {
11        reviews {
12          rating
13        }
14      }
15    }
16  },
17}
```

Instead of containing a GraphQL operation, this `Fetch` node contains two GraphQL fragments, separated by `=>`.

* The first fragment is a representation of the entity being resolved (in this case, `Hotel`). [Learn more about entity representations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/entities/intro/#2-define-a-reference-resolver).
* The second fragment contains the entity fields and subfields that the router needs the subgraph to resolve (in this case, `Hotel.reviews` and `Review.rating`).

When the router sees this special `Fetch` syntax, it knows to query a subgraph's [`Query._entities` field](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/subgraph-specific-fields/#query_entities). This field is what enables a subgraph to provide direct access to any available fields of an entity.

Now that you've learned about each query plan node, take another look at the example query plan in [Example graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/federation/query-plans#example-graph) to see how these nodes work together in a complete query plan.

### Defer node

A `Defer` node corresponds to one or more `@defer`s at the same level of nesting in the query plan.

The node contains a *primary block* and an array of *deferred blocks*. The primary block represents the part of the query that isn't deferred. Each deferred block corresponds to the one deferred part of the query.

Read more about how `@defer` works in the [router support for @defer article](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/operations/defer/).

GraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Defer {
3    Primary {
4      Fetch(...) {}
5    }, [
6      Deferred(...) {
7        Flatten(...) {
8          Fetch(...) {}
9        }
10      }
11    ]
12  }
13}
```
### Condition nodes

A `Skip` or `Include` node splits a query plan into an if-else branch. Condition nodes are used when an operation contains a `@skip` or `@include` directive so the query plan can select different nodes based on the provided runtime variables.

GraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Sequence {
3    Fetch(...) {}
4    Include(...) {
5      Flatten(...) {
6        Fetch(...) { }
7      }
8    }
9  }
10}
```
GraphQL copy
```
1QueryPlan {
2  Sequence {
3    Fetch(...) {}
4    Skip(...) {
5      Flatten(...) {
6        Fetch(...) { }
7      }
8    }
9  }
10}
```
## Viewing query plans

You can view the query plan for a particular operation in any of the following ways:

* [In the GraphOS Studio Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/explorer/additional-features#query-plans-for-supergraphs)

  + Note that you must publish your graph to GraphOS to view query plans in the Explorer.
* As direct output from the `@apollo/gateway` library (see below)

### Outputting query plans with headers

With [the Apollo Router Core](https://github.com/apollographql/router)

 v0.16.0+ and [`@apollo/gateway`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/api/apollo-gateway/) v2.5.4+, you can pass the following headers to return the query plans in the GraphQL response extensions:

* Including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental` header returns the query plan in the response extensions
* Additionally including the `Apollo-Query-Plan-Experimental-Format` header with one of the supported options changes the output format:

  + A value of `prettified` returns a human-readable string of the query plan
  + A value of `internal` returns a JSON representation of the query plan

### Outputting query plans with `@apollo/gateway`

Your gateway can output the query plan for each incoming operation as it's calculated. To do so, add the following to the file where you initalize your `ApolloGateway` instance:

1. Import the `serializeQueryPlan` function from the `@apollo/query-planner` library:

   JavaScript copy
   ```
   1const {serializeQueryPlan} = require('@apollo/query-planner');
   ```
2. Add the `experimental_didResolveQueryPlan` option to the object you pass to your `ApolloGateway` constructor:

   JavaScript copy
   ```
   1const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
   2  experimental_didResolveQueryPlan: function(options) {
   3    if (options.requestContext.operationName !== 'IntrospectionQuery') {
   4      console.log(serializeQueryPlan(options.queryPlan));
   5    }
   6  }
   7});
   ```

   The value you provide for this option is a function that's called every time the gateway generates a query plan. The example function above logs the generated query plan for every operation except for introspection queries (such as those sent periodically by tools like the GraphOS Studio Explorer). You can define any logic you want to log query plans or otherwise interact with them.

   For all available options passed to your function, [see the source](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/21ea8d5e028050a546bfca3c8dd092be44b1aa07/gateway-js/src/config.ts#L16-L28)

## Description

### Impact

Instances of @apollo/query-planner >=2.0.0 and <2.8.5 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability. @apollo/gateway versions >=2.0.0 and < 2.8.5 and Apollo Router <1.52.1 are also impacted through their use of @apollo/query-panner.

If @apollo/query-planner is asked to plan a sufficiently complex query, it may loop infinitely and never complete. This results in unbounded memory consumption and either a crash or out-of-memory (OOM) termination.

This issue can be triggered if you have at least one non-`@key` field that can be resolved by multiple subgraphs. To identify these shared fields, the schema for each subgraph must be reviewed. The mechanism to identify shared fields varies based on the version of Federation your subgraphs are using.

You can check if your subgraphs are using Federation 1 or Federation 2 by reviewing their schemas. Federation 2 subgraph schemas will contain a `@link` directive referencing the version of Federation being used while Federation 1 subgraphs will not. For example, in a Federation 2 subgraph, you will find a line like `@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0")`. If a similar `@link` directive is not present in your subgraph schema, it is using Federation 1. Note that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs.

**To review Federation 1 subgraphs for impact:**

In Federation 1 subgraphs, fields are implicitly shareable across subgraphs. To review for impact, you will need to review for cases where multiple subgraphs can resolve the same field. For example:

```
# Subgraph 1
type Query {
  field: Int
}

# Subgraph 2
type Query {
  field: Int
}
```

**To review Federation 2 subgraphs for impact:**

In Federation 2 subgraphs, fields must be explicitly defined as shareable across subgraphs. This is done via the `@shareable` directive. For example:

```
# Subgraph 1
@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0")
type Query {
  field: Int @shareable
}

# Subgraph 2
@link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0")
type Query {
  field: Int @shareable
}
```
### Impact Detail

This issue results from the Apollo query planner attempting to use a `Number` exceeding Javascript’s `Number.MAX_VALUE` in some cases. In Javascript, `Number.MAX_VALUE` is (2^1024 - 2^971).

When the query planner receives an inbound graphql request, it breaks the query into pieces and for each piece, generates a list of potential execution steps to solve the piece. These candidates represent the steps that the query planner will take to satisfy the pieces of the larger query. As part of normal operations, the query planner requires and calculates the number of possible query plans for the total query. That is, it needs the product of the number of query plan candidates for each piece of the query. Under normal circumstances, after generating all query plan candidates and calculating the number of all permutations, the query planner moves on to stack rank candidates and prune less-than-optimal options.

In particularly complex queries, especially those where fields can be solved through multiple subgraphs, this can cause the number of all query plan permutations to balloon. In worst-case scenarios, this can end up being a number larger than `Number.MAX_VALUE`. In Javascript, if `Number.MAX_VALUE` is exceeded, Javascript represents the value as “infinity”. If the count of candidates is evaluated as infinity, the component of the query planner responsible for pruning less-than-optimal query plans does not actually prune candidates, causing the query planner to evaluate many orders of magnitude more query plan candidates than necessary.

A given graph’s exposure to this issue varies based on its complexity. Consider the following Federation 2 subgraphs:

```
# Subgraph 1
type Query {
  field: Int @shareable
}

# Subgraph 2
type Query {
  field: Int @shareable
}
```

The query planner can solve requests for `Query.field` in one of two ways - either by querying subgraph 1 or subgraph 2.

The following query with 1024 aliased fields would trigger this issue because 2^1024 > `Number.MAX_VALUE`:

```
query {
  field_1: field
  field_2: field
  # ...
  field_1023: field
  field_1024: field
}
```

However, in a graph that provided 5 options to solve a given field, the bug could be encountered in a query that aliased the field approximately 440 times.

### Patches

@apollo/query-planner 2.8.5

@apollo/gateway 2.8.5

Apollo Router 1.52.1

### Workarounds

This issue can be avoided by ensuring there are no fields resolvable from multiple subgraphs. If all subgraphs are using Federation 2, you can confirm that you are not impacted by ensuring that none of your subgraph schemas use the `@shareable` directive. If you are using Federation 1 subgraphs, you will need to validate that there are no fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs.

Note that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs.

If you do have fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs, changing this behavior in response to this issue may be risky to the operation of your supergraph. We recommend that you update to a patched version of either Apollo Router or Apollo Gateway.

Apollo customers with an enterprise entitlement using the Apollo Router can also mitigate much of the risk from this issue by implementing [Apollo’s Persisted Queries (PQ) feature](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/persisted-queries). With PQ enabled, the Apollo Router will only execute safelisted queries. While customers would need to ensure that queries that induce this issue are not added to the safelist, PQs would mitigate the risk of clients submitting ad hoc queries that exploit this issue.

# Safelisting with Persisted Queries

Secure your graph while minimizing request latency

---

   **This feature is only available with a GraphOS Enterprise plan.** You can test it out by signing up for a free [GraphOS trial](https://studio.apollographql.com/signup?&referrer=docs-content). To compare GraphOS feature support across all plan types, see the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router).

With [GraphOS Enterprise](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing)

, you can enhance your supergraph's security by maintaining a *persisted query list* (PQL) for your GraphOS Router. To create and update the PQL, first-party apps register trusted operations to the PQL at build time.**note**Clients can register any kind of operation to a PQL, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

At runtime, the router checks incoming requests against the PQL, which can act as operation safelist, depending on your [router configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#2-router-configuration).

Your router can use its persisted query list (PQL) to both protect your supergraph and speed up your clients' operations:

* When you enable *safelisting*, your router rejects any incoming operations not registered in its PQL.
* Client apps can execute an operation by providing its PQL-specified ID instead of the entire operation string.

  + Requesting by ID can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage for large operation strings.
  + Your router can require that clients provide operations by ID and reject full operation stringsâeven operation strings present in the PQL.

## Differences from automatic persisted queries

The Apollo Router Core also supports a related feature called [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQ). With APQ, clients can execute a GraphQL operation by sending the SHA256 hash of its operation string instead of the entire string. **APQ doesn't support safelisting** because the router updates its APQ cache over time with *any* operations it receives.

For more details on differences between APQ and this feature, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries).

## Implementation

Enabling operation safelisting has a few steps:

1. PQL creation and linking
2. Router configuration
3. Operation registration
4. Client updates

This article details the router configuration step.
For more information on other configuration aspects, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).

## Router configuration

As soon as a graph variant has a linked PQL, you can configure router instances to fetch and use the PQL by following these steps:

1. Ensure your router instances are ready to work with PQLs:

   * Make sure you're using version v1.32.0 or later of the router. (The feature was released in [preview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/feature-launch-stages/#preview) in version v1.25.0 and made [generally available](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/feature-launch-stages/#general-availability) in v1.32.0.)
   * Make sure your router instances are [connected to your GraphOS Enterprise organization](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/enterprise-features/#enabling-enterprise-features) and that they're associated with a variant that your PQL is linked to.
2. Set your desired security level in your router's YAML config file. For supported options, see [router security levels](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#router-security-levels). When first implementing persisted queries, it's best to start with [auditâor "dry run"âmode](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#audit-mode-dry-run).
3. Deploy your updated router instances to begin using your PQL.

Once your organization's PQL has registered all your clients' operations and you've ensured your client apps are only sending registered operations, you can update your router configuration to the [safelisting security level](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#safelisting).

### Router security levels

The GraphOS Router supports the following security levels, in increasing order of restrictiveness:

* **Allow operation IDs**: Clients can optionally execute an operation by providing the operation's PQL-specified ID.

  + All other levels also provide this core capability.
  + This level doesn't provide safelisting.
* **Audit mode**: Executing operations by providing a PQL-specified ID is still optional, but the router also logs any unregistered operations.

  + The level serves as a dry run and helps you identify operations you may still need to register before turning on safelisting.
* **Safelisting**: The router rejects any incoming operations not present in its PQL. Requests can use either ID or operation string.

  + Before moving to this security level, ensure all your client operations are present in your PQL.
* **Safelisting with IDs only**: The router rejects any freeform GraphQL operations. Clients can only execute operations by providing their PQL-specified IDs.

  + Before moving to this security level, ensure all your clients execute operations by providing their PQL-specified ID.

When adopting persisted queries, you should start with a less restrictive security such as [audit mode](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#audit-mode-dry-run). You can then enable increasingly restrictive levels after your teams have updated all clients.

See below for sample YAML configurations for each level. Refer to the [router configuration options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#configuration-options) for option details.

**note**From version `1.25.0` to `1.32.0`, the `persisted_queries` configuration option was named `preview_persisted_queries`. Upgrade your router to version `1.32.0` or later to use the [generally available](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/feature-launch-stages/#general-availability) version of the feature and the example configuration snippets below.
#### Allow operation IDs

To use persisted queries only to reduce network bandwidth and latency (not for safelisting), add the following minimal configuration:

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
```
**note**You can use this security level with or without [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/performance/caching/in-memory#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) enabled.

This mode lets clients execute operations by providing their PQL-specified ID instead of the full operation string.
Your router also continues to accept full operation strings, even for operations that don't appear in its PQL.

#### Audit mode (dry run)

Turning on logging is crucial for gauging your client apps' readiness for safelisting. The logs identify which operations you need to either add to your PQL or stop your client apps from making.

To enable logging for unregistered queries, enable the `log_unknown` property:

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  log_unknown: true
```
**note**You can use audit mode with or without [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/performance/caching/in-memory#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) enabled.

Unregistered operations appear in your [router's logs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview).

For example:

Text copy
```
12023-08-02T11:51:59.833534Z  WARN [trace_id=5006cef73e985810eb086e5900945807] unknown operation operation_body="query ExampleQuery {\n  me {\n    id\n  }\n}\n"
```

If your router receives an operation registered in the PQL, no log message will be output.

You can use these router logs to audit operations sent to your router and ask client teams to [add new ones](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/security/persisted-queries#3-operation-registration) to your PQL if necessary.

#### Safelisting

**caution**Before applying this configuration, ensure your PQL contains all GraphQL operations that all active versions of your clients execute. If you enable safelisting without ensuring this, your router will reject any unpublished client operations.

With the following configuration, your router allows only GraphQL operations that are present in its PQL while rejecting all other operations:

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  log_unknown: true
4  safelist:
5    enabled: true
6    require_id: false
7apq:
8  enabled: false # APQ must be turned off
```
**note**To enable safelisting, you must turn off [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/performance/caching/in-memory#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.

To execute an operation, clients can provide its PQL-specified ID or full operation string.
The router rejects unregistered operations, and if `log_unknown` is true, those operations appear in your [router's logs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview).

**tip**It's best to keep `log_unknown` as `true` while adopting safelisting so you can monitor the operations your router rejects. Once you're confident that all your clients are properly configured, you can turn it off to reduce noise in your logs.

You can opt out of safelist enforcement for individual requests via a [router customization](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#apollo_persisted_queriessafelistskip_enforcement) (Rhai script, coprocessor, etc).

#### Safelisting with IDs only

**caution**Do not start with this configuration. It requires all your clients to execute operations by providing their PQL-specified ID. If any clients still provide full operation strings, the router rejects those operations, even if they're included in the safelist.

With the following configuration, your router rejects all operation strings and only accepts registered operation IDs:

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  log_unknown: true
4  safelist:
5    enabled: true
6    require_id: true
7apq:
8  enabled: false # APQ must be turned off
```
**note**To enable safelisting, you must turn off [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/performance/caching/in-memory#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.

If you want to use this security level, you should always first set up [safelisting with operation strings allowed](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#safelisting). ID-only safelisting requires all your clients to execute operations via PQL-specified ID instead of an operation string. While making those necessary changes, you can use the less restrictive [safelisting mode](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#safelisting) in your router.

With `log_unknown` set to true, the router [logs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/router/telemetry/log-exporters/overview) all rejected operations, including those registered to your PQL but that used the full operation string rather than the PQL-specified ID.

**note**It's best to keep `log_unknown` as `true` while adopting safelisting so you can monitor the operations your router rejects. Once you're confident that all your clients are properly configured, you can turn it off to reduce noise in your logs.

You can opt out of safelist enforcement for individual requests via a [router customization](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#apollo_persisted_queriessafelistskip_enforcement) (Rhai script, coprocessor, etc).

### Configuration options

The router provides four configuration options that you can combine to create the recommended [security levels](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#router-security-levels). This section details each configuration option. Refer to the [security levels](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#router-security-levels) section for recommended combinations.

**note**From version `1.25.0` to `1.32.0`, the `persisted_queries` configuration option was named `preview_persisted_queries`. Upgrade your router to version `1.32.0` or later to use the [generally available](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/product-launch-stages/#general-availability) version of the feature and the example configuration snippets below.
#### `persisted_queries`

This base configuration enables the feature. All other configuration options build off this one.

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
```
#### `log_unknown`

Adding `log_unknown: true` to `persisted_queries` configures the router to log any incoming operations not registered to the PQL.

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  log_unknown: true
```

If used with the [`safelist`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#safelist) option, the router logs unregistered and rejected operations. With [`safelist.require_id`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#require_id) off, the only rejected operations are unregistered ones. If [`safelist.require_id`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#require_id) is turned on, operations can be rejected even when registered because they use operation IDs rather than operation strings.

#### `experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache`

This feature is [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/feature-launch-stages#experimental). Your questions and feedback are highly valuedâdon't hesitate to get in touch with your Apollo contact.

By default, the router [prewarms the query plan cache](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/in-memory-caching#cache-warm-up) using all operations on the PQL when a new schema is loaded, but not at startup. Using the `experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache` option, you can tell the router to prewarm the cache using the PQL on startup as well, or tell it not to prewarm the cache when reloading the schema. (This does not affect whether the router prewarms the query plan cache with recently-used operations from its in-memory cache.) Prewarming the cache means can reduce request latency by ensuring that operations are pre-planned when requests are received, but can make startup or schema reloads slower.

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  experimental_prewarm_query_plan_cache:
4    on_startup: true   # default: false
5    on_reload: false   # default: true
```
#### `experimental_local_manifests`

This feature is [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/reference/feature-launch-stages#experimental). Your questions and feedback are highly valuedâdon't hesitate to get in touch with your Apollo contact.

Adding `experimental_local_manifests` to your `persisted-queries` configuration lets you use local persisted query manifests instead of the hosted Uplink version. This is helpful when you're using an offline Enterprise license and can't use Uplink. With the `experimental_local_manifests`, the router doesn't reload the manifest from the file system, so you need to restart the router to apply changes.

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  experimental_local_manifests:
4    - ./path/to/persisted-query-manifest.json
```

You can download a version of your manifest to use locally from [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content)

. Open the PQL page for a graph by clicking the **Go to persisted query lists** to the left of the graph's name. Then, click the â¢â¢â¢ menu under the **Actions** column to download a PQL's manifest as a JSON file. Save this file locally and update your `experimental_local_manifests` configuration with the path the file.
#### `safelist`

Adding `safelist: true` to `persisted_queries` causes the router to reject any operations that haven't been registered to your PQL.

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  safelist:
4    enabled: true
5apq:
6  enabled: false
```
**note**To enable safelisting, you *must* turn off [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/operations/persisted-queries/#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.

By default, the [`require_id`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#require_id) suboption is `false`, meaning the router accepts both operation IDs and operation strings as long as the operation is registered.

#### `require_id`

Adding `require_id: true` to the `safelist` option causes the router to reject any operations that either:

* haven't been registered to your PQL
* use a full operation string rather than the operation ID

YAMLrouter.yaml copy
```
1persisted_queries:
2  enabled: true
3  safelist:
4    enabled: true
5    require_id: true
6apq:
7  enabled: false
```
**note**To enable safelisting, you *must* turn off [automatic persisted queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/in-memory-caching#caching-automatic-persisted-queries-apq) (APQs). APQs let clients [register arbitrary operations at runtime](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/operations/persisted-queries/#differences-from-automatic-persisted-queries) while safelisting restricts operations to those that have been explicitly registered.
### Customization via request context

GraphOS Router can be [customized](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/overview) via several mechanisms such as [Rhai scripts](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/rhai) and [coprocessors](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/coprocessor). These plugins can affect your router's persistent query processing by writing to the request context.

#### `apollo_persisted_queries::client_name`

When publishing operations to a PQL, you can specify a client name associated with the operation (by including a `clientName` field in the individual operation in your [manifest](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/security/persisted-queries#per-operation-properties), or by including the `--for-client-name` option to `rover persisted-queries publish`). If an operation has a client name, it will only be executed by requests that specify that client name. (Your PQL can contain multiple operations with the same ID and different client names.)

Your customization (Rhai script, coprocessor, etc) can examine a request during the [Router Service stage](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/overview#request-path) of the request path and set the `apollo_persisted_queries::client_name` value in the request context to the request's client name.

If this context value is not set by a customization, your router will use the same client name used for [client awareness](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/observability/client-awareness) in observability. This client name is read from an HTTP header specified by `telemetry.apollo.client_name_header`, or `apollographql-client-name` by default.

If your request specifies an ID and a client name but there is no operation in the PQL with that ID and client name, your router will look to see if there is an operation with that ID and no client name specified, and use that if it finds it.

#### `apollo_persisted_queries::safelist::skip_enforcement`

If safelisting is enabled, you can still opt out of safelist enforcement on a per-request basis.

Your customization (Rhai script, coprocessor, etc) can examine a request during the [Router Service stage](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/customization/overview#request-path) of the request path and set the `apollo_persisted_queries::safelist::skip_enforcement` value in the request context to the boolean value `true`.

For any request where you set this value, Router will skip safelist enforcement: requests with a full operation string will be allowed even if they are not in the safelist, and even if [`safelist.required_id`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#require_id) is enabled.

This does not affect the behavior of the [`log_unknown` option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/persisted-queries#log_unknown): unknown operations will still be logged if that option is set.

## Limitations

* **Unsupported with offline license**. An GraphOS Router using an [offline Enterprise license](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/enterprise-features/#offline-enterprise-license) cannot use safelisting with persisted queries. The feature relies on Apollo Uplink to fetch persisted query manifests, so it doesn't work as designed when the router is disconnected from Uplink.
