This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a specific REST API output. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information, including administrative credentials for an external authentication server.  **Note:** To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid ERS administrative credentials.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-pwd-WH64AhQF>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) Software if an external authentication server is configured.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Determine Whether External Authentication Server is Configured**  To determine whether an external authentication server is configured, follow these steps:    1. Log in to the Cisco ISE web management interface.   2. For Cisco ISE releases 3.0 and 3.1, click the menu icon. For earlier versions of Cisco ISE, skip this step.   3.
