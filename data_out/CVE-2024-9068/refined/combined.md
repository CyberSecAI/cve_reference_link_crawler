Please look in to the issues, because of this plugin we had to rollback to older elementor version, otherwise the website is totally broken.
Pls provide a update.

The project hasn’t been updated in almost three months, and support doesn’t respond to open questions. With such a variety of different plugins for Elementor, you are probably better off choosing one of the competitors.

Seems one of the best addons for elementor & highly functional, but still need some improvements, though the initial release seems so much promising.

### Description

The OneElements – Best Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
