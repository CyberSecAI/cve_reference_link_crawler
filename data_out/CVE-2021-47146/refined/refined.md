{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2021-47146",
    "description": "The `mld_newpack()` function in the Linux kernel's IPv6 multicast implementation does not allow the allocation of high-order pages, restricting it to order-0 allocations. If the headroom size is excessively large, a kernel panic can occur in the `skb_put()` function.",
    "affected_component": "Linux kernel's IPv6 multicast implementation (net/ipv6/mcast.c)",
    "root_cause": "The `mld_newpack()` function restricts allocations to order-0 pages. When the headroom is too large, `skb_put()` fails, leading to a kernel panic.",
    "vulnerability": "Kernel panic due to insufficient memory allocation in `skb_put()` when creating MLD packets.",
    "impact": "Kernel panic, causing denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "By creating a large number of IPv6 multicast groups, which causes `mld_newpack` to request large headroom.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a large number of IPv6 multicast groups.",
    "patch": "The patch removes the limitation of order-0 page allocations in mld_newpack()."
