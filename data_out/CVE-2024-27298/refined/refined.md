Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27298:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of regular expressions used in queries when Parse Server is configured to use a PostgreSQL database. Specifically, the `literalizeRegexPart` function did not properly escape single quotes and other characters, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By injecting specially crafted regular expressions, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `literalizeRegexPart` function, responsible for sanitizing regex input, failed to properly handle specific characters, especially single quotes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Integrity Compromise:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Availability Impact:** Although the CVSS score indicates no impact on availability, the injection could potentially lead to denial of service through resource exhaustion, although this is not directly mentioned.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Regex Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `$regex` parameter used in queries. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code within the regex string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `$regex` parameter within a query.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects Parse Server deployments using a PostgreSQL database.
- The fix involves improving the algorithm to detect and prevent SQL injection through regex parameters.
- The vulnerability is identified as "ZDI-CAN-19105: Parse Server literalizeRegexPart SQL Injection".
- The vulnerability was addressed in versions 6.5.0 and 7.0.0-alpha.20.
- The vulnerable function is `literalizeRegexPart` in `src/Adapters/Storage/Postgres/PostgresStorageAdapter.js`.
- The fix involved modifying `literalizeRegexPart` to properly sanitize special characters in regex strings.
