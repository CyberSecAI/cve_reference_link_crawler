  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2023-46229",
      "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `SitemapLoader` class of the langchain library. The loader, by default, did not specify a default URL filter leading to potential SSRF.",
       "root_cause": "The `SitemapLoader` in the langchain library did not have a default filter URL, which could allow it to load URLs outside of the intended domain.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to make requests to internal servers or other unintended targets, leading to information disclosure or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious sitemap URL to the SitemapLoader which has links pointing to internal/unintended servers.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the sitemap URL that is provided to the `SitemapLoader` and that sitemap needs to have links to internal/unintended servers."
    },
   {
     "cve": "CVE-2023-46229",
      "details": "The fix for the vulnerability introduces a default filter URL in the `SitemapLoader` and also introduces a security note to the recursive URL loader, highlighting the risks associated with web crawlers and how to mitigate them.",
       "root_cause": "The `RecursiveUrlLoader` class lacks sufficient warnings/documentation on usage which could lead to potential SSRF exploitation.",
        "weaknesses": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
       ],
       "impact": "Unwary users could use the `RecursiveUrlLoader` class in a way that may allow for SSRF attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": "The `RecursiveUrlLoader` class could be provided with a malicious URL which would then attempt to crawl child links, which could lead to unintended requests.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the initial URL that is provided to the `RecursiveUrlLoader` class."
