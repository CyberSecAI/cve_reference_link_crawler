|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*Security Note\*\*: This loader is a crawler that will start crawling |
|  |  | at a given URL and then expand to crawl child links recursively. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Web crawlers should generally NOT be deployed with network access |
|  |  | to any internal servers. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Control access to who can submit crawling requests and what network access |
|  |  | the crawler has. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | While crawling, the crawler may encounter malicious URLs that would lead to a |
|  |  | server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To mitigate risks, the crawler by default will only load URLs from the same |
|  |  | domain as the start URL (controlled via prevent\_outside named argument). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This will mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks, but will not eliminate it. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For example, if crawling a host which hosts several sites: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | https://some\_host/alice\_site/ |
|  |  | https://some\_host/bob\_site/ |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A malicious URL on Alice's site could cause the crawler to make a malicious |
|  |  | GET request to an endpoint on Bob's site. Both sites are hosted on the |
|  |  | same host, so such a request would not be prevented by default. |
