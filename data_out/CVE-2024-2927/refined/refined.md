Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `Details.php` file of the MobileShop-master application, specifically through the `id` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database.
- **Potential Exploitation of Other Vulnerabilities:** Using the compromised database to further compromise the system.
- **Full Database Disclosure:** As demonstrated via sqlmap, an attacker can dump the database.
- **Complete application compromise:** With database access, further attacks can occur.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/MobileShop-master/Details.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic knowledge of SQL injection:** The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests:** Tools such as Burp Suite can be used.
