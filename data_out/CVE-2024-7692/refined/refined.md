- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed by a user, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. This vulnerability can be exploited against high privilege users such as admins.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious link containing the malicious payload is crafted and needs to be opened by a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious script, and trick a user into clicking the link. The user must be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.
