Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `SystemSettings.php` file of the Yoga Class Registration System. Specifically, the `address` parameter within the `update_settings` function is not sanitized, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through the `address` field are stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the contact information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can use the injected script to steal the cookies of the administrator. This allows the attacker to impersonate the administrator and gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Account Takeover:** By obtaining administrator cookies, attackers can gain full control of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Further attacks:** XSS can be leveraged to execute other client-side attacks, including redirecting users to malicious websites, phishing or data exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request with malicious payload to the server.
- **Web Interface:** The malicious payload is submitted through the system's admin interface, specifically the contact information settings.
- **File:** The vulnerability exists in `/php-ycrs/classes/SystemSettings.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Registration System:** The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the system through the front-end interface. This could be any user who can access and submit data through the registration interface.
- **Basic knowledge of HTTP and HTML/JavaScript**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious payload.
- **No Privilege escalation is required:** Any user can insert the XSS payload via the registration system.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable parameter is `address`.
- The vulnerable script is `/php-ycrs/classes/SystemSettings.php` with function `update_settings`.
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS.
- The payload provided includes an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler to execute JavaScript and steal cookies.
- The attacker could inject a variety of Javascript payloads to exfiltrate data or redirect the victim.
