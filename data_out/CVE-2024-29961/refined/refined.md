- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Brocade SANnav service sends ping commands in the background at regular intervals to `gridgain.com` and `ignite.apache.org` to check for updates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Unnecessary network communication to external resources. This exposes the system to potential supply chain attacks. The system also sends the pings without any authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker could become aware of the behavior and potentially launch a supply-chain attack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker could monitor network traffic and identify the pings to the specified domains.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to observe the network traffic generated by the Brocade SANnav appliance. They do not need any authentication to the device.
