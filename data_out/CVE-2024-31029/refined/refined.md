The provided content relates to CVE-2024-31029.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by memory misalignment due to improper handling of misaligned memory addresses in the `coap_msg.c` file within the FreeCoAP library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory misalignment in `coap_msg.c`
- Improper handling of misaligned memory addresses.
- Null pointer dereference in `test_coap_server.c` within `server_handle_regular` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (crash) due to memory misalignment leading to a crash.
- Potential information disclosure from memory access violations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted CoAP packet to the server.
- The crafted packet triggers misaligned memory access during the packet processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker capable of sending CoAP packets to a vulnerable server.
- Must be able to craft CoAP packets specifically to trigger the misaligned memory access.
