- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the authentication mechanism of confd, including:
  - Concurrent execution using a shared resource with improper synchronization.
  - Authentication bypass through capture-replay.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **CWE-362**: Improper synchronization leading to concurrent execution issues.
  - **CWE-294**: Authentication bypass via capture-replay attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can circumvent the authentication process and authenticate as a legitimate cluster peer. This can lead to unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service.
