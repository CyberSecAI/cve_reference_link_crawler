    - Where can I find the env file, it will be be available after theme installation on web server?

      also, is there a way to unlock OTP and Affiliate Add On? I would like to create another page and display it in home page, with custom listing, will I be able to achieve it?

      Thanks for making this available for free, I can explore and if I am convinced I can go for paid version.

# CVE-2023-39115

Description:
Campcodes Online Matrimonial Website System Script v3.3 is vulnerable to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted server. The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of uploaded files, particularly SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious code.

Attack Vector:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting an SVG file that includes malicious script code, which is executed when the SVG file is processed by the application's upload functionality.

Impact:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could allow the attacker to take control of the application and potentially the entire server, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and further attacks on the underlying infrastructure.

Affected Versions:
Campcodes Online Matrimonial Website System Script v3.3 is confirmed to be affected by this vulnerability. Other versions might also be vulnerable, but this version has been specifically identified.

Mitigation:
To mitigate this vulnerability, the vendor should implement thorough input validation and file type verification checks for uploaded files. Additionally, users are advised to update to a patched version of the software as soon as it becomes available.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
