Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-2636:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2018-2636, describing a directory traversal vulnerability in Oracle Hospitality Simphony (MICROS) versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9. This aligns with the information that this CVE relates to an Oracle product.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw within the Oracle Hospitality Simphony software, specifically related to how it processes file paths.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **Directory Traversal:** The software improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing attackers to navigate outside the intended directory structure of the server's file system using specially crafted requests that include directory traversal characters such as `..`.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, and log files.
  - **Potential for Further Attacks:** Access to sensitive information can be leveraged for subsequent attacks, like compromising the entire system or gaining access to other resources on the network.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specifically crafted HTTP POST requests sent to the `/EGateway/EGateway.asmx` endpoint, leveraging the SOAP protocol.
  - **Modified DIME requests:** Attackers need to modify specific parts of the SOAP message to perform directory traversal.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the Oracle Hospitality Simphony application, typically on port 8080 or a similar port.
   - **Knowledge of SOAP Protocol:** A basic understanding of SOAP requests, DIME, and how to craft them is required to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit code provided uses Python to craft the malicious requests.
*   The exploit code shows how to get server info, DB credentials and list and read arbitrary log files
*   The vulnerability resides in how the server handles DIME requests.
*   The exploit uses techniques such as byte encoding to craft the malicious path in the request.
*   The `calculate_len` function dynamically calculates sizes for headers
*   The exploit code uses various helper functions (`rm_right`, `add_right`, `rm_left`, `add_left`) to craft byte sequences correctly.

**Summary:**
The provided content demonstrates a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2018-2636) in Oracle Hospitality Simphony versions 2.7 to 2.9. An attacker with network access can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests that allow reading arbitrary files. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure and further system compromise. The provided exploit code offers a practical way to test and verify the vulnerability.
