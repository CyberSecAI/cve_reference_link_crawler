- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Backpack plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, allowing stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output escaping in plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will then execute in the browsers of other users accessing the affected pages, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on their behalf, steal cookies, or redirect them to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the text input fields and textareas in the plugin settings page, an attacker can insert malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the plugin's settings page. The attack can be performed even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed, such as in a multisite setup.
