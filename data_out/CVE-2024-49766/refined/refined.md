{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `os.path.isabs()` function in Python versions prior to 3.11 on Windows does not correctly identify UNC paths (e.g., `//server/share`) as absolute paths. Werkzeug's `safe_join()` function relies on `os.path.isabs()` to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially construct unsafe paths, leading to unintended access to files or directories. This could allow access to sensitive information, depending on the application using the library.",
     "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network and a crafted path.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. However, the attacker must be able to provide input to the vulnerable application that uses the `safe_join` function.",
     "additional_information": "The fix involves adding additional checks in `safe_join()` to handle these cases on Windows when using older python versions, specifically checking if the path starts with '/'. The vulnerability is only present on Windows when using Python versions before 3.11. Applications using Python >= 3.11 or running on other OS are not vulnerable"
