# Advisory Details

May 1st, 2023
## (Pwn2Own) NETGEAR RAX30 soap\_serverd Stack-based Buffer Overflow Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

### ZDI-23-499ZDI-CAN-19839

| CVE ID | [CVE-2023-27368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27368) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 8.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [NETGEAR](https://www.netgear.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [RAX30](https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/routers/rax30/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR RAX30 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the soap\_serverd binary. When parsing SOAP message headers, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | NETGEAR has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
