| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1778586#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-12-02 05:28:11 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  The (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones.  Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP.  In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users.  This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS.  If a DNS record was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1778586#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-12-02 05:28:16 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Samba project Upstream: Andreas Oster   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1778586#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-12-02 15:28:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux because there is no support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1778586#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-12-10 09:02:27 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-14861.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1778586#c5)  Huzaifa S.
