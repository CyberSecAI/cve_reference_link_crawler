On 31/01/24 07:39, Qualys Security Advisory wrote:
&gt; We discovered a memory corruption in the glibc's qsort() function, due
&gt; to a missing bounds check. To be vulnerable, a program must call qsort()
&gt; with a nontransitive comparison function (a function cmp(int a, int b)
&gt; that returns (a - b), for example) and with a large number of attacker-
&gt; controlled elements (to cause a malloc() failure inside qsort()). We
&gt; have not tried to find such a vulnerable program in the real world.
&gt;
&gt; All glibc versions from at least September 1992 (glibc 1.04) to the
&gt; current release (glibc 2.38) are affected, but the glibc's developers
&gt; have independently discovered and patched this memory corruption in the
&gt; master branch (commit b9390ba, "stdlib: Fix array bounds protection in
&gt; insertion sort phase of qsort") during a recent refactoring of qsort().

In or before 2006 [1], the Samba project forked and modified a copy of
glibc _quicksort() to create the qsort_r-like ldb_qsort(). In those
days qsort_r() was rare (glibc got it in 2008), and Samba wanted
comparison semantics to follow changes in the LDAP schema, for which
the qsort_r context blob was thought useful.

[1] <a href="https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/de296b65136c3d7b6170db099b626d94fa190306" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/de296b65136c3d7b6170db099b626d94fa190306</a>

The code we copied was not the try-mergesort-first qsort() glibc uses
(and used then) -- it was the quicksort-of-last-resort that Qualys
reports on. I guess we were aiming for simplicity. At times we have
discussed switching to qsort_r(), but that always founders because
each libc does it slightly differently (and qsort_s does not solve
every problem).

So Samba was very susceptible to this bug. The good news is
ldb_qsort() is not used in very many places, and some of those places
already used transitive comparison functions. The other good news is
that *now* it is patched with the "tmp_ptr &gt; base_ptr &amp;&amp;" fix. And the
third good news is that the comparison functions are fixed. That's in
4.19.7 and 4.20.2.

We also had quite a large number of non-transitive comparisons using
the system qsort(). These are vulnerable with glibc under memory
pressure, as described by Qualys, who also note:

&gt; Remotely, forcing this malloc() failure is harder: either allocate a
&gt; large amount of memory (e.g., a memory leak) in the network service that
&gt; is being targeted, or in another network service on the same machine.

Samba servers are quite complex, and it would be easy for the attacker
to miss the right allocation and induce a different failure. There are
almost certainly other more appealing and less noticeable attacks.
Nevertheless we have been auditing and fixing all our compare
functions. The lack of a clear attack helped us choose do that without
an embargo shroud and the associated fuss. In any case, I fear there
is greater danger for a project like Samba from a bad sort that
*doesn't* crash the server (more on this later).

The thing I found interesting, and which led me to write, is that we
knew all the pieces of this, but never put them together.

For a start, we were well aware that glibc qsort() uses mergesort by
default, because (as the glibc people discovered when they tried to
change it) we had inadvertently come to rely on it. This caused bugs
on other platforms [2] and even led us to write our own stable sort
for when we really need it.

[2] <a href="https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba-technical/2018-March/126023.html" rel="nofollow">https://lists.samba.org/archive/samba-technical/2018-March/126023.html</a>

We have also been fixing bugs in ldb_qsort() comparison functions
without fully realising that we were dealing with a class of problem.
For example, in the bug we called CVE-2019-14861 [3], we have comments
like "This looks like a bug in ldb_qsort()" and "when I patch
ldb_qsort() for qsort_r() the problem goes away". But when we find the
problem in the compare function we say "I'm assuming that the issue is
due to the unstable sort in dns_name_compare()", and sort of forget
that ldb_qsort() is *also* the problem.

[3] <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14138" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14138</a>, fixed in
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/defb23732515e3c638d0081f5e4043fbb35d303c" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/defb23732515e3c638d0081f5e4043fbb35d303c</a>

The problem we fixed in dns_name_compare() was this:

        /* '@' record and the search_name record gets preference */
        if (name1[0] == '@') {
                return -1;
        }
        if (search_name &amp;&amp; strcasecmp(name1, search_name) == 0) {
                return -1;
        }

which tries to unconditionally squish names starting with "@" and
whatever search_name is to the start of the array (which is the
problem end for these buggy quicksorts). When the array has both
search_name and an @-name, or multiple @-names, the comparison was
non-transitive.

Git says I reviewed the CVE-2019-14861 patches, though I don't
remember anything (I mean, CVSS 5.3, authenticated client can crash
the server, who cares). But mistrust of ldb_qsort() lingered, and I
saw what the Qualys report meant for it.

The CVE-2019-14861 patch fixed the explicit attempt to push multiple
values into one spot, but it left this in the same function:

        if (name1 == NULL || name2 == NULL) {
                return 0;
        }

which is non-transitive, given we otherwise compare name1 and name2.
For example, consider names {"a", NULL, "b"}. Then we have

   "a" &lt; "b"
   "a" == NULL
   "b" == NULL

meaning the order in which we compare things will affect how they end
up. Perhaps this was never enough to go out of bounds, and perhaps
there was never going to be a NULL in this list. In any case, now we
go:

       if (name1 == name2) {
               /* this includes the both NULL case */
               return 0;
       }
       if (name1 == NULL) {
               return -1;
       }
       if (name2 == NULL) {
               return 1;
       }

which is transitive, sorting NULLs to the beginning of the list for
easy discovery (we check in the next loop).

I found a 2006 bug report [4] with the name "SEGV crash due to random
libads/dns.c qsort() comparison function".

[4] <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3959" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3959</a> fixed in
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/18feaab9d556c4bd41a19823b3982e2bc30a2055" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/18feaab9d556c4bd41a19823b3982e2bc30a2055</a>

To quote from the bug:

   The qsort() used in libads/dns.c is regularly trashing the list of
   Domain Controllers. This is because the comparison function
   dnssrvcmp() is using rand(). AFAIK, that's not recommended --
   repeated calls to the qsort() comparison function with the same
   args _must_ return the same, consistent results. [....]

   Hence this:

	int bad_compare(const void *l, const void *r) {
		return (rand() % 3) - 1;
	}

   is a terrible function to use, and causes real qsort()s to run off
   into the weeds.

We weren't doing that, exactly, FWIW. It is good to be reminded that
in 2006 it was normal for a qsort to "run off into the weeds". The
problem for projects like Samba is it is easy for us to pick up little
pieces of 2006 and carry them along with as we go.

We also have several commits like this one from 2009 [5]:

    librpc: fixed the GUID_compare() function

    When comparing two unsigned values you can't just subtract
    them.

    Imagine you are comparing: "uint32_t u1" and "uint32_t u2". If you use
    "u1 - u2" and u2 is zero, then the signed integer result will depend
    on the top bit of u1.

    This error occurs in a few places in Samba. For DRS replication it
    resulted in corrupt uptodateness vectors.

[5] <a href="https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/a106fefcfb0cb60ce439884d8cd0c920d2fb193a" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/samba-team/samba/-/commit/a106fefcfb0cb60ce439884d8cd0c920d2fb193a</a>

What I am getting at is we have been all over this class of bug, but
in a shamefully ad-hoc and folkloric way -- "you can't use rand()",
"you can't subtract unsigned values", "you can't push two things into
the same place", "you can't subtract" -- all of which are incomplete
(and/or overreaching; you can safely subtract char, for example).
Somehow we never got to the obvious position that all comparisons have
to be transitive. Thanks to Qualys for the clarity.

Thanks I guess also to C for being so unsafe and report-worthy. What
worries me more about a bad sort in Samba AD is the ability to hide
things without crashing. Attackers are likely to prefer a persistent
unseen presence over bringing down a server process. Being in the
wrong place in a sorted list might not seem like great hiding, but we
do more complicated things with the sorted arrays, including binary
search. The comparison in the binary search will visit a subset of
values in a different order that the sort, so will likely step over or
be thrown awry by the missorted element. That means the bad comparison
could make something appear to vanish in some circumstances and not
others. (I didn't look for actual instances of this, I just fixed the
comparison functions).

As I mentioned, ldb_qsort() and most comparison functions are fixed in
4.19.7 and 4.20.2 (both released earlier this month). One particularly
complicated comparison function required an API change in the public
libldb, so it will appear in 4.21 (probably September). That one isn't
used with ldb_qsort(), so it is likely safe or safe-ish, depending on
your libc.
