Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application's reliance on user-controlled data from a cookie (`username cookie`) to populate the `$_SESSION['username']` variable. This variable is later used in `profile.php` without proper sanitization, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the `$_SESSION['username']` is directly echoed in the HTML output via `echo $_SESSION['username'] . ' - Профиль';`.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS because it directly uses user-supplied data (from the `username cookie`) within an HTML page without sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
    * **Insecure Data Handling:** The application blindly trusts and uses the cookie data without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable `profile.php` page. This can lead to various attacks like:
        *   Stealing cookies or session information
        *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
        *   Modifying the content of the page
        *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
* **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker can set a malicious value for the `username cookie` in the victim's browser via a separate method (e.g., through a malicious link, or if the user previously visited a compromised website) or through manipulating a vulnerable part of the application that may be able to set the cookie.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to set/control the `username cookie` value for the victim's browser. This can be achieved via a number of attack vectors.
    *   The victim must then visit the vulnerable `profile.php` page to trigger the XSS.
