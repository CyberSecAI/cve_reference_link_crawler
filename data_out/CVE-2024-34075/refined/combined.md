# kurwov vulnerable to Denial of Service due to improper data sanitization

Moderate

[xiboon](/xiboon)
published
GHSA-hfrv-h3q8-9jpr
May 3, 2024

## Package

npm

kurwov
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

> 3.1.0, < 3.2.5

## Patched versions

3.2.5

## Description

### Summary

An unsafe sanitization of dataset contents on the `MarkovData#getNext` method used in `Markov#generate` and `Markov#choose` allows a maliciously crafted string on the dataset to throw and stop the function from running properly.

### Details

[kurwov/src/MarkovData.ts](https://github.com/xiboon/kurwov/blob/0d58dfa42135ab40e830e92622857282f980ca89/src/MarkovData.ts#L38-L44)

Lines 38 to 44
in
[0d58dfa](/xiboon/kurwov/commit/0d58dfa42135ab40e830e92622857282f980ca89)

|  | getNext(current: string) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | if (!current) return; |
|  | const data = this.finalData[current.slice(0, -1)]; |
|  | if (!data) return; |
|  | const random = Math.floor(Math.random() \* data.length); |
|  | return data[random].endsWith(' ') ? data[random] : `${data[random]} `; |
|  | } |

If a string contains a forbidden substring (i.e. `__proto__`) followed by a space character, the second line will access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData` by removing the last character of the string, bypassing the dataset sanitization (as it is supposed to be already sanitized before this function is called).

`data` is then defined as the special function found in its prototype instead of an array.

On the last line, `data` is then indexed by a random number, which is supposed to return a string but returns undefined as it's a function. Calling `endsWith` then throws.

### PoC

<https://runkit.com/embed/m6uu40r5ja9b>

### Impact

Any dataset can be contaminated with the substring making it unable to properly generate anything in some cases.

### Severity

Moderate

6.2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
