Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The Avada theme's Fusion-Builder plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization and lack of proper preparation of the `entry` parameter in the `fusion_remove_form_entry` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `entry` parameter, intended to be an integer representing a form entry ID, is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `entry` parameter.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query is not prepared using parameterized queries, which would prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with editor privileges can potentially gain further access by exploiting the SQL injection flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **`fusion_remove_form_entry` Action:** The vulnerable code is within the handling of the `fusion_remove_form_entry` action.
*   **`entry` Parameter:** The injected SQL code is passed through the `entry` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least editor-level access (or any user with `delete_others_posts` capability).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable SQL query is located within the form entry deletion functionality of the Fusion-Builder plugin.
*   The attacker injects SQL code into the `entry` parameter. For example: `(select*from(select(sleep(10)))asdf)`
*   The injected code is appended to the existing SQL query without proper sanitization or preparation.
*   The provided proof-of-concept exploit script demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a time-based SQL injection.
*   The fix is to cast the parameter to an integer before using it in the database query.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Avada theme versions <= 7.11.6 and Fusion-Builder <= 3.11.4 are vulnerable.

**Patch Information:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Avada 7.11.7 and later.
