- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `formSetDebugCfg` function in IP-COM M50 routers does not properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `pEnable`, `pLevel`, and `pModule` parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on the router.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted GET request to the `/action/setDebugCfg` endpoint, with malicious input in the `pEnable`, `pLevel`, or `pModule` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the router. The provided example indicates no prior authentication is needed.
