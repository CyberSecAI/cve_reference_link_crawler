There is a SQL injection vulnerability in Byzro Networks Smart S20 management platform

#### 1.Vulnerability description

Beijing Baizhuo Network Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Baizhuo Network) is a high-tech enterprise dedicated to building the next generation of secure Internet.
There is a SQL injection vulnerability in Byzro Networks Smart S20 gateway intelligent management platform. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to gain server permissions and manipulate server files to obtain sensitive information.

#### 2.Impact of vulnerabilities

Smart S20

#### 3.Vulnerability location

/sysmanage/sysmanageajax.php

#### 4.Recurrence of vulnerabilities

To protect privacy, the public IP addresses in the following examples have been coded and can be tested based on search engines such as shadon and fofa.

##### Case 1

(1)After entering the login page, the account password is admin/admin.

[![](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/raw/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128012332771.png)](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/blob/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128012332771.png)

(2)Construct the following POC and execute the blind injection successfully. Note: The cookie field needs to be replaced with the value after login, and test2 cannot be repeated during the test.

```
POST /sysmanage/sysmanageajax.php HTTP/1.1

There is a delay in page response echo, which proves the existence of SQL injection vulnerability.

##### Case 2

(1)Enter the login page, the account password is admin/sssw-0476.

[![](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/raw/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128012351673.png)](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/blob/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128012351673.png)

```

There is a delayed response, and the 5s is consistent with the injection statement, so there is a SQL injection vulnerability.

#### 5.Code analysis

In sysmanageajax.php, first of all, the $post\_src and $post\_type parameters are controllable and are passed in through the post method.

[![](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/raw/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128005938583.png)](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/blob/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128005938583.png)

Therefore, you can control the input of src=manageadmin and type=add, so that the program logic jumps to the content as shown below.

[![](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/raw/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128010425584.png)](https://github.com/rockersiyuan/CVE/blob/main/smart%20s20.assets/image-20240128010425584.png)

The $rolseid parameter here is directly spliced into the SQL query statement without any security filtering, so there is a SQL injection point. The attacker only needs to control the id parameter passed in through the post method to cause SQL injection.
