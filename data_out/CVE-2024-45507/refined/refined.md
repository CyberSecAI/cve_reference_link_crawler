Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-45507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of screen/script URIs when loading files from Java or Groovy. This allows for the use of URLs in file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The ability to include URLs in file paths can be exploited to make the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs.
- **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious code by using URLs that point to external resources which can be loaded and executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SSRF and code injection vulnerabilities, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
-  The ability to load files from arbitrary URLs can be used to read and exfiltrate sensitive information or manipulate the server's internal state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a malicious URL within a screen/script URI which is then processed by the OFBiz application.
- This could be done through various input fields, parameters, or configurations that allow the specification of file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted URL as input to the vulnerable application.
- No mention of specific authentication requirements are mentioned in the provided text, implying that the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication depending on the context in which the vulnerable code is used.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache OFBiz versions prior to 18.12.16 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache OFBiz version 18.12.16 or later, where the issue is resolved through added validation of screen/script URIs, effectively blocking the use of URL patterns.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was discovered by Sun Xiang.
- The fix is implemented in commit `ffb1bc4879`.
