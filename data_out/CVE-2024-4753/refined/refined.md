- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed through the plugin's settings page. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject the malicious payload into the "Label For Submit Button" setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user (e.g., admin) to access and modify the plugin's settings.
