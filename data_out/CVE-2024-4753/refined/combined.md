## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Secure Maintenance < 1.7 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to WP Secure Settings.
2. Add the payload`"><IMG SRC=x onerror="alert(document.cookie)"></img>` as the "Label For Submit Button"
4. Click on "Save Changes" and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
