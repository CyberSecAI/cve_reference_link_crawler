SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting due to insufficient encoding of user-controlled input. An unauthenticated attacker could craft a malicious URL and trick a user to click it. If the victim clicks on this crafted URL before it times out, then the attacker could read and manipulate user content in the browser.
