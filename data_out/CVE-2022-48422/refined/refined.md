Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The ONLYOFFICE desktop editor searches for and attempts to load libraries from various locations, including the current working directory, before checking standard system library paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Library Loading:** The application prioritizes loading libraries from the current working directory (CWD) over system directories. This is a classic example of a "current directory DLL hijacking" or "relative path library loading" vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the source or integrity of the loaded libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a malicious shared library (e.g., a modified `libgcc_s.so.1`) in the same directory as a document opened by the vulnerable application. When the application tries to load the library, it will load the attacker's malicious library instead of the legitimate system library, resulting in arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running ONLYOFFICE.
- **User Privilege Escalation:** The malicious code is executed with the same privileges as the user running ONLYOFFICE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Manipulation:** An attacker must be able to write a malicious library to a location where a victim might open a document using ONLYOFFICE. This could be a shared folder, a user's home directory, or a USB drive.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the victim to open a document from a directory where the malicious library is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to a directory where a victim user will open a document using ONLYOFFICE.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a victim into opening a document from a directory containing the malicious library.
- **Shared Library Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a shared library (e.g., `libgcc_s.so.1`).

**Additional Notes**
- The forum post mentions libgcc\_s.so.1 and libselinux.so.1 as examples, but it's likely that other libraries could also be targeted.
- The initial report was for an older version of ONLYOFFICE, and a fix was implemented, which is why the user "alef" confirmed that the exploit does not work on version 7.3.3
- The forum thread shows that the vendor was responsive to the report and worked to fix the issue.
- The user "alef" was initially asking for a CVE ID since he felt it had been long enough for the bug to be resolved.
