The provided content describes a command injection vulnerability in the TOTOLink A7000R V9.1.0u.6115_B20201022 router.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a format string vulnerability in the `sprintf` function. The value of the `Lang` parameter, which is controlled by the user, is formatted into a string using `sprintf` without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `sprintf` function is used to format a user-provided string (`Lang`) into another string (`V7`) without limiting the size of the format string, leading to a potential buffer overflow on the stack.
- **Command Injection:** Although not directly stated, the vulnerability leads to command injection since it can overwrite PC registers, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the stack overflow, an attacker can hijack PC registers, enabling arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Root Shell:** The attacker can obtain a stable root shell without authorization, gaining complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with a crafted JSON payload.
- **`lang` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `lang` parameter within the JSON payload, which is used to pass a long string that triggers the stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface (e.g., by being on the same network).
- **HTTP Request knowledge:** The attacker must have the knowledge to forge a specific HTTP POST request including the vulnerable `lang` parameter

**Technical Details:**
- The `lang` parameter in the POST request is used as input.
- The `sprintf` function formats this input into `V7`, but the input size is not checked.
- By providing a large string for the `lang` parameter, the attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack.
- This allows the attacker to redirect the execution flow and execute arbitrary code.
- The exploit can be verified by checking the `defaultLang` value by sending a `getInitCfg` request after exploiting the vulnerability.
