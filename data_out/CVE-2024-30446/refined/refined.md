- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CRM Perks Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts into the website, leading to execution of those scripts when users visit the site. This could result in various malicious actions, such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user input within the plugin which is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable input fields. The required privilege is specified as "Contributor", implying that a user with Contributor role or higher could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
