Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `JPEG2000Codec::DecodeByStreamsCommon` function of the Grassroots DiCoM (GDCM) library.
- The root cause is a missing size check for a buffer memory. Specifically, the allocated buffer size based on image dimensions read from the DICOM file is not validated against the actual size needed for decoding, which is later determined by the `opj_read_header` function. This discrepancy leads to an out-of-bounds write during the pixel data copying process.
- The allocated buffer size (`len`) is calculated using the dimensions from the DICOM header, which are used for allocation. The pixel data processing logic later relies on image information obtained from the OpenJPEG library (via `opj_read_header`). The vulnerability arises when these two sizes do not match.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when the code writes pixel data beyond the allocated buffer. This is caused by writing to memory using the `data8` pointer, which increments by `image->numcomps` in each iteration, potentially exceeding the allocated `raw` buffer if the dimensions used to allocate the buffer differ from those returned by `opj_read_header`.
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The out-of-bounds write specifically results in a heap-based buffer overflow.  Since the buffer `raw` is allocated on the heap, writing beyond its bounds corrupts heap memory.
- **Missing Size Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation or correlation between the allocated buffer size and the size of data being copied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:**  Successful exploitation leads to heap-based buffer overflow and memory corruption.
- **Potential Code Execution:** The memory corruption could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the heap to place executable code or modify function pointers.
- **Denial of Service:**  At a minimum, the heap corruption will likely cause a crash and denial of service, due to the ASan heap-buffer-overflow detection and abort.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious DICOM File:** An attacker crafts a malicious DICOM file that triggers the vulnerability during the decoding process.
- **File Processing:**  The attack vector involves processing the malicious DICOM file by a vulnerable GDCM application, such as an application that uses GDCM to convert or display medical images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to supply a malicious DICOM file:**  The attacker needs the capability to supply a crafted DICOM file, either through a file upload mechanism or by making a vulnerable application process the malicious DICOM.
- **No special access needed:** The vulnerability is triggered during normal processing of image data, so no specific user privileges are needed to trigger it.
- **No user interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any user interaction other than having the victim process a malicious DICOM file.
