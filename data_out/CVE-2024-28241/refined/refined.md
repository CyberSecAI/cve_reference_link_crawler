Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28241:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the MSI installer for GLPI-Agent not correctly setting the security permissions on the installation directory when a non-default installation path is chosen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect directory permissions: When the GLPI Agent is installed in a non-default directory, the installer fails to apply the necessary security permissions, making the installation folder modifiable by non-administrator users.
- Lack of inheritance: The installer doesn't ensure that the correct security profile for the installation directory is set, particularly related to inheritance of permissions, allowing unauthorized modifications to the directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local user with low privileges can modify the GLPI-Agent code or its DLLs by writing to the insecure installation folder.
- Code Execution: By modifying the agentâ€™s files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the GLPI-Agent service, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- Data integrity and confidentiality compromise: By modifying the agent logic, an attacker can impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the monitored system and the GLPI server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.
- Non-Default Install Path: The vulnerability is triggered only when the GLPI agent is installed to a non-default directory path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-Privilege Local User: The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges on the system where GLPI-Agent is installed.
- Ability to write to the installation directory: If the GLPI agent is not installed in the default path, the low privileged user can write to the installation directory.
- User Interaction: User interaction is required to install the software in a non-default path

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in GLPI-Agent version 1.7.2, where the installer was updated to apply the correct permissions also for non default installation path.
- The fix also explicitly sets folder permission using icacls.exe to remove inheritance rights in the installation directory and sets specific permissions for CREATOR OWNER, LocalSystem and Administrators and AuthenticatedUser
- Workarounds include using the default install folder or manually securing the folder permissions.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3, with high ratings for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
