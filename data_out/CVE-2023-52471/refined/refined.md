The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `devm_kasprintf()` function, used to allocate memory for device names, can return a NULL pointer if memory allocation fails. The code did not check for this NULL return, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability. The code accesses the `name` pointer without checking if `devm_kasprintf()` successfully allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A null pointer dereference can lead to a crash of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Memory allocation failure, which can be influenced by resource exhaustion, causing `devm_kasprintf` to return NULL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to trigger a scenario where `devm_kasprintf` fails to allocate memory. This is typically not a direct attacker influence, but it can be achieved indirectly through resource exhaustion. The attacker would need to have a degree of access to the system, such as running a process or having some influence over system resources.

**Additional details:**
The fix adds a check to verify the return of `devm_kasprintf()` and exits early if it's NULL. The issue occurs in two different places within the same file: `ice_ptp_register_auxbus_driver` and `ice_ptp_create_auxbus_device`.
