    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts which will be executed when an admin views the reports section. This allows attackers to perform actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the admin. The provided exploit shows that a reverse connection can be established.",

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to submit data through the vulnerable form. No authentication is required for initial injection of the payload. The admin needs to login to trigger the XSS"
