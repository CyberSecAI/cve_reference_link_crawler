# Impersonation and takeover of remote accounts with unnormalized signed activities

High

[syuilo](/syuilo)
published
GHSA-2vxv-pv3m-3wvj
Jun 2, 2024

## Package

Misskey

## Affected versions

<= 2024.3.1

## Patched versions

2024.5.0

## Description

### Summary

Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities.

### Details

*The reporter intends to keep this section undisclosed at least for 30 days after the publication of the advisory and until the remedy has been deployed widely.*

### PoC

*The reporter intends to keep this section undisclosed at least for 30 days after the publication of the advisory and until the remedy has been deployed widely.*

### Impact

The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate a target remote account and perform spoofed activities of any type attributed to the target account, provided that the threat actor has access to a valid Linked Data Signature by the target account.

There are a number of situations where the threat actor can obtain a valid signature by the target account, including:

* The target account sends a signed activity to another account and the recipient account's server forwards the activity to a server controlled by the threat actor according to the [inbox forwarding](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-activitypub-20180123/#inbox-forwarding) mechanism of ActivityPub
* The target account has joined a *relay* to which a server controlled by the threat actor subscribes, and sends a signed activity to that relay

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
