The provided content relates to CVE-2024-32983.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Misskey's failure to properly normalize the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them. This lack of normalization allows attackers to manipulate the content of signed activities while preserving the original signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper normalization of JSON structures in ActivityPub objects.
- Lack of sufficient verification of the content of signed activities after processing.
- The system relies on the signature to verify the authenticity of the activity without verifying the content's integrity after processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Impersonation of remote accounts.
- Spoofing of activities: Attackers can perform any type of activity while impersonating the target account, including creating, deleting, liking, or announcing content.
- Account takeover: By impersonating a user, an attacker can potentially gain control over the account or perform actions with the account's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the network, as it involves the processing of ActivityPub objects received over the network.
- An attacker needs to obtain a valid Linked Data Signature from the target account, which can be achieved through:
  - Inbox forwarding: When a target account sends a signed activity to another account and the recipient forwards the activity to a server controlled by the attacker.
  - Relay subscriptions: When the target account sends a signed activity to a relay that the attacker's server subscribes to.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to a valid Linked Data Signature from the target account.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target server.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker needs to control a server capable of receiving ActivityPub activities.
- The attacker should be able to craft malicious ActivityPub objects.
