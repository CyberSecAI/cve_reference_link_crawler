### FinalitÃ  e modalitÃ  operative

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/meno.svg)

Nellâambito delle attivitÃ  di Cybersecurity di TIM, Ã¨ stato costituito un gruppo di lavoro dedicato allâesecuzione di Security Assessment (Red Team), che si occupa di analizzare software sviluppato on-demand, software di mercato e firmware.

Tra gli obiettivi del team câÃ¨ quello di rilevare le vulnerabilitÃ  che un potenziale attaccante potrebbe sfruttare per eseguire degli attacchi informatici verso le infrastrutture di TIM ed evidenziarne gli impatti reali rilevati.

LâattivitÃ  non si limita alla sola verifica delle vulnerabilitÃ  note, ma include unâattivitÃ  di ricerca specifica con lâobiettivo di scoprire eventuali nuove vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora conosciute pubblicamente (vulnerabilitÃ  0day).

Qualora vengano rilevate vulnerabilitÃ  0day, si procede con una âdivulgazione responsabileâ verso il produttore del prodotto analizzato, comunicandogli prontamente e in via confidenziale le vulnerabilitÃ  scoperte, in modo che possa replicarle e produrre una contromisura (patch) entro 90 giorni dalla notifica ricevuta.

In seguito al rilascio della contromisura (patch), oppure trascorsi i 90 giorni dalla segnalazione, si procede alla pubblicazione, classificando le vulnerabilitÃ  sul Mitre (CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Analoghe azioni vengono intraprese nellâambito dei processi di Security Testing e Gestione Incidenti (Incident Handling) di TIM, qualora portino a scoprire vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora note al produttore e alla comunitÃ .

### CVE-2024-52949â iptraf-ng

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CWE-121

**Software Version**: 1.2.1

**NIST**: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52949

**CVSS**:

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function). Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

During an assessment we fuzzed the -C argument with AFL++ with the following command

sudo ./afl-fuzz -i /in -o /out -- ./iptraf-ng -C @@

The /in directory contains various types of playlists that AFL can fuzz and iterate over. After one day of fuzzing, we found 4 types of config that crash iptraf-ng. The issue consistently occurs in the strcpy function doesnât control the size and is possible to overflow memory in the stack

### CVE-2024-49351â IBM Workload Scheduler

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Plaintext Storage of a Password- CWE-256

**Software Version:** 9.5.0

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49351>

**CVSS:**5.5

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Alberto Arganese, Cristian Castrechini, Federico Draghelli, Massimiliano Brolli

An Improper Password Storage vulnerability exists in the connection properties panel under the Administration tab. This flaw allows authenticated remote attackers with administrator privileges to access and read the engine connection password in cleartext.

**Security impact**

Attackers who obtain this information can gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems, potentially escalating privileges and compromising data. This exposure can further enable lateral movement within the network, increasing the attack surface. Ultimately, it undermines the integrity of the entire system, leading to potential data breaches and reputational damage.

### CVE-2024-9329 â Eclipse Glassfish

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Improper Handling of Parameters - CWE-233

**Software Version:** 7.0.15

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9329>

**CVSS:** 6.1

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Marco Ventura, Claudia Bartolini, Andrea Carlo Maria Dattola, Debora Esposito, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/management/domain'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /management/domain endpoint is requested via an HTTP GET request.

**Affected Endpoints**

URL: https://[IP]:[PORT]/management/domain

HTTP Parameter: Host

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/responsible-disclosure/HostParam.jpg)

Figure 2: payload and evidence

[Click To Enlarge](https://www.gruppotim.it/content/dam/gt/footer/responsible-disclosure/HostChangedVuln.jpg)

To perform this attack, the attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.

Security Impact

An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behaviour can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.

### CVE-2024-9054 â Microchip TP4100

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: RCE on file configuration parameter - CWE-78

**Software Version**: 2.3.12

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9054>

**CVSS**: 8.8

**Severity:** High

**Credits**: Armando Huesca Prida, Marco Negro, Antonio Carriero, Vito Pistillo, Davide Renna, Manuel Leone, Massimiliano Brolli

The device doesn't correctly sanitize parameters content of the configuration file. An attacker able to upload a new configuration file could insert in the parameter 'secret\_key' malicious bash commands that will be executed by the device.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user has got a configuration file or can download it from the device web GUI . This user could locally modify the content of this file because it is in cleartext. Specifically, a bash command could be inserted in a parameter (âshared\_keyâ) present in the xml structure of the file. Once this file is loaded, after authentication, through the web GUI, the device executes the command inserted.

**Affected Endpoints**

**URL:** http://<device\_IP>/config\_restore

**XML Parameter:** secret\_key

Below the evidence with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

POST /config\_restore HTTP/1.1

[Click To Enlarge](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/9054/RCE.jpg)

**Security Impact**

A malicious user with the access to the web GUI of the device could insert a bash command to construct a reverse shell to the device and to control it. Another situation could be represented by a malicious user that reaches the device network and knows the structure of the configuration file, that, through social engineering techniques, forces a user with access to the web GUI to load the infected file and to reach the same objective reported above.

In OpenTextâ¢ Operations Agent, version 12.20, 12.21, 12.22, 12.23, 12.24, 12.25 and 12.26, is possible to perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with the vulnerable application. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user that has the permissions to modify the agent configuration file, can perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. In particular, by adding a malicious payload within the CORE\_ID value, the attacker can inject an arbitrary javascript code in the HTML page.

### CVE-2024-31843â Italtel Embrace

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - CWE-78

**Software Version**: 1.6.4

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31843>

**CVSv3**:

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Luca Carbone, Fabio Romano, Federico Draghelli, Federico Draghelli, Massimiliano Brolli

The Web application does not properly check the parameters sent as input before they are processed on the server side. This allows authenticated users  to execute commands on the Operating System.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application does not properly check the parameters sent as input before they are used to construct an OS command that will be executed on the operating system of the server. Due to the lack of validation of user input, an attacker is allowed to replace and inject arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the application user. This vulnerability is âblindâ, meaning that the output of the command is not reflected in the server response.

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

**CVSSv3**:

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Luca Carbone, Fabio Romano, Stefano Scipioni, Massimiliano Brolli

Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML into HTTP/POST parameter which store the user input without sanitization.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The Web application does not properly check the parameters sent as input from clients before they are re-included within the HTTP pages returned by the application. In particular, the web gui is affected by stored type of this vulnerability. Due to the lack of validation of user input, it allows an attacker to modify the HTML code and the expected execution flow could be altered. The attack can be performed without authentication.

**Affected Endpoints**

Â·       **URL:** https://[HOST]/[NODE-NAME]/IMCSCI-WebGui /j\_security\_check

o   **HTTP POST Parameter:** j\_username

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

**URL:** https://[HOST]/[NODE-NAME]/IMCSCI-WebGui/j\_security\_check

[Click To Enlarge](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/CVE-2024-28804%20-%20figura%201.png)

The endpoint is affected by the **Stored** type of this vulnerability. The first step consists of replacing the value in the âj\_usernameâ POST parameter with the malicious *javascript* code. This value is stored in the application logs and an alert is generated (Authentication failure), which can be displayed by authenticated users. Since this kind of alerts generate a notification on the home page, the *javascript* code is executed as soon as a user logs into the web GUI. This vulnerability is particularly critical since the attacker **does not need any kind of access to the web application** in order to exploit it.

**CVSv3**: **6.5**

**Severity: Medium**

**Credits**: Luca Borzacchiello, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. An Insecure Direct Object Reference can occur under the 5.6.5-3/doc/{ID-FILE]/c/{N]/{C]/websocket endpoint. A malicious unauthenticated user can access cached files in the OnlyOffice backend of other users by guessing the file ID of a target file.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user can fool vShare (through a WebSocket) to return a link to the OnlyOffice

cache of text files, even of other users.

The vulnerability can be exploited in the following way:

1.     the attacker opens a text file in his vShare, this will open a websocket towards vdeskoffice;

2.     the attacker looks at the history of websocket requests, and finds the one that asks for the cached file;

the attacker modifies the ID of its own file with the target one. The target ID could be obtained: (a) performing a brute-force attack (32-bit of entropy), (b) looking at the browser 1.     history of the victim, and looking for a link with the following shape: [...]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID]/... where [ID] is the target file ID.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/CVE-2022-45175_1.png)

Figure 1 Websocket payload with a spoofed "docid" (in yellow). The destination websocket is opened by the attacker and has the following shape: vdeskoffice.[HOST]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID-FILE]/c/[N]/[C]/websocket. Notice that [ID-FILE] is the ID of the file of the attacker, and its different from the one inserted in the body of the websocket.

**CVSv3**: **9.8**

**Severity: Critical**

**Credits**: Antonella Marino, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication for SAML Users can occur under the /login/backup\_code endpoint and the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. The correctness of the TOTP is not checked properly, and can be bypassed by passing any string as the backup code.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application allows a user to set a âBackup Codeâ to be used during the two-factor

authentication (instead of using the TOTP).

Unfortunately, for SAML users, the correctness of the TOTP is not checked correctly, and

can be bypassed passing any string as backup code.

The vulnerability can be exploited directly from the web-ui by:

1.     logging into the vDesk web application as SAML user;

2.     selecting the âbackup codeâ option;

3.     inserting any string in the form.

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. Because only the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response, and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The web application implements two-factor authentication through a TOTP code. To check

whether the inserted TOTP is correct, the web-application implements the API

/api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge. Unfortunately, only the client-side verifies

whether the check was successful, allowing an attacker to modify the response, and fool the

application that the TOTP was correct.

the user.

The vulnerability can be exploited in the following way:

1.     the attacker logs in the victim account (we assume that the attacker knows the credentials of the victim, or has access to the victim logged account);

2.     the attacker list the ID of the files in the vShare of the victim performing a GET

request to https://vdeskbridge.[HOSTNAME]/api/v1/files?path= ;

3.     the attacker performs a POST request to https://vdeskbridge.[HOSTNAME]

/api/v1/vencrypt/decrypt/file specifying the ID of the cyphered file that

he wants to decipher (obtained at 2).

Notice that the same attack is successful if the attacker downloads the cyphered file, upload

it to its own VDESK account, and performs the same POST request at line 3.

### CVE-2022-39822 â NOKIA NFM-T VM Manager WebUI

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') â CWE-89

**Software Version**: R19.9

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39822>

**CVSv3**: **8.8**

**Severity: High**

**Credits**: Luca Di Giuseppe, Alessandro Bosco, Stefano Scipioni, Massimiliano Brolli

The Web Application is affected by SQL Injection vulnerability. Through the injection of arbitrary SQL statements, a potential attacker can modify query syntax and perform unauthorized (and unexpected) operations against the remote database.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user, authenticated to the web application may manipulate the request parameters to exploit error output from the database to manipulate its data. It manipulates the database into generating an error that informs the actor of the databaseâs structure and afterwards extracts the data contents in the database statement. Please see the examples below for step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.

**Affected Endpoints**

Â·       **URL:** https://<host>/cgi-bin/R19.9/easy1350.pl?action=edit\_master&session=[REDACTED]&id=1host=1

Â·       **HTTP Parameter:** id, host

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

**CVSv3**: **6,1**

**Severity: Medium**

**Credits**: Luca Carbone, Fabio Romano, Stefano Scipioni, Massimiliano Brolli

Italtel NetMatch-S CI 5.2.0-20211008 allows Multiple Reflected/Stored XSS issues under NMSCIWebGui/j\_security\_check via the j\_username parameter, or NMSCIWebGui/actloglineview.jsp via the name or actLine parameter. An attacker leveraging this vulnerability could inject arbitrary JavaScript. The payload would then be triggered every time an authenticated user browses the page containing it.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC.**

The Web application does not properly check the parameters sent as input from clients before they are re-included within the HTTP pages returned by the application. In particular, the web gui is affected by both the stored and reflected type of this vulnerability. Due to the lack of validation of user input, it allows an attacker to modify the HTML code and the expected execution flow could be altered. The attack can be performed both pre and post authentication.

**Affected Endpoints**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

/SecurityManagement/html/createuser.jsf in Nokia NetAct 22 allows CSRF. A remote attacker is able to create users with arbitrary privileges, even administrative privileges. The application (even if it implements a CSRF token for the random GET request) does not ever verify a CSRF token. With a little help of social engineering/phishing (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

### CVE-2021-41555 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting - CWE-79

**Software Version:** 21.3.3.815

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41555>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), XSS occurs in **/archibus/dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr** because the data received as input from clients is re-included within the HTTP response returned by the application without adequate validation. In this way, if HTML code or client-side executable code (e.g., Javascript) is entered as input, the expected execution flow could be altered. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-41554 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Broken Access Control- CWE-284

**Software Version:** 21.3.3.815

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41554>

**CVSv3: 8.8

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints:

**/archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw**. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page.  This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-41553 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

**CVSv3: 9.8

Severity**: **Critical

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), the Web Application in **/archibus/login.axvw** assign a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was therefore possible to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the **JSESSIONID** field. The application, following the login, does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-38123 â Micro Focus Network Automation

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Open Redirect - CWE-601

**Software Version:** <= 2019.05

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38123>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/device.save.do'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /device.save.do endpoint is requested via an HTTP POST request.

To exploit the vulnerability, the following HTTP request is used:

POST /device.save.do HTTP/1.1

Host: this.is.my.domain.evil.net

Cache-Control: no-cache

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Origin: https://hostname

Connection: close

Referer: https://hostname/device.edit.do?deviceID=201

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 0

An attacker can send a link containing JavaScript code that allows a user who runs the code to be automatically redirected to a domain owned by the attacker himself.

The redirect is performed via the HTTP **Location** response header.

### CVE-2021-35492 â Wowza Streaming Engine

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:**Â Uncontrolled Resource Consumption â CWE-400

A remote user, authenticated to the Wowza Streaming Engine web interface, through **Virtual Host Monitoring** section, could exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected application. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting random virtual host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.

To exploit the vulnerability, intercept the browser session with a proxy like Burp Suite.

Then, go to the **Virtual Host Monitoring** section:

![CVE-2021-35492-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

*FigureÂ 1: DoS - Virtual Host Monitoring - Web Interface*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

An HTTP request will be automatically performed to view the historical data of the default virtual host.

The request on Burp Suite will be like the next screenshot.

![CVE-2021-35492-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

*FigureÂ 2: DoS - Regular HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

Every time virtual host monitoring data is requested, a new file is created or appended on the filesystem.

By default, this is the starting condition on the folder /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine-4.8.11+5/stats/:

![CVE-2021-35492-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

*FigureÂ 3: DoS - Filesystem on normal condition*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

The attack can be performed using Burp Repeater, using the same request captured with the proxy, changing only the **vhost** parameter value. The response will be **HTTP 200 OK**:

![CVE-2021-35492-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

*FigureÂ 4: DoS - New virtual host HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

Alternatively, the same can be achieved with the following payload:

GET /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata?vhost=\_defaultVHost\_pippo\_&periodStart=2021-06-03T13%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&periodEnd=2021-06-03T14%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&\_=1622724285834 HTTP/1.1

On the filesystem side, a new file of 280 KB will be created, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![CVE-2021-35492-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

*FigureÂ 5: DoS - New virtual host file on the filesystem*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

To massively exploit this condition, multiple requests with different **vhost** values have to be sent.

To send those requests reliably, the browser session has to be left active.

Session timeout can be prevented by installing a browser plugin like **Tab Reloader** and configure it to refresh the tab every 1 minute, like the following example:

![CVE-2021-35492-6](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

*FigureÂ 6: DoS - Session timeout prevention - Tab Reloader*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

Then it is possible to create a custom script to randomize the vhost parameter to a new value to be sent every time.

./dos-exploit-wse.py

When executing such tool, it is possible to exhaust the filesystem by creating **5.5 GB** of files every **30 minutes**.

The effect can be summarized on the following screenshot, which depicts multiple files created on the filesystem and the difference of the **stats** directory size after 30 minutes of the tool execution:

![CVE-2021-35492-7](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-7.png)

### CVE-2021-35491 â Wowza Streaming Engine

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352

**Software Version:** <= 4.8.11+5

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35491>

**CVSv3: 8.1

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote attacker is able to delete a user without the victim's knowledge, by enticing an authenticated admin user to visit an attacker's web page. The application does not implement a CSRF token for the GET request. An attacker can craft an HTML page with a forged request on /enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm URL and send it to the victim.

Prerequisites: None.

Step-by-step instructions and PoC

An authenticated user that visits a crafted HTML page with a forged request can delete a user on Wowza Streaming Engine on behalf of an administrator.

To exploit the vulnerability, a new user needs to be created for testing purpose.

First, create a new user from **Server** -> **Users** -> **Add User**.

![CVE-2021-35491-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

*Figure 1: CSRF - User creation*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

Then, **copy** the following HTML to a file served on another machine, in this case a local Kali Linux, in the file: /var/www/html/csrf-delete-user.html

<html>

     <body>

          <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>

          <form action="http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm">

               <input type="hidden" name="userName" value="pippo" />

               <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />

          </form>

     </body>

</html>

Enable the local web server on the attacker machine:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

From an authenticated browser session to Wowza Streaming Engine with administrative privileges, open a new tab and go to the page http://127.0.0.1/csrf-delete-user.html.

![CVE-2021-35491-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

*Figure 2: CSRF - PoC HTML page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

Select **Submit request**, to force the administrator to delete the selected user.

The request will be sent to the web application, and the user will be deleted:

*Figure 3: CSRF - User deleted*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-3.png)

It was also found that the **wowzaSecurityToken** HTTP parameter is not present in this GET request. In this case, the application accepts the request and processes it every time.

This is not true in the case of user creation, where that parameter is present and correctly validated.

### CVE-2021-35488 â Thruk

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting - CWE-79

**Software Version:** <= 2.40-2

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35488>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Bosco, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

Thruk version 2.40-2 allows /thruk/#cgi-bin/status.cgi?style=combined&title=[TITLE] Reflected XSS on 'host' and 'title' parameters. A malicious user leveraging this vulnerability could inject arbitrary JavaScript into **status.cgi**. The malicious payload will then be triggered every time an authenticated user browses the page containing it.

The vulnerable functionality can be reached through the following URLs:

* /thruk/#cgi-bin/status.cgi?host=[HOSTNAME]&style=detail
* /thruk/#cgi-bin/status.cgi?style=combined&title=[TITLE]

A PoC is possible inserting the malicious payload in one of the host or title fields (GET Request):

* --></script><script>alert(1337)</script>

This occurs due to the closure of a comment, as demonstrated in the next screenshot.

### CVE-2021-35487 â Nokia Broadcast Message Center

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Boolean Blind SQL Injection - CWE-89

**Software Version:** <= 11.1.0

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35487>

**CVSv3: 6.5

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Marco Raimondi, Francesco Pigini, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote user, authenticated on the Broadcast Message Center, can navigate the application in the ALERTS --> Manage Alerts section. Within Search Options it is possible to select Basic Search and by specifying the **extIdentifier** parameter, arbitrary queries in the application database can be executed.

Through these queries it is possible to extrapolate arbitrary information, not foreseen by the application logic, such as the user of the system that executes the queries, the dbms version, etc.

Depending on the permissions the user has on the database, different types of queries are possible and consequently different types of information can be extracted.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![CVE-2021-35487-0](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

*Figure 0: Payload*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

This first step consisted of inserting a single quote (') inside the search bar, in order to evaluate the behavior of the application. The result was an error message inside the database:

![CVE-2021-35487-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

*Figure 1: Single quote database error message*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

At this point we tried to see if it was possible to execute arbitrary queries on the application. In this specific case, we tried to get the name of the user who executes the queries on the database. To do this we combined the **mid()** and **user()** functions. Being a Blind SQL Injection, if the query result was "true" we would get all the database alerts, otherwise we would get nothing, and we would have to go on with the letters of the alphabet:

![CVE-2021-35487-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-2.png)

*Figure 2: True query request*

![CVE-2021-35487-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

*Figure 3:Â True query page behavior with alarms*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

The result of the query is the entire list of alarms, so the first letter of the username is after "**m**" in the alphabet.

![CVE-2021-35487-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

*Figure 4:Â False query page behavior*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

Using the letter **n**" we get nothing. Therefore, the first letter of the username is "**n**". Proceeding in this way it is possible to obtain the full name of the user.

At this point we try to confirm the username found by using the **user()** function directly:

![CVE-2021-35487-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-5.png)

*Figure 5:Â User() function true request*

*Figure 6:Â User() function true response page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-6.png)

As we can see from the last image, using only the user() function with the name found from the previous steps, we get again the complete list of alarms, confirming that the username is correct.

Similarly, it is possible to proceed to get more information from the database.

**Vulnerability Description:**Â Unrestricted File Upload

An authenticated user with access to the CDP component of NOKIA IMPACT is able to upload files with arbitrary extensions.

TheÂ **deviceImport**Â function parses every file received with aÂ **csv\_parse**Â function. We managed to load a non-csv file adding at the beginning of it the following line followed by our payload.

We uploaded PHP Webshell in a path served by Apache (in our case /opt/[redacted]/5/) and got code execution as apache user.
