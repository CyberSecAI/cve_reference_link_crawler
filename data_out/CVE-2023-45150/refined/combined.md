# Inviting excessive long email addresses to a calendar event makes the server unresponsive

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-r936-8gwm-w452
Oct 16, 2023

## Package

Calendar
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0

## Patched versions

4.4.4

## Description

### Impact

Due to missing precondition checks the server was trying to validate strings of any length as email addresses even when megabytes of data were provided, eventually making the server busy and unresponsive.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Calendar app is upgraded to 4.4.4

### Workarounds

* Disable app calendar

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/2058337)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
