|  |  | - ❗ Turned feature name validation check to a hard error. The warning was |
|  |  | added in Rust 1.49. These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io, so |
|  |  | this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish |
|  |  | to a registry. |
|  |  | - [CVE-2023-40030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-wrrj-h57r-vx9p): |
|  |  | Malicious dependencies can inject arbitrary JavaScript into cargo-generated timing reports. |
|  |  | To mitigate this, feature name validation check is now turned into a hard error. |
