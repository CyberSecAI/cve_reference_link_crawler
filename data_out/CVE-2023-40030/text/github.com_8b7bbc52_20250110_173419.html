This converts the feature name validation check from a warning to an error. This was added in [#8814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814) in Rust 1.49 released in 2020-12-31 (about 2.5 years ago) with a warning that it will become a hard error in the future.

These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io, so this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish to a registry. The warning message requested anyone impacted by it to let us know. We got one report, and added support for . as result. Since there weren't any other reports, I think it should be pretty safe to move forward.

The diff here is a little large because it removes the pass-through of `config` since it isn't needed anymore.

Additionally, the tests were restructured since testing every edge case in an integration test has a lot of overhead. Instead, there is now a unit test which runs much faster, with the integration test just verifying that it fires and checks the two forms of error messages.

Closes [#8813](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8813)

Sorry, something went wrong.

- [Add search result item types after their name](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110688/)

- [Clean up type unification and \"unboxing\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112233/)

Stabilized APIs
---------------

- [`impl<T: Send> Sync for mpsc::Sender<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#impl-Sync-for-Sender%3CT%3E)
- [`impl TryFrom<&OsStr> for &str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html#impl-TryFrom%3C%26'a+OsStr%3E-for-%26'a+str)
- [`String::leak`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/string/struct.String.html#method.leak)

These APIs are now stable in const contexts:

- [`CStr::from_bytes_with_nul`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_bytes_with_nul`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)

Cargo
-----

- Enable `-Zdoctest-in-workspace` by default. When running each documentation
  test, the working directory is set to the root directory of the package the
  test belongs to.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html#working-directory-of-tests)
  [#12221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12221)
  [#12288](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12288)
- Add support of the \"default\" keyword to reset previously set `build.jobs`
  parallelism back to the default.
  [#12222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12222)

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

- [Alter `Display` for `Ipv6Addr` for IPv4-compatible addresses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112606/)
- Cargo changed feature name validation check to a hard error. The warning was
  added in Rust 1.49. These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io, so
  this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish
  to a registry.
  [#12291](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12291)

Refreshed patches.

- [Clean up type unification and \"unboxing\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112233/)

Stabilized APIs
---------------
- [`impl<T: Send> Sync for mpsc::Sender<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#impl-Sync-for-Sender%3CT%3E)
- [`impl TryFrom<&OsStr> for &str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html#impl-TryFrom%3C%26'a+OsStr%3E-for-%26'a+str)
- [`String::leak`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/string/struct.String.html#method.leak)

These APIs are now stable in const contexts:

- [`CStr::from_bytes_with_nul`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_bytes`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_bytes_with_nul`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)
- [`CStr::to_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul)

Cargo
-----
- Enable `-Zdoctest-in-workspace` by default. When running each documentation
  test, the working directory is set to the root directory of the package the
  test belongs to.
  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html#working-directory-of-tests)
  [#12221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12221)
  [#12288](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12288)
- Add support of the \"default\" keyword to reset previously set `build.jobs`
  parallelism back to the default.
  [#12222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12222)

Compatibility Notes
-------------------
- [Alter `Display` for `Ipv6Addr` for IPv4-compatible addresses](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112606/)
- Cargo changed feature name validation check to a hard error. The warning was
  added in Rust 1.49. These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io, so
  this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish
  to a registry.
  [#12291](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12291)

Refreshed patches.
