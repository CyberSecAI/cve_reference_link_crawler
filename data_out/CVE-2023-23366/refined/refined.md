- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can read the contents of unexpected files, potentially exposing sensitive data via the network.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
