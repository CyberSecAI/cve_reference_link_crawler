Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user input in the `login.php` file. Specifically, the "username" parameter is used directly in SQL queries without any cleaning, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `login.php` file of the "Patient Record Management System In PHP With Source Code"
- The application is vulnerable to both time-based and boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- Lack of input sanitization and validation on the "username" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage is possible.
- Data can be modified or deleted.
- Comprehensive system control and service interruption could occur.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `login.php` script, specifically the `username` parameter.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through HTTP POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `login.php` page.
- No login verification is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- No specific position is mentioned, implying the attacker could be external or have some level of network access.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) using `sqlmap`, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited using both time-based and boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- Example payloads for both types of blind SQL injection are provided.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Patient Record Management System In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The Github issue link is provided as a source.
- Remediation suggestions include: using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
- The vulnerability is located in the `login.php` file of the application.
