Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-20143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to the lack of an OEM configurable limit for zen rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The absence of a configurable limit on zen rules leads to a potential denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, an attacker could potentially create an excessive number of zen rules, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a denial of service. A large number of zen rules could consume resources, making the device unresponsive or unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by creating an excessive number of zen rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the capability to create zen rules on the affected device. No further privileges are specified in the description, suggesting a user-level or app-level attack may be possible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is described as "Add an OEM configurable limit for zen rules." This suggests that OEMs can now define the maximum number of zen rules, preventing resource exhaustion due to an excessive number of rules.
- The commit message includes a test reference which suggests that a test was added to verify the fix.
