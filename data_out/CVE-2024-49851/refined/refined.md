Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper cleanup in the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) space within the Linux kernel's TPM driver. Specifically, the `tpm_dev_transmit` function prepares the TPM space before sending a command, but if the command fails, it does not revert the preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Resource Leak:** The primary weakness is a resource leak of transient TPM handles. If a command transmission fails, the allocated resources within the TPM space are not released.
- **Lack of Rollback:** The code lacks a mechanism to roll back the TPM space preparation in case of command failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Handle Leakage:** Repeated command failures can lead to a leak of transient handles.
- **Device Unusability:** If a sufficient number of handles are leaked, the device may become unusable until a device reset.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Triggering Command Failures:** The attack vector involves sending commands to the TPM that are designed to fail.
- **Repeated Transmissions:** Repeated failed command transmissions are needed to trigger the resource leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Interact with TPM Device:** The attacker needs the capability to send commands to the TPM device.
- **Privileged Access (Potentially):** The attacker would need to have the necessary access rights to communicate with the TPM device. The specific privileges required would depend on the device configuration.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves calling `tpm2_flush_space(chip)` in `tpm_dev_transmit` when a command fails and there is a non zero return.
- The `tpm2_flush_space` function now includes a check to ensure that the space pointer is valid. This avoids a potential null dereference.
- The `tpm2_flush_space` iterates over the `context_tbl` to find and flush all active contexts.
