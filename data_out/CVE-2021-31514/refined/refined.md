Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-31514

**Description:** This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of OpenText Brava! Desktop.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of CGM files within OpenText Brava! Desktop. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during CGM file processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The lack of proper input validation can lead to a write operation beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions and lead to unexpected program behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently running process. This could potentially give the attacker complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The attacker can craft a malicious CGM file that triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable version of OpenText Brava! Desktop.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that forces the user to open the malicious file or otherwise exploit the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target must either open a malicious CGM file or visit a malicious website.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote as long as the malicious file can be delivered to the user.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-04-16
