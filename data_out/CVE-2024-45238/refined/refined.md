Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45238:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a malformed `subjectPublicKey` within an RPKI resource certificate. Specifically, the certificate contains a bit string that does not decode into a valid Subject Public Key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a lack of proper input validation by Fort when handling the malformed `subjectPublicKey`.
- Fort was recklessly dereferencing a pointer when compiled with OpenSSL libcrypto versions below 3. OpenSSL does not report this issue during parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the Fort validator application.
- Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious RPKI repository, which descends from a trusted Trust Anchor, can serve the crafted resource certificate via rsync or RRDP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control or manipulate an RPKI repository that is trusted by the Fort validator.
- The attacker can introduce a malformed certificate to trigger the vulnerability when the Fort validator processes it.
