[May 2, 2024](https://insinuator.net/2024/05/vulnerability-in-jitsi-meet-meeting-password-disclosure-affecting-meetings-with-lobbies/) by [Florian Port](https://insinuator.net/author/fport/)
# Vulnerability in Jitsi Meet: Meeting Password Disclosure affecting Meetings with Lobbies

During a customer project, we identified a logic flaw in [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/), an open-source video conferencing and messaging platform for secure video conferencing, voice calls, and messaging. The vulnerability affects password protected Jitsi meetings that make use of a lobby. This logic flaw leads to the disclosure of the meeting password when a user is invited to the call after waiting in the lobby.

Jitsi offers two security options to meeting moderators. Firstly, the meeting can be assigned a password that must be entered when joining. Secondly, a lobby mode can be activated, which first adds joining users to a lobby, from where they can then be added to the meeting by a user with moderation permissions.

## Technical Background

Jitsi uses the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](https://xmpp.org/de/), an open-standard communication protocol designed for instant messaging and real-time communication over the Internet for inter-component communication. Many functionalities are offered directly by the XMPP standard, such as [multi-user chats (*MUC*)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) via which the chat within a video conference is mapped. [Password protected rooms](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#enter-pw) are also implemented directly with XMPP. A preceding lobby, however, is not included within the specification of the protocol. Nevertheless, Jitsi uses XMPP functionality to implement it.

For this purpose, [*Members-Only Rooms*](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#enter-members) are being used. When the lobby mode is activated, two things happen conceptually:

* First, all conference participants become members of the room, and,
* Second, another *MUC* (the lobby) is associated with the conference.

If a user is invited from the lobby to the video conference, they become a member of the room.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

In the case of a room with a lobby and password, the room is a *MUC* with password protection and *Members-Only* access. When a user is invited to a meeting via the lobby, the user receives the following XMPP message via web sockets from the server stating that the request to join has been approved:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<message xmlns="jabber:client" to="931c6c9a-5883-459a-b392-c798125b6279@meet.jitsi/iSXOTxy3rb-0" from="vulndemoernw@muc.meet.jitsi" xml:lang="en" id="50a2a698-4f85-423b-8bd1-949a29f4df64:sendIQ">
  <x xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user">
    <invite from="d7806e0d-1401-4599-b8aa-8b24b5fc446a@meet.jitsi/vVh9WLXtoMRQ">
    <reason/>
    </invite>
    <password>ernw123</password>
  </x>
  <body>d7806e0d-1401-4599-b8aa-8b24b5fc446a@meet.jitsi/vVh9WLXtoMRQ invited you to the room vulndemoernw@muc.meet.jitsi</body>
  <x xmlns="jabber:x:conference" jid="vulndemoernw@muc.meet.jitsi"/>
</message>
```

The response discloses the meeting password `ernw123`. This is in alignment with the XMPP specification for [mediated invites](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html#invite-mediated) in multi-user-chats.

Usually, this would not be a problem as XMPP requires that participants must have both the password and the *Member* status to join a password-protected *Members-Only* meeting. But this is where Jitsi deviates from the XMPP standard – it automatically makes users members of the meeting if they join by simply providing the password.

By gaining knowledge of the meeting password, users that have been invited to a password-protected meeting can grant meeting access to other users, even though they lack moderation rights. The vulnerability was assigned [CVE-2024-33530](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-33530).

## Affected Version

We identified this vulnerability in Jitsi version `2.0.9364` from [March 18, 2024](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable/jitsi-meet_9364). Though, we could also verify that the issue was present in all Jitsi version since the ever first version supporting lobbies which was Jitsi version `1.0.4289` released on [July 12, 2020](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable/jitsi-meet_4857). In these times, the messages were still transmitted using HTTP POST requests instead of web sockets. The vulnerability was fixed in Version `2.0.9457` release on [April 23, 2024](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable/jitsi-meet_9457).

## Disclosure Timeline

* **March 21, 2024:** ERNW provides vulnerability information to Jitsi. Start of 90-day disclosure period.
* **March 23, 2024:** Initial response by Jitsi stating that a [fix](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/14518) is already implemented and merged.
* **March 25, 2024:** ERNW confirms fix with Jitsi unstable build.
* **April 23, 2024:** [Release](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases/tag/stable/jitsi-meet_9457) of Jitsi version `2.0.9457`
* **May 02, 2024:** Disclosure of vulnerability details by ERNW.

Thank you very much for the fast response!

Cheers!
