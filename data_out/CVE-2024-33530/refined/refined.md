The provided content is related to CVE-2024-33530.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A logic flaw in Jitsi Meet's implementation of password-protected meetings with lobbies. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the disclosure of the meeting password within the XMPP message sent to a user invited from the lobby.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The Jitsi implementation of "members-only rooms" deviates from the XMPP standard. It automatically adds users as members to a password-protected meeting simply by providing the password.
- The system transmits the meeting password within the XMPP message to invited users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users can gain access to password-protected meetings if they know the meeting password.
- Invited users, lacking moderation rights, can disclose the meeting password and allow other users access to the meeting.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can join a Jitsi meeting with a lobby, wait to be admitted, intercept the XMPP messages using web sockets, and retrieve the password.
- The attacker can then disseminate this password to unauthorized users allowing them to bypass the lobby and meeting password protection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to a Jitsi meeting.
- They need to be able to intercept the XMPP messages transmitted over web sockets.
- An attacker could also be invited to a meeting to obtain the password.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Jitsi versions since the first implementation of lobbies from version `1.0.4289` released on July 12, 2020 up to version `2.0.9456`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `2.0.9457` released on April 23, 2024.
