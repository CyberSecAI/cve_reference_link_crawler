Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper file extension validation during the staff avatar upload process in the Simple School Management System v1.0. Specifically, the application uses `basename($_FILES["img"]["name"])` which extracts the filename from the uploaded file path, but does not enforce any restrictions on allowed file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files of any type, including malicious scripts like PHP files.
- **Insufficient File Validation:** The application fails to check the file extension or content of uploaded files, allowing any file to be uploaded and potentially executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (webshell) as an avatar, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Server Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete server compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, steal sensitive data, and perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Form:** The vulnerability is triggered via the staff avatar upload form within the application.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can use a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the file upload request, changing the filename parameter to a malicious filename ending with `.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered staff member (or have access to a staff account). The provided proof of concept uses a default user for demonstration.
- **HTTP Interception Tool:** The attacker needs to use a tool like Burp Suite to modify the file upload request during the attack.
