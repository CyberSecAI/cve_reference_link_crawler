The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Rukovoditel v3.2.1, specifically within the `ajax_request.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by manipulating database entries, specifically within the `app_fields` table. The `configuration` field of a `fieldtype_ajax_request` is designed to store configuration data but is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject PHP code for execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker leverages an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability to insert a malicious entry into the `app_fields` table.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not sanitize the `configuration` field for the `fieldtype_ajax_request` type, leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker first needs to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability.
2.  **Database Manipulation:** The attacker uses the SQL injection to insert a malicious entry into the `app_fields` table, where the `type` is `fieldtype_ajax_request`, and the `configuration` field contains arbitrary PHP code to be executed.
3.  **HTTP Request:** An HTTP POST request to `/index.php?module=dashboard/ajax_request&field_id=<injected_id>` is made, triggering the execution of the injected PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to an SQL injection vulnerability within the Rukovoditel application.
*   The attacker needs to obtain a valid `form_session_token` and session cookie of an administrator.
* The attacker should have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
