Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The House Rental Management System is vulnerable to SQL injection in the login functionality. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `username` and `password` parameters used in the `login.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the `username` and `password` fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code that results in a successful login without knowing valid credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited through manipulating the `username` and `password` parameters in an HTTP POST request to the `login.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, specifically to the `login.php` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL is required to craft the injection payload.

**Technical Details**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the SQL injection using the following payload:
-   `username`: `'or 1=1-- -`
-   `password`: `1`

This payload exploits a SQL injection vulnerability. The `'or 1=1-- -` string will alter the SQL query used for authentication and force it to always return true, granting unauthorized access to the application. The `-- -` acts as a comment, discarding the rest of the original query.

The vulnerability exists because the application directly incorporates user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the query logic.
