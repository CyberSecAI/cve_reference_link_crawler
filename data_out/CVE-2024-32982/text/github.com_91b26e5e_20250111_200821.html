Fix for vulnerability introduced in [#739](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/pull/739), caused by failure to normalize the path part extracted from URL before serving data from a static directory.

See [GHSA-83pv-qr33-2vcf](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/security/advisories/GHSA-83pv-qr33-2vcf "GHSA-83pv-qr33-2vcf") for specific details.
