GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC PCS neo is a distributed control system (DCS).

The Siemens Network Planner (SINETPLAN) supports you as a planner of automation systems based on
PROFINET. It facilitates the professional planning, calculation, and simulation of load in a PROFINET
network and supports virtual commissioning of the network. SINETPLAN provides the capability to
efﬁciently plan and layout PROFINET networks. It supports both "non-real-time communication", such as
when TCP/IP data is used, as well as real-time (RT) or IRT communication.

TIA Administrator is a web-based framework that can incorporate different function modules for adminis-
trative tasks, as well as functions for managing SIMATIC software and licenses.

The Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) is a PC software that provides access to the complete
range of Siemens digitalized automation services, from digital planning and integrated engineering to
transparent operation.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
