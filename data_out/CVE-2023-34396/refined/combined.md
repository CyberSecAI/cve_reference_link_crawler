## Summary

DoS via OOM owing to no sanity limit on normal form fields in multipart forms.

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers and users |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Denial of Service |
| Maximum security rating | Important |
| Recommendation | Upgrade to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 6.1.2 |
| Reporters | Matthew McClain |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2023-34396 |

## Problem

When a Multipart request has non-file normal form fields, Struts used to bring them into memory as Strings without checking their sizes. This could lead to OOM if developer has set struts.multipart.maxSize to a value equal or greater than the available memory.

## Solution

Upgrade to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater.

## Backward compatibility

No issues expected when upgrading to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1

## Workaround

Set struts.multipart.maxSize to a value much much smaller than the available memory.
