Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-34396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanity checks on the size of normal form fields within multipart requests in Apache Struts.
*   Specifically, when processing multipart requests with non-file fields, Struts reads these fields into memory as Strings without validating their size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource exhaustion:** The absence of a size limit on normal form fields allows for the consumption of excessive memory.
*   **Lack of input validation:**  Struts does not properly validate the size of form fields before processing them.
*  **Out-of-Memory (OOM):** A large number of fields, or extremely large fields, can lead to an Out of Memory error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by exhausting the available memory, potentially crashing the Struts application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multipart request:** Attackers can craft malicious multipart requests that contain a large number of form fields, or a few extremely large form fields, in order to exhaust the server's memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Struts application.
*  No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, making it exploitable remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Apache Struts versions through 2.5.30 and through 6.1.2.
*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater.
*   A workaround is to set `struts.multipart.maxSize` to a value much smaller than available memory.
