| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2250834#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2023-11-21 11:25:45 UTC  ``` User can specify a smaller meta buffer than what the device is wired to update/access. Kernel makes a copy of the meta buffer into which the device does DMA. As a result, the device overwrites the unrelated kernel memory, causing random kernel crashes.

Seems a valid argument, and Moderate fits quite well: "the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw, and/or affect unlikely configurations" [1]. Updated CVSS score (AC:H) and downgraded impact, thanks!  [1] <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification>   ``` |  |
