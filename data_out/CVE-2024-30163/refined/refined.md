Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-30163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input within the `store.php` script of Invision Community, specifically in the `_store::_categoryView()` method. The `filter` request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** User-controlled data from the `filter` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit the lack of sanitization to perform time-based or error-based blind SQL injection attacks.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can be further leveraged to reset user passwords and gain unauthorized access to the AdminCP.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Gaining AdminCP access could ultimately allow for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is the `filter` request parameter within HTTP requests targeting the `store.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Nexus Application Installed:** The "nexus" application needs to be installed and configured with at least one "Product Group".
