Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the Booking Ultra Pro Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin for WordPress. Specifically, multiple AJAX functions, such as `save_fields_settings`, `bup_delete_user_avatar`, and `bup_crop_avatar_user_profile_image`, lack proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of capability checks on AJAX functions, allowing unauthorized users to access and modify plugin settings.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to modify data via AJAX requests without proper authorization suggests that the AJAX endpoints are vulnerable to insecure direct object references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** Authenticated attackers (Subscriber level and above) can modify various plugin options and data, including:
    - Payment settings
    - Pricing information
    - Booking details
    - Business hours
    - Calendars
    - Profile information
    - Email templates
- **Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete data, such as user avatars.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Modifying sensitive settings could potentially lead to further exploitation or compromise of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **AJAX Requests:** Attackers send crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable functions to modify plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least Subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.1.13 of the plugin.
