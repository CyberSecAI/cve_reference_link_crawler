The content is related to CVE-2023-39348.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper log output when using GitHub Status Notifications. The log level is always set to FULL, causing sensitive information, like GitHub tokens, to be logged.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Logging of sensitive information (GitHub tokens)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of GitHub tokens which could grant elevated access to repositories outside of control.
- If using READ restricted tokens, the exposure is such that the token itself could be used to access resources otherwise restricted from reads.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the log system, or unauthorized access to the logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker with access to the logs could potentially obtain the GitHub tokens.
