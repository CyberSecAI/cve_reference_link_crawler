Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper access control in the resident process. The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient access restrictions on a resident process within the SKYSEA Client View software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-749:** Improper Control of Interaction Frequency. This indicates that the vulnerability is due to insufficient control over how frequently interactions with the resident process are handled, leading to a security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary processes with `SYSTEM` privileges. This means an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a valid login to the PC where the vulnerable SKYSEA Client View Windows client is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user who can log in to the PC where the SKYSEA Client View client is installed. No specific administrative privileges are mentioned as a prerequisite.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-24964 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in SKYSEA Client View. Due to insufficient access control within a resident process, an attacker who has already logged in to the machine, can execute arbitrary code with `SYSTEM` privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.
