Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of protocol-relative URLs when loading external images. Even when the configuration is set to block external images, the application fails to block requests using protocol-relative URLs (e.g., `//example.com/image.png`).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a bypass of the configured restriction on loading external images. This leads to a vulnerability where an attacker can force the application to make requests to external servers, even when it should be blocked. The vulnerability falls under CWE-200, which is the Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can retrieve the IP address of the user viewing the malicious content. The impact is classified as "low", since only information exposure occurs. 

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a payload that contains a protocol-relative URL pointing to an external image server and injecting that payload where it can be viewed by a user.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges. The attacker simply needs to be able to inject the malicious protocol-relative URL into a location where it will be rendered in the application and viewed by the victim.

*   **Affected Product Versions:**
    *   OTRS 7.0.x before 7.0.47
    *   OTRS 8.0.x before 8.0.37
    *   ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6.0.x through 6.0.34

*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade OTRS to version 7.0.47, 8.0.37 or later.

This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2023-38059.
