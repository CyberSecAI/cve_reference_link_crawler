Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit message "fix: validate access token" and the code diff in `server/jwt.go` indicate that the vulnerability was due to improper access token validation. Specifically, the code was missing checks for access token validity and audience claims, which could lead to an unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Access Token Validation:** The original code lacked proper validation of JWT access tokens. This included checks to ensure that the token is not expired, and that its "audience" claim matches the expected value for the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By providing an invalid or manipulated access token, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application. This could lead to various impacts, depending on what the attacker is able to do within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulated JWT:** An attacker could craft a JWT with an invalid signature, an expired date, or an audience that doesn't match the application's requirements. Without proper validation, the application may mistakenly treat such a token as valid.
*   **Replay attack:** If token expiry wasn't being checked and if the token was leaked somehow, it could be replayed by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft or obtain a JWT that is either invalid, expired, or has a mismatched audience to bypass authentication.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to make requests to the server.
