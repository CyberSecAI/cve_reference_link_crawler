Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6550

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Gravity Forms: Multiple Form Instances plugin for WordPress leaving test files with `display_errors` enabled. This causes the full path of the web application to be exposed in error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Full Path Disclosure: The plugin's test files inadvertently expose the server's full file path due to `display_errors` being turned on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An unauthenticated attacker can retrieve the full path of the web application.
- Aid to Other Attacks: While the full path itself is not directly damaging, it can be used to assist in other attacks by providing critical information about the server's file system structure. The exposed path might be valuable for attackers attempting other exploits or looking for specific files/configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated HTTP requests to test files within the plugin directory

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no special privileges, and does not need to be logged in to the WordPress site. They can be anywhere on the internet, and simply need to send a request to the vulnerable plugin files that contain the error information.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.2, by removing the vulnerable test files.
- The Wordfence article specifies that this vulnerability is not damaging on its own, but can help facilitate other attacks.
