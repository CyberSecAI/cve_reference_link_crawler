At the Bluetooth SIG, we strive to make Bluetooth the global standard for simple, secure wireless connectivity and security is of the utmost importance.  If you have found a potential security issue in any Bluetooth specification, please contact us via email at security@bluetooth.com.  For encrypted communication, you may use our [public key](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/pgp-key/).

We do our best to respond to security issues within 48 hours, but if you do not receive a response within this time frame, please feel free to follow up with us to ensure that we have received your original report.

***Report Details***The following information will help us to evaluate your submission as quickly as possible. If available, please include in your report:

* Vulnerability type (security, privacy, availability/DoS, etc.)
* Affected specification and version
* Instructions to reproduce the issue
* A proof-of-concept (PoC)
