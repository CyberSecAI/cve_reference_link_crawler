Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to recursive assignment of properties from source to destination in the `json-override` module. The module does not properly sanitize or validate keys, leading to prototype pollution when an attacker provides `__proto__` as a key in the source object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The module allows modification of the `__proto__` object, affecting all objects inheriting from it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: By modifying the prototype, attackers could cause unexpected behavior and potentially crash applications.
- Remote code execution: Depending on the application, prototype pollution could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.
- Cross-site scripting: It could also potentially lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if the polluted prototypes are used in a way that allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to supply a crafted JSON object with `__proto__` as a key to the `json-override` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to control the input to the `json-override` function in the vulnerable application.

**Additional notes:**
- The maintainer has not provided any updates for the vulnerability two months after reporting, which implies that vulnerable versions are still exposed.
- The vulnerability is located at `json-override/json-override.js:18`.
- The PoC provided clearly demonstrates the ability to pollute the prototype by injecting the `polluted` property.
