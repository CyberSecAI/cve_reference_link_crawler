- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of the `next` query parameter in Symantec Identity Portal 14.4.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirection (DOM-based) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect an authenticated user to a malicious website by manipulating the `next` query parameter. This could be used for phishing or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `next` query parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL before the user clicks on it. The user needs to be authenticated to the application. An authenticated user can see and modify the value for the 'next' query parameter. The CVSS score indicates that the attack requires high privileges on the application, and user interaction is also needed for the attack to be successful.
