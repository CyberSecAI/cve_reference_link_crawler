The provided content is related to a commit that addresses session management in the `icms2` project. Specifically, it introduces session regeneration after login and logout and sets the "secure" flag for cookies if HTTPS is used. This commit is relevant to security but it does not appear to describe a vulnerability.

Based on the information in this commit:

- **Root cause of the change**: The commit aims to enhance session security by regenerating the session ID upon login and logout to prevent session fixation attacks. Additionally, it sets the secure flag on cookies when the connection is HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The commit description suggests a potential vulnerability related to session management and cookie security prior to this change. Without this change, there is a risk of session fixation and cookies being sent over insecure connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A session fixation attack could allow an attacker to hijack a user's session. Insecure cookies over HTTP can expose cookie data to network eavesdropping.
- **Attack vectors**: Session fixation through lack of session ID regeneration during login/logout. Man-in-the-middle attacks eavesdropping on HTTP traffic to steal cookies.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to trick a user into using a specific session ID or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to steal cookies sent over an insecure channel.

The commit itself is not a vulnerability, but rather a fix for an underlying vulnerability.
