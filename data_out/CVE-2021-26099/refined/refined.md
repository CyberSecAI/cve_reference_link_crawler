- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing cryptographic steps in FortiMail's Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper use of cryptographic primitives in the IBE KeyStore, specifically in how the master keys are encrypted. An attacker with possession of the encrypted master keys can observe invariant properties in the ciphertext, which allows compromising the confidentiality of these keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of the confidentiality of the master keys.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have gained access to the encrypted master keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have already gained access to the encrypted master keys, and be able to observe the ciphertext to exploit invariant properties.
