- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize file uploads, allowing users with author privileges to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload, leading to potential command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload malicious PHP files, potentially gaining remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with author privileges and can upload files through the e-Learning widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs author-level access to the WordPress site. They can create a new post, add the e-Learning widget, and upload a specially crafted ZIP file containing a malicious PHP file.
