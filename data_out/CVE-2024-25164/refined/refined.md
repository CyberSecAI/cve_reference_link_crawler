Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation/sanitization in the `/download` endpoint of the iDURAR ERP/CRM software. The application uses parameters provided in the URL to construct the file path for download.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not adequately filter the `directory` and `filename` parameters. This allows attackers to use path traversal sequences like `..%2f` (URL-encoded "../") to access files outside the intended `download` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** By manipulating the directory and filename parameters, an attacker can force the application to read arbitrary files on the server's file system. This could expose sensitive information, such as configuration files, user data, or system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` as shown in the PoC).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted GET request to the `/download` endpoint with malicious directory and filename parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This would typically mean they are on the same network as the server or have access to the server via the internet.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the correct path to the `/download` endpoint and how to manipulate the directory and filename parameters.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided code snippet of `erpDownloadRouter.js` confirms the vulnerability by showing how the parameters are directly used to construct the file path.
* The vulnerability was patched in version `2.1.0` of the application
