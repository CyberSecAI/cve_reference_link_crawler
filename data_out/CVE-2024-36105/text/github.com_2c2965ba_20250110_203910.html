| [@MichelleArk](https://github.com/MichelleArk) While I understand the sanity of having 127.0.0.1 as the default bind address, this broke our k8s deployment because the readiness check cannot pass and I cannot override the bind address because it's hard coded.  Can we add a cli/env flag to override this? |

| Ach, sorry about that! I think an override sounds completely reasonable here, perhaps something like `dbt docs serve --host`.  cc [@jtcohen6](https://github.com/jtcohen6) |

| Makes sense to me! We already support `--port`, so it makes sense to support `--host` as well, with `127.0.0.1` as the default:  ``` $ dbt docs serve --host 127.0.01 --port 8080  ``` |
