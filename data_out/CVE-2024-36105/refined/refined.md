Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-36105:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content directly relates to CVE-2024-36105. It describes a vulnerability where dbt-core, by binding to `INADDR_ANY` or `IN6ADDR_ANY`, exposes the application on all network interfaces, which is the exact issue described in the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the use of `""` as the address when creating a TCP server socket in `dbt docs serve`. This results in binding the server to all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0` for IPv4 or `::` for IPv6), instead of only localhost (`127.0.0.1`).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unrestricted Bind:** The application binds to an unrestricted IP address, making it accessible from any network interface.
   - **Insecure Default:** The default behavior unintentionally exposes the service to a broader network.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker on the same network can access the dbt documentation server without needing to be on the local host.
   - **Data Breaches:** If the documentation server is not adequately secured, unauthorized access could lead to data breaches.
   - **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities:** If vulnerabilities exist within the application, they can be exploited by remote users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone on the same network as the machine running `dbt docs serve`.
   - **Remote Access:** Attackers do not need to be physically present on the machine; they can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the machine hosting the dbt documentation server.
   - **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require special privileges to exploit the vulnerability; it is enough to connect to the exposed service.

**7. Additional details:**
    - The issue was resolved by explicitly binding to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default.
    - The vulnerability was present in dbt-core versions 1.6.114, 1.7.14, and 1.8.0.
    - Patched versions are 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1.
    - The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
    - The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-1327 (Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address).
    - The fix was implemented in pull request #10208 and issue #10209.
    - It was initially reported by Ericwb.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from the use of a wildcard address for the `dbt docs serve` command, which unintentionally exposed the documentation server to the wider network and has been corrected by explicitly binding to localhost by default in patched versions.
