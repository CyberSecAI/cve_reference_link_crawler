# Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - BACKDROP-SA-CORE-2024-001

Date: Wednesday, Jul 3rd, 2024Advisory ID: BACKDROP-SA-CORE-2024-001Security risk: Moderately Critical
Vulnerability:
Cross Site Scripting

CVE ID:
[CVE-2024-41709](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-41709)

Versions affected:

* Backdrop Core 1.28.x versions prior to 1.28.2
* Backdrop Core 1.27.x versions prior to 1.27.3

Backdrop versions 1.26 and prior do not receive security coverage.

Description:

Backdrop CMS doesn't sufficiently sanitize field labels before they are displayed in certain places.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission "administer fields".

Solution:

Upgrade your site to the most recent version of Backdrop core. Download available on the [Backdrop CMS 1.28.2 release page](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/releases/tag/1.28.2). See the [update instructions](https://backdropcms.org/upgrade#from-previous-versions), if needed.
