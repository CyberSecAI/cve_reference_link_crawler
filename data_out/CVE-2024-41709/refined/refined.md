- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not sufficiently sanitize field labels before displaying them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed in the browsers of other users.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker would need to modify field labels to inject malicious scripts, which are displayed in certain places.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have a role with the "administer fields" permission.
