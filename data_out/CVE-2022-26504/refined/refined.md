Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe` process, which is used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) integration, allows authentication using non-administrative domain credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authentication: The process does not enforce proper authorization, allowing non-administrative domain users to authenticate.
- Remote code execution: A remote attacker can exploit this authentication flaw to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Gaining control over the target system: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected Veeam Backup & Replication server.
- Potential compromise of the backup infrastructure and data it protects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: A remote attacker can connect to the vulnerable process over TCP port 8732 (default).
- Exploitation of authentication flaw: The attacker uses non-administrative domain credentials to authenticate to the vulnerable process, then executes malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network connectivity to the target Veeam server with SCVMM integration.
- Valid domain user credentials (non-administrative are sufficient).
- Ability to craft and send malicious requests to the vulnerable process.

**Additional Notes:**
- Only Veeam Backup & Replication installations with an SCVMM server registered are vulnerable.
- The default Veeam Backup & Replication installation is NOT vulnerable to this issue.
- Patches are available for versions 11a and 10a.
- New deployments of Veeam Backup & Replication versions 11 and 10 installed using the ISO images dated 20220302 or later are not vulnerable.
