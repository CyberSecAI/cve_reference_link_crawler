Prior to 3385, the user-controlled role parameter enters the application in the Kubernetes::RoleVerificationsController. The role parameter flows into the RoleConfigFile initializer and then into the Kubernetes::Util.parse_file method where it is unsafely deserialized using the YAML.load_stream method. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is fixed in 3385.
