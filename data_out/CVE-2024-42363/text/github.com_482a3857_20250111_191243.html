### @anthonywoo **[anthonywoo](/anthonywoo)** commented [Aug 4, 2023](#issue-1837035091)

**Note**: Samson is a public repo, do not include Zendesk-internal information, urls, etc.

Using [YAML.load\_stream](https://github.com/zendesk/samson/blob/107efb4a252425966aac5e77d0c3670f9b5d7229/plugins/kubernetes/app/models/kubernetes/util.rb#L9) is unsafe and allows instantiating arbitrary classes which may lead to remote code execution (RCE)

I had to use multiple streams because Samson needs to support multiple documents in a single yaml file

### References

* Jira link:

### Risks

* Medium? Some k8 deploys may fail if it is using a disallowed class

Sorry, something went wrong.

wrapping this into a `yaml_safe_load_stream` method would be nice + a test that makes sure it actually does not load unsafe
