- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Excessive verbosity in a debug log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to sensitive data (including credentials) being written to a debug log file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can obtain log files containing sensitive data, potentially including credentials that can be used to access the API of the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility application. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected system running the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
