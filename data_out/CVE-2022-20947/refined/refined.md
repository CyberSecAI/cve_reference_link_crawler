Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, along with the relevant details:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-20947
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in dynamic access policies (DAP) functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper processing of HostScan data received from the Posture (HostScan) module.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation or handling of data, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service. The device reloads (crashes), interrupting its functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote network attack. An attacker can send specially crafted HostScan data over the network to the vulnerable device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
    *   No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when remote access SSL VPN is enabled, HostScan is enabled, and at least one custom DAP is configured on Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software.
*   The attacker crafts malicious HostScan data that triggers a reload on the affected device.
*   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of public exploitation of this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software (specific vulnerable versions are listed in the included CSAF document)
*   Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software (specific vulnerable versions are listed in the included CSAF document)
*   Specific configurations involving remote access SSL VPN, HostScan, and custom DAPs.

**Unaffected Products:**

*   Cisco Firepower Management (FMC) Software is confirmed to be unaffected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   There are no workarounds that fully address this vulnerability.
*   Administrators can disable HostScan to mitigate the risk, but this would affect the functionality.
*   Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability (see the "Fixed Software" section).
*   The Cisco Software Checker tool can help users identify vulnerabilities in their software versions.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   The provided material includes a CSAF document, which provides a machine-readable description of the vulnerability and affected products.
*   Cisco's Security Vulnerability Policy is referenced, which details how Cisco manages and discloses security vulnerabilities.
*   The CVSS v3.1 vector provided is: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`. This translates to a high-severity vulnerability that is exploitable over the network without requiring authentication or user interaction, leading to a complete loss of availability.

The vulnerability arises from the way that Cisco ASA and FTD devices handle HostScan data during remote access SSL VPN sessions, specifically when a custom DAP is configured, creating a potential avenue for denial-of-service.
