{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Froala Editor handles the 'Insert link' parameter when inserting an image. It doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for the injection of malicious code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, stealing of sensitive information, or defacement of the web page.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves inserting a malicious payload into the 'Insert Link' field when using the 'Insert Image' function of the Froala Editor. Specifically, the attacker injects a JavaScript payload within the link URL, which gets executed when a user interacts with the linked image.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to use the Froala Editor and have the ability to insert images and specify links for those images. They must be able to input a malicious payload as a link. The user interface of the Froala Editor must be accessible to the attacker."
