Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-41935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the LiveTable feature in XWiki not properly filtering results based on user view permissions. Specifically, when a user without view access queries the `LiveTableResults` macro, the system returns metadata indicating a matching document exists, even though the user cannot view it. This behavior is present when the query uses filters for document title, location and content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The LiveTable results reveal the existence of documents and their partial content (title, content, XObject properties) to unauthorized users through metadata in responses. Even though the content is obfuscated, the information is sufficient to allow discovery of content through iterative queries.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The LiveTable feature does not properly enforce view permissions when returning the total number of matching rows, and when obfuscated rows are returned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can use iterative queries to reconstruct document titles, content, and object properties even if they lack view permissions. This allows attackers to access restricted information.
- **Reconnaissance:** The vulnerability enables attackers to discover the existence of documents and their metadata without proper authorization, which is useful for targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to the `/bin/get/XWiki/LiveTableResults` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is necessary.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge about the target XWiki instance and access to its network.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, including constructing the query parameters for the `LiveTableResults` macro.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker sends a request to `/bin/get/XWiki/LiveTableResults` with parameters including `outputSyntax=plain`, `collist`, and filter conditions (e.g., `doc.title`, `doc.location`, `doc.content`).
- The system responds with a JSON structure, that contains `totalrows` and `returnedrows`, and a list of `rows`. When the user does not have view rights for a matching document, `doc_viewable` is set to `false` and `doc_fullName` is obfuscated. However, the fact that the `totalrows` is greater than 0 reveals that the requested content exists.
- By iteratively adjusting the filter conditions, an attacker can use binary search to deduce the exact content of fields.
- The `limit` parameter can be set to `0` to return all matching rows.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in XWiki versions 12.10.11, 13.9-rc-1, 13.4.4 and fixed in versions 14.6-rc-1, 13.10.8, and 14.4.3
- The fix involves modifying the `LiveTableResultsMacros.xml` to properly remove obfuscated entries.
- The vulnerability is labeled with "attack\_dataleak", "attacker\_view", and "security".
- The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.3.
