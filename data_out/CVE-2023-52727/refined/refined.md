The provided content relates to CVE-2023-52727.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is unchecked array index access in two functions of the `onos-lib-go` library's ASN1 APER decoding and encoding implementation. Specifically:
  - The `parseAlignBits` function in `aper.go`
  - The `putBitString` function in `marshal.go`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Index Out-of-Range:**  The `parseAlignBits` function attempts to access a slice using an index that can be out of bounds. Similarly, `putBitString` attempts to access an index that is out of range.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:**  The unchecked access can lead to a runtime panic, causing the application (specifically, the E2T, which uses this library) to crash. This can result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted ASN1 APER encoded messages to the vulnerable component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted ASN1 APER message to a service that uses the vulnerable `onos-lib-go` library for decoding or encoding.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was found in version `0.10.24`, and the reporter indicates that it still exists in the latest version.
- Detailed logs and stack traces for both the decoding (parseAlignBits) and encoding (putBitString) vulnerabilities are included in the report.
