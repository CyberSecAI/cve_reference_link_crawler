Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a session fixation issue in the Apache Airflow web interface. When a user's password was reset by an administrator, the existing session remained active, allowing the user to continue accessing the web server until the session expired. This occurred because there was no mechanism to invalidate user sessions upon password reset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Session Fixation:** The core issue is that user sessions were not invalidated after a password reset.
- **Lack of Forced Logout:** There was no built-in mechanism to force-logout users after a password reset, short of manually clearing the session database or changing the secure key and restarting the webserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially maintain access to an account even after the password has been reset. This allows them to continue unauthorized activity until the session expires.
- In the case of the `securecookie` session backend, password reset does not invalidate the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the web interface of Apache Airflow.
- An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to an account before the password reset could maintain their access via the existing session.
- An administrator resetting a password of a user would not immediately invalidate the existing sessions, which allows an attacker to use a previously valid session until it expires.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have gained prior access to an account and have an active session before the user password reset takes place.
- An attacker doesn't need any specific access or roles, any valid user session is exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix implemented invalidates database session backend user sessions upon password reset.
- The fix implemented does not invalidate `securecookie` session backend user sessions upon password reset. Instead, a warning message is displayed to the administrator performing the password reset.
- The fix also includes protection against large session databases, where scanning to remove user sessions could be inefficient.
- Users are advised to upgrade to Apache Airflow 2.7.0 or later to mitigate this issue.
