Subject: CVE-2023-40273: Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interface

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.7.0

Description:

The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for database session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).

With this fix implemented, when using the database session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.

Users of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.

When user's password is reset, we also remove all DB sessions for that user.

Nit, IMHO I think we should not cleanup the session table on each reset password, but if the others are ok with that, I would be ok too

`[Remove user sessions when resetting password](/apache/airflow/pull/33347/commits/10c5e4ebb2205fa8a7800552c74698917f83c740 "Remove user sessions when resetting password

When user's password is reset, we also remove all DB sessions
for that user - for database session backend.

In case we are using securecookie mechanism, resetting password does
not invalidate old sessions, so instead we are displaying warning to
the user performing the reset that in order to clear existing
sessions of the user, the secure_key needs to be changed and it
will invalidate all sessions for all users.

Protection has been added in case the number of sessions in the DB
is too big to effectively scan and remove sessions for the user. In
such case we print warning for the user that sessions have not
been reset, and we suggest to improve the way their deployment
mechanisms create too many sessions - by either changing the way
how automation of the API calls is done and/or by purging the

```
When user's password is reset, we also remove all DB sessions
for that user - for database session backend.

In case we are using securecookie mechanism, resetting password does
not invalidate old sessions, so instead we are displaying warning to
the user performing the reset that in order to clear existing
sessions of the user, the secure_key needs to be changed and it
will invalidate all sessions for all users.

Protection has been added in case the number of sessions in the DB
is too big to effectively scan and remove sessions for the user. In
such case we print warning for the user that sessions have not
been reset, and we suggest to improve the way their deployment
mechanisms create too many sessions - by either changing the way
how automation of the API calls is done and/or by purging the
sessions regularly by "airflow db clean".

`[Remove user sessions when resetting password (](/apache/airflow/commit/f5d8201ea7935d17cecaf25fc90d4ef0ccdd627b "Remove user sessions when resetting password (#33347)

* Remove user sessions when resetting password

When user's password is reset, we also remove all DB sessions
for that user - for database session backend.

In case we are using securecookie mechanism, resetting password does
not invalidate old sessions, so instead we are displaying warning to
the user performing the reset that in order to clear existing
sessions of the user, the secure_key needs to be changed and it
will invalidate all sessions for all users.

Protection has been added in case the number of sessions in the DB
is too big to effectively scan and remove sessions for the user. In
such case we print warning for the user that sessions have not
been reset, and we suggest to improve the way their deployment
mechanisms create too many sessions - by either changing the way
how automation of the API calls is done and/or by purging the
sessions regularly by \"airflow db clean\".

* Update airflow/auth/managers/fab/security_manager/override.py
