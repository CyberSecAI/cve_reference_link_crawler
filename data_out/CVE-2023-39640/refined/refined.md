- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The module's `Hook::getHookModuleExecList()` method within an override makes SQL calls that are vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of module IDs when building SQL queries using `implode` on module lists, allowing attackers to inject SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-89) due to lack of input sanitization. The module uses `implode` to construct SQL queries directly from an array of module IDs without proper casting to integers.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access
    - Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
    - Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock adminsâ€™s ajax scripts
    - Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack using HTTP requests to the front controller. The module controller path can be concealed during the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
