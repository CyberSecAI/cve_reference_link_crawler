Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the storage of Dashlane and KeePass server passwords in plain text within the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the failure to encrypt or hash sensitive password data before storing it in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker gaining access to the database can retrieve the unencrypted Dashlane and KeePass server passwords.
- **Lateral Movement/Account Compromise:** Exposed passwords could be used for further attacks, such as accessing other systems or accounts linked to the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker would need unauthorized access to the database where the unencrypted passwords are stored. This could be through various means such as SQL injection, a compromised user with database access, or a breach of the server itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker must be able to access the database. This could be an internal actor with existing access or an external actor who has compromised the database or server.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker would need to know how to access and query the database.
