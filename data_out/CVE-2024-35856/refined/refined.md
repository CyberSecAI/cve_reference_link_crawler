The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35856.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double free of the `sk_buff` (skb) data structure in the `btmtk_process_coredump` function within the MediaTek Bluetooth driver (`btmtk.c`). The `hci_devcd_append()` function frees the skb on error, but the caller in `btmtk_process_coredump` would also attempt to free the same `skb`, leading to a double free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free vulnerability in the `btmtk_process_coredump` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A double free can lead to memory corruption and potentially cause a system crash. In some circumstances, it could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the device coredump process within the MediaTek Bluetooth driver, when `hci_devcd_init` fails.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to trigger a coredump operation in a system using a vulnerable MediaTek Bluetooth device.
