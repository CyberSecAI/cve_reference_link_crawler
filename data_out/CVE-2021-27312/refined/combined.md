| [https://gleezcms.org/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com](https://gleezcms.org/http%3A//www.google.com) [https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A%2F%2F127%2E0%2E0%2E1%3A9000%2F%5Ftest](https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A//127.0.0.1%3A9000/_test)  if `://` is in the path of url, gleezcms will use curl library to send request.  This vulnerability is far more dangerous than it looks like because curl supports gopher protocol, which is always used to attack php-fpm, redis, memecached and so on. If these application exists, this ssrf may cause remote code execution.  It seems that this vulnerability is caused by different version of kohana farmwork.  In `classes/Kohana/Request.php` of kohana core 3.2, it checks `Request::$initial` first, which prevents the default `index.php` from being able to proxy external pages.  <https://github.com/kohana/core/blob/3.2/master/classes/kohana/request.php#L801>  But in kohana core 3.3, it deletes the check of `Request::$initial` but uses `$allow_external` to prevents the default `index.php` from being able to proxy external pages.`$alow_external` is set to `FALSE` in `index.php`.  <https://github.com/kohana/core/blob/3.3/master/classes/Kohana/Request.php#L678> <https://github.com/kohana/kohana/blob/3.3/master/index.php#L117>  The problem is gleezcms's `index.php` is similar with kohana 3.2, but the `modules/gleez/classes/request.php` is based on kohana 3.3 after [d68b9c9](https://github.com/gleez/cms/commit/d68b9c9d51e70f3a69bf578360792a911be1f3d3), which means `$allow_external` is `TRUE` and `index.php` can be used to proxy external pages. |

[**CVE-2021-27312.md**](#file-cve-2021-27312-md)

A SSRF vulnerability in [gleezcms](https://github.com/gleez/cms) 1.20.

If `://` is present in the URL path, GleezCMS will use the cURL library to send a request specified by the attacker.

POC:

```
https://gleezcms.org/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A%2F%2F127%2E0%2E0%2E1%3A9000%2F%5Ftest

```

This vulnerability is far more dangerous than it looks like because curl supports gopher protocol, which is always used to attack php-fpm, redis, memecached and so on. If these application exists, this ssrf may cause remote code execution.

* In <https://github.com/gleez/cms/blob/222a29a3de705ed912492c074447b72c4dd955ff/index.php#L140>, `Request::factory` is called.

```
echo Request::factory()
		->execute()
		->send_headers()
		->body();
```

* In <https://github.com/gleez/cms/blob/222a29a3de705ed912492c074447b72c4dd955ff/modules/gleez/classes/request.php#L197C73-L197C87>, `$allow_external` parameter is set to `TRUE` by default. This enables support for external proxies in the `Request::__construct`.

```
public static function factory($uri = TRUE, $client_params = array(), $allow_external = TRUE, $injected_routes = array())
{
//......
Request::$initial = $request = new Request($uri, $client_params, $allow_external, $injected_routes);//
//......
}
```

```
public function __construct($uri, $client_params = array(), $allow_external = TRUE, $injected_routes = array())
{
	// Initialise the header
	$this->_header = new HTTP_Header(array());

	// Assign injected routes
	$this->_routes = $injected_routes;

	// Cleanse query parameters from URI (faster that parse_url())
	$split_uri = explode('?', $uri);
	$uri = array_shift($split_uri);

	// Initial request has global $_GET already applied
	if (Request::$initial !== NULL)
	{
		if ($split_uri)
		{
			parse_str($split_uri[0], $this->_get);
		}
	}

	// Detect protocol (if present)
	// $allow_external = FALSE prevents the default index.php from
	// being able to proxy external pages.
	if ( ! $allow_external OR strpos($uri, '://') === FALSE)
	{
		// Remove trailing slashes from the URI
		$this->_uri = trim($uri, '/');

		// Apply the client
		$this->_client = new Request_Client_Internal($client_params);
	}
	else
	{
		// Create a route
		$this->_route = new Route($uri);

		// Store the URI
		$this->_uri = $uri;

		// Set the security setting if required
		if (strpos($uri, 'https://') === 0)
		{
			$this->secure(TRUE);
		}

		// Set external state
		$this->_external = TRUE;

		// Setup the client
		$this->_client = Request_Client_External::factory($client_params);
	}
}
```

* Eventually, the specified URL is accessed in `Kohana_Request_Client_Curl::_send_message`.
