Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-27312

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how GleezCMS handles URLs within its request processing. Specifically, if a URL passed to the application contains `://` in its path, the application uses the cURL library to make a request to that URL. This happens because the `$allow_external` parameter is set to `TRUE` by default in the `Request::__construct`, which then triggers external request handling when the URL contains `://`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. The application allows an attacker to control the URL to which the server makes a request.
*   **Unrestricted URL scheme:** The application's use of cURL means it is susceptible to other protocols besides HTTP/HTTPS, such as `gopher`. This lack of filtering or restriction of URL schemes expands the attack surface, making the application susceptible to more dangerous attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most severe impact is potential remote code execution. Because the cURL library supports the `gopher` protocol, attackers can target internal services like php-fpm, redis, or memcached. If these services are vulnerable, the attacker could achieve RCE. This is because the `gopher` protocol can be used to send commands to these services, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the URL passed to the application to include the `://` string and desired URL they wish to target
*  **Gopher protocol:** Leveraging the `gopher` protocol within the crafted URL, an attacker can target internal services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the GleezCMS application to trigger the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Knowledge of internal network:**  To exploit the RCE potential using the `gopher` protocol, the attacker needs to know about the existence of potentially vulnerable services (like php-fpm, redis, or memcached) running on the internal network, accessible from the GleezCMS server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The issue arises due to a difference in how Kohana framework versions handle external requests.
    *   Kohana 3.2 checks `Request::$initial` to prevent proxying external pages by default.
    *   Kohana 3.3 uses `$allow_external` for the same purpose, with the variable set to `FALSE` by default.
*   GleezCMS uses an `index.php` similar to Kohana 3.2, but its `modules/gleez/classes/request.php` is based on Kohana 3.3. The crucial change is that in GleezCMS the `$allow_external` is `TRUE` by default which removes the protection present in Kohana 3.3 and allows external proxying by default.
*   When an external URL with `://` is detected, the application uses `Kohana_Request_Client_Curl::_send_message` to make the request.

**Proof of Concept:**

The provided content includes these URLs as proof of concept:

```
https://gleezcms.org/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A%2F%2F127%2E0%2E0%2E1%3A9000%2F%5Ftest
```

The vulnerability allows the attacker to make the server connect to arbitrary URLs of their choosing, including internal services using gopher protocol.
