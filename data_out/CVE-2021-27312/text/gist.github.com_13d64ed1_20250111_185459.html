[**CVE-2021-27312.md**](#file-cve-2021-27312-md)

A SSRF vulnerability in [gleezcms](https://github.com/gleez/cms) 1.20.

If `://` is present in the URL path, GleezCMS will use the cURL library to send a request specified by the attacker.

POC:

```
https://gleezcms.org/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A%2F%2F127%2E0%2E0%2E1%3A9000%2F%5Ftest

```

This vulnerability is far more dangerous than it looks like because curl supports gopher protocol, which is always used to attack php-fpm, redis, memecached and so on. If these application exists, this ssrf may cause remote code execution.

* In <https://github.com/gleez/cms/blob/222a29a3de705ed912492c074447b72c4dd955ff/index.php#L140>, `Request::factory` is called.

```
echo Request::factory()
		->execute()
		->send_headers()
		->body();
```

* In <https://github.com/gleez/cms/blob/222a29a3de705ed912492c074447b72c4dd955ff/modules/gleez/classes/request.php#L197C73-L197C87>, `$allow_external` parameter is set to `TRUE` by default. This enables support for external proxies in the `Request::__construct`.

```
public static function factory($uri = TRUE, $client_params = array(), $allow_external = TRUE, $injected_routes = array())
{
//......
Request::$initial = $request = new Request($uri, $client_params, $allow_external, $injected_routes);//
//......
}
```

```
public function __construct($uri, $client_params = array(), $allow_external = TRUE, $injected_routes = array())
{
	// Initialise the header
	$this->_header = new HTTP_Header(array());

	// Assign injected routes
	$this->_routes = $injected_routes;

	// Cleanse query parameters from URI (faster that parse_url())
	$split_uri = explode('?', $uri);
	$uri = array_shift($split_uri);

	// Initial request has global $_GET already applied
	if (Request::$initial !== NULL)
	{
		if ($split_uri)
		{
			parse_str($split_uri[0], $this->_get);
		}
	}

	// Detect protocol (if present)
	// $allow_external = FALSE prevents the default index.php from
	// being able to proxy external pages.
	if ( ! $allow_external OR strpos($uri, '://') === FALSE)
	{
		// Remove trailing slashes from the URI
		$this->_uri = trim($uri, '/');

		// Apply the client
		$this->_client = new Request_Client_Internal($client_params);
	}
	else
	{
		// Create a route
		$this->_route = new Route($uri);

		// Store the URI
		$this->_uri = $uri;

		// Set the security setting if required
		if (strpos($uri, 'https://') === 0)
		{
			$this->secure(TRUE);
		}

		// Set external state
		$this->_external = TRUE;

		// Setup the client
		$this->_client = Request_Client_External::factory($client_params);
	}
}
```

* Eventually, the specified URL is accessed in `Kohana_Request_Client_Curl::_send_message`.
