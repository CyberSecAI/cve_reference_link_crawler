| [https://gleezcms.org/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com](https://gleezcms.org/http%3A//www.google.com) [https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A%2F%2F127%2E0%2E0%2E1%3A9000%2F%5Ftest](https://gleezcms.org/gopher%3A//127.0.0.1%3A9000/_test)  if `://` is in the path of url, gleezcms will use curl library to send request.  This vulnerability is far more dangerous than it looks like because curl supports gopher protocol, which is always used to attack php-fpm, redis, memecached and so on. If these application exists, this ssrf may cause remote code execution.  It seems that this vulnerability is caused by different version of kohana farmwork.  In `classes/Kohana/Request.php` of kohana core 3.2, it checks `Request::$initial` first, which prevents the default `index.php` from being able to proxy external pages.  <https://github.com/kohana/core/blob/3.2/master/classes/kohana/request.php#L801>  But in kohana core 3.3, it deletes the check of `Request::$initial` but uses `$allow_external` to prevents the default `index.php` from being able to proxy external pages.`$alow_external` is set to `FALSE` in `index.php`.  <https://github.com/kohana/core/blob/3.3/master/classes/Kohana/Request.php#L678> <https://github.com/kohana/kohana/blob/3.3/master/index.php#L117>  The problem is gleezcms's `index.php` is similar with kohana 3.2, but the `modules/gleez/classes/request.php` is based on kohana 3.3 after [d68b9c9](https://github.com/gleez/cms/commit/d68b9c9d51e70f3a69bf578360792a911be1f3d3), which means `$allow_external` is `TRUE` and `index.php` can be used to proxy external pages. |
