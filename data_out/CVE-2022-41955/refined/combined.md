High

[damianhxy](/damianhxy)
published
GHSA-x5r3-vf3p-3269
Jan 13, 2023

## Package

Autolab

## Affected versions

>= 2.0.1, <= 2.9.0

## Patched versions

2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's MOSS functionality, whereby an instructor with access to the feature might be able to execute code on the server hosting Autolab.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in v2.10.0.

### Workarounds

Disable the MOSS feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `run_moss` in `app/controllers/courses_controller.rb` with `render(plain: "Feature disabled", status: :bad_request) && return`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# GHSL-2022-100: Path traversal vulnerability and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Autolab - CVE-2022-41955,CVE-2022-41956

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2022-11-21: Notified Autolab maintainers via email.
* 2022-11-21: Received initial acknowledgments by the Autolab team.
* 2022-11-21: The Autolab team started working on the fixes.
* 2022-01-13: Vulnerabilities were fixed and advisories were published [1](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-g7x7-mgrv-f24x), [2](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-x5r3-vf3p-3269).

## Summary

Two vulnerabilities were found in Autolab:

* Issue 1: File disclosure due to path traversal (`GHSL-2022-100`) - A path traversal vulnerability exists in Autolab’s remote handin feature.
* Issue 2: Authenticated Remote Code Execution (`GHSL-2022-124`) - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the plagiarism checker functionality of Autolab.

These issues are listed in detail below.

## Product

Autolab

## Tested Version

[v2.9.0](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

## Details

### Issue 1: File disclosure due to path traversal (`GHSL-2022-100`)

Autolab provides the possibility to allow submissions of students via a so-called remote handin feature. Handins submitted with this feature are copied from a path that is accessible to the running Autolab instance. In practice the remote handin path will probably be located in a directory of a shared drive. The endpoint for such submissions allows unauthenticated attackers to hand-in assignments for registered users using paths outside of their submission directory. The value of the [`submit`](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/524d4bb896e6d47e469e621b5d44c8cc36b90cd2/app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb#L131) parameter is passed to the [`saveHandin`](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/524d4bb896e6d47e469e621b5d44c8cc36b90cd2/app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb#L145) module method without futher sanitization or verification. The contents of the corresponding files of the submitted file paths could then be viewed by users viewing “their” submissions.

#### Proof of Concept

Preconditions:

1. Remote handin path needs to be set
2. Handin directory inside remote handin path for a user must exist in the form: `<email>_remote_handin_<assessment-name>` (This seems to be a general precondition for making the remote handin feature work)
3. At least one email address of a user that is registered to any course and assigment

The attacker then simply needs to construct an URL in this form and call it via GET request:

```
http://<autolab-host>/courses/<course-name>/assessments/<assessment-name>/local_submit?user=<registered-user-email>&submit=../../../../../<path-to-existing-file>

```

E.g.:

```
http://127.0.0.1/courses/Mycourse/assessments/mylab/local_submit?user=student@host.test&submit=../../../../../etc/passwd

```

Afterwards the attacker can view or download the contents of the desired file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) in the “Handin History” of the assessment.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure`.

### Issue 2: Authenticated Remote Code Execution (`GHSL-2022-124`)

Autolab provides the functionality to check submissions for plagiarism using [MOSS (Measure Of Software Similarity)](https://docs.autolabproject.com/features/moss/). The Moss Cheat Checker can be run by instructors with sufficient permissions. The parameters [`max_lines`](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L397) and [`language_selection`](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L399) both flow unsanitized through several ([1](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L402), [2](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L403), [3](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L414)) different join operations before flowing into a [command execution sink](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/9da0c435346d638bfc7d08dce7d42403cac5c7c5/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb#L415). Using this vulnerability an attacker might gain control over the server running Autolab.

This vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL’s [Uncontrolled command line](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ruby/rb-command-line-injection/) query.

#### Proof of Concept

Preconditions:

1. Attacker needs to be logged in as instructor
2. There needs to be an existing course where the instructor has access permissions

This vulnerability can simply be exploited by using a browser and navigating to:

```
http://<autolab-host>/courses/<course-name>/moss

```

After selecting an assignment, the checkbox “Max Lines” needs to be enabled and instead of providing a valid number of lines a shell command such as `| touch /tmp/pwned.txt |` can be provided. (Which will then create the file `/tmp/pwned.txt` after clicking “GO!”).

To manipulate the `language_selection` parameter in the same way a browser inspection tools or a tool like `curl` can be used to manufacture the desired requests.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
