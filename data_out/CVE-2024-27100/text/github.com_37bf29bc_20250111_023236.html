SECURITY: Prevent large staff actions causing DoS

```
This commit operates at three levels of abstraction:

 1. We want to prevent user history rows from being unbounded in size.
    This commit adds rails validations to limit the sizes of columns on
    user_histories,

 2. However, we don't want to prevent certain actions from being
    completed if these columns are too long. In those cases, we truncate
    the values that are given and store the truncated versions,

 3. For endpoints that perform staff actions, we can further control
    what is permitted by explicitly validating the params that are given
    before attempting the action,
```
