Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied file names during file upload and delete operations in the `/api/deploy/upload` and `/api/database/upload` endpoints. The application directly uses the original filename provided by the user without any validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. Attackers can use `../` sequences in filenames to navigate outside the intended upload directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Due to the path traversal vulnerability, attackers can upload files to any location on the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  Attackers can also delete arbitrary files on the server by specifying their paths using `../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can upload malicious files, such as dynamic link libraries (DLLs) or scripts, to gain remote code execution. They could also manipulate scheduled tasks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting arbitrary files, including critical system files, attackers can disrupt the stable operation of the web service.
*   **Data Manipulation/Loss:** Attackers can overwrite sensitive files or delete important data leading to data manipulation or loss.
*   **System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the HTTP POST requests to the `/api/deploy/upload` and `/api/database/upload` endpoints.
*   Attackers can manipulate the `filename` parameter in the multipart file upload request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to craft malicious filenames with path traversal sequences such as `../`.
*   The attacker would also require authorization to access the vulnerable endpoints as indicated by the `@PreAuthorize` annotations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in eladmin version v2.7 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `DatabaseController.java` and `DeployController.java` files within the eladmin-system module.
*   The code snippets provided highlight the vulnerability, particularly the usage of `file.getOriginalFilename()` without any sanitization and using it to construct the file path `fileSavePath+fileName`.
*  The issue report includes proof-of-concept (POC) screenshots demonstrating both arbitrary file upload and deletion.
