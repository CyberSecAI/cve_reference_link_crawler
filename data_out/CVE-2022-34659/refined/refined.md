- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simcenter STAR-CCM+ software, when using the Power-on-Demand public license server, exposes sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. The software transmits user, host, and display names to the public license server, which can be accessed by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the user, host, and display names of systems using the software.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the public license server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or access the information transmitted to the public license server. No authentication is required.
