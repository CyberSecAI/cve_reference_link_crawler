SUMMARY

Simcenter STAR-CCM+ contains an information disclosure vulnerability when using the Power-on-Demand
public license server. An attacker could access a system’s host, user, and display name.

Siemens is preparing updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates
are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

Simcenter STAR-CCM+:
All versions only if the Power-on-Demand public
license server is used

Currently no ﬁx is available
See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Set the environmental variable STARLICENSEHIDE to 1. This will send the string “unknown” for
the user, host and display name instead of the real values. The setting is supported since version
V8.04 (June 2013) of Simcenter STAR-CCM+

• Avoid using sensitive or personal data in user, host and display names

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Simcenter STAR-CCM+ is a multiphysics computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) software for the simulation
of products operating under real-world conditions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-34659

Affected applications expose user, host and display name of users, when the public license server is
used. This could allow an attacker to retrieve this information.
