## Vulnerability in Local Security Authority Subsystem Service Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (983539)

Published: September 14, 2010

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Active Directory, Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM), and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (AD LDS). The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an authenticated attacker sent specially crafted Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) messages to a listening LSASS server. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a member account within the target Windows domain. However, the attacker does not need to have a workstation joined to the Windows domain.

This security update is rated Important for Active Directory, ADAM, and AD LDS when installed on supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) handles certain LDAP messages. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

## LSASS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0820

An authenticated elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows due to the way that the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) improperly handles certain Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) messages. The vulnerability exists in implementations of Active Directory, Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM), and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service (AD LDS). An attacker must have previously authenticated with the LSASS server prior to exploiting this issue. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0820](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0820).

#### Mitigating Factors for LSASS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0820

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be a member account within the target Windows domain. However, the attacker does not need to have a workstation joined to the Windows domain.

#### Workarounds for LSASS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0820

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP port 389 at the firewall**

  Block TCP port 389 at the firewall. This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component.

  Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). For more information about the Windows Firewall, see [How to Configure Windows Firewall on a Single Computer](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/smallbusiness/prodtech/windowsxp/cfgfwall.mspx).

#### FAQ for LSASS Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0820

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows LSASS implementation does not properly handle specific malformed packets in LDAP messages.

**What is LSASS?**

The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) provides an interface for managing local security, domain authentication, and Active Directory service processes. LSASS handles authentication for the client and for the server. LSASS also contains features for supporting Active Directory utilities.

**What is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)?**

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a directory service protocol that runs directly over the TCP/IP stack. The information model (for both data and namespaces) of LDAP is similar to that of the X.500 OSI directory service, but with fewer features and lower resource requirements than X.500. Unlike most other Internet protocols, LDAP has an associated API that simplifies writing Internet directory service applications. The LDAP API is applicable to directory management and browser applications that do not have directory service support as their primary function. LDAP cannot create directories or specify how a directory service operates.

**What is Active Directory Lightweight Directory Service?**

Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) is an independent mode of Active Directory that provides dedicated directory services for applications. AD LDS is available for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. AD LDS replaces Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM), which is available for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

**How can I confirm whether my server is running the LDAP service if I am using Active Directory?**

To confirm whether a server is listening to LDAP or LDAPS queries, run the following command from an administrator command prompt and look to see if the system is listening on the LDAP port (389) or the LDAPS port (636), or either of the Global Catalog service ports (3268 or 3269):

netstat -a

LDAP is enabled if the results contain any of the following:

Proto Local Address Foreign Address State

TCP 0.0.0.0:389 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING

TCP 0.0.0.0:636 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING

TCP 0.0.0.0:3268 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING

TCP 0.0.0.0:3269 0.0.0.0:0 LISTENING

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability will cause an affected system to stop responding and restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted LDAP messages to a listening LSASS server. An attacker must have previously authenticated with the LSASS server prior to exploiting this issue.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All systems running an affected operating system with Active Directory services installed are affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability does not directly affect client-only systems.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which LSASS handles certain LDAP messages.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
