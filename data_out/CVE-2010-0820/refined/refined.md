- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) improperly handles certain Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) messages, leading to a heap overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by malformed packets within LDAP messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow vulnerability in LSASS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted LDAP messages to a listening LSASS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with the LSASS server prior to exploiting the vulnerability and have a member account within the target Windows domain. They do not, however, need a workstation joined to the Windows domain.
