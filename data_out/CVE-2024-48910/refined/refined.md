The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48910.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in DOMPurify.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or code execution.
- The vulnerability is located in the `clone` function within `src/utils.js` where it iterates through the properties of an object and copies them. The code was vulnerable to prototype pollution via the hasOwnProperty check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to a bypass of DOMPurify's sanitization, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker can control the input that is processed by the library.
- In the specific test case added to address this vulnerability, arbitrary attributes could be injected into HTML tags even if they were not explicitly allowed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely.
- The attacker needs to supply crafted input to the DOMPurify library, which will then modify the prototype chain.
- The attacker can modify the prototype of the object that is being cloned, leading to unexpected behavior when DOMPurify uses this object to configure itself.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is processed by the DOMPurify library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.2 by modifying the `clone` function within `src/utils.js` to explicitly check `hasOwnProperty` with call to avoid prototype pollution.
- The commit `d1dd037` on Github includes the fix for this vulnerability, and adds a test case to ensure that the fix is effective. The test case demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability via `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype` to inject arbitrary attributes in tags.
