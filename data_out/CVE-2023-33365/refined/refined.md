**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in Suprema BioStar 2 software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The software does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when accessing files, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Fetch: An attacker can use the path traversal vulnerability to access and fetch any file on the web server's file system. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files, user data, or even system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated HTTP requests: The vulnerability can be exploited through unauthenticated HTTP requests. This means an attacker doesn't need to have valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable BioStar 2 software. No authentication is required for the exploit, so the attacker does not need to have a valid account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found to exist in Suprema BioStar 2 versions prior to 2.9.1
- The vendor, Suprema, has released a patch in version 2.9.1 to address this vulnerability. The patch notes mention "Improved TA Path Traversal vulnerability" as one of the fixes.
