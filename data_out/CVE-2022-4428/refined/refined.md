{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `support_uri` parameter in the WARP client local settings file (mdm.xml) lacked proper validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation of the `support_uri` parameter.",
     "Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input before use."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation and launching an arbitrary executable on the local machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the local file system could use a crafted XML config file pointing to a malicious file, or set a local path to the executable using Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard (for Zero Trust enrolled clients).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs access to the local file system or ability to control the Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard configuration for enrolled clients."
