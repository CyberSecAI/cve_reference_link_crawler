**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website.
*   These injected scripts are executed when guests visit the site.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, redirecting users to phishing sites, displaying unwanted advertisements, or performing other unauthorized actions within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the WordPress plugin itself.
*   An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into a vulnerable input or output of the plugin.
*   When a user visits the page displaying the injected content, the script executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need specific privileges on the website, as the vulnerability allows script injection that would be triggered for any visitor to the affected page.
*   The attacker would likely need to find a specific entry point or mechanism within the plugin to inject the malicious script.

**Additional Information:**
*   The plugin is considered abandoned, as it has not been updated in over a year.
*   There is no official fix available.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9, which is considered low severity, but it is still a significant security issue as it can affect all visitors to the site.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sharanabasappa.
*   The required privilege to exploit the vulnerability is "administrator," though the impact of the XSS would affect all visitors.
