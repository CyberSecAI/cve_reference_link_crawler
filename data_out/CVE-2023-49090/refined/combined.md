# Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS

Moderate

[mshibuya](/mshibuya)
published
GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj
Nov 29, 2023

## Package

bundler

carrierwave
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.5 and < 2.2.5

## Patched versions

3.0.5, 2.2.5

## Description

### Impact

[CarrierWave::Uploader::ContentTypeAllowlist](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/lib/carrierwave/uploader/content_type_allowlist.rb) has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS.

The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match.

If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed.

In addition, by setting the Content-Type configured by the attacker at the time of file delivery, it is possible to cause XSS on the user's browser when the uploaded file is opened.

### Patches

Upgrade to [3.0.5](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/3.0.5) or [2.2.5](https://rubygems.org/gems/carrierwave/versions/2.2.5).

### Workarounds

When validating with `allowlisted_content_type?` in [CarrierWave::Uploader::ContentTypeAllowlist](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/lib/carrierwave/uploader/content_type_allowlist.rb) , forward match(`\A`) the Content-Type set in `content_type_allowlist`, preventing unintentional permission of `text/html;image/png` when you want to allow only `image/png` in `content_type_allowlist`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
