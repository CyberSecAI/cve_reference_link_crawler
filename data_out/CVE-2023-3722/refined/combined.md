In AWS swonly deployment, with
AADS 8.1.3 OR even after upgrade
to 8.1.4, the custom URL from Utility
server VIP is not accessible

In AWS, Virtual IP master and
Virtual IP backup will not be seen on
AADS admin GUI.

AADS is case sensitive when
looking at trusted host list FQDNs

8.0, 8.0.1

missing the data encryption
instruction when deploying on SDM
integrated with SMGR 8.0.1

8.0.1

Import IDP.xml: Some special chars
incorrect mapping between bluetool
and admin GUI

8.0.1

Dynamic config group search fails if
any LDAP is down in multi-LDAP
setup

7.1.5

Following are the workaround steps:
1. Add "NM_CONTROLLED=no" to
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-
eth0
2. Add "NM_CONTROLLED=no" to
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-
eth1
3. Add "GATEWAYDEV=eth0" to /etc
/sysconfig/network
4. systemctl restart network

Please remove the space at the end
of givenname and reimport the
users from the Bulk import Users
page of AADS Admin UI

Please add Active Users Search
Filter as
(objectClass=inetOrgPerson) for
onboard openldap in the ldap
configuration page of AADS admin
UI and Save the configuration.

This issue would be addressed by a
Service pack and a PSN . Please
take a VM snap shot before
upgrading AADS 8.1.3 FIPS system
to 8.1.3

N/A

N/A

Please check with SDM version 8.1
and onwards to get the complete
display of data encryption
parameters during OVA deployment
using SDM.

Admin to continue using the
keycloak admin UI on browser to
enter any complicated Admin/User
roles.

Need to ensure all the LDAP
managed on AADS are up and do
not return any exceptions while
being searched by the Dynamic
Configuration service.

If case of letters is changed in a
LDAP group name/DN, then the
user should ideally publish the
settings again on the new group
name/DN, so that those settings are
searchable for the new group.

7.1.3.2

Run “app configure” screens and
navigate to the Utility Server sub-
menu. Enter all the relevant info
including the correct enrollment
password. Hit “Apply”.

ACS-7167

Auto Config does not support case-
insensitivity in LDAP Group DNs.

7.1.5

ACS-6380

This means that two groups having
the same name but with different
case (capital or small) in the name,
are treated as different groups in
Auto Config functionalities like
Publishing, searching on group, etc.
For example: If a user publishes
some settings for a LDAP group via
Auto Config, and then changes the
name/DN of the group in LDAP by
changing the case of the letters
only, then the settings published via
Auto Config won't be searchable
with the new group name. The user
would have to search settings with
the old name that was used for
publishing.

Upgrading from a load where the US
was not enabled, or enabled but
without the US VIP/FQDN to a load
where the US has a dedicated VIP
/FQDN. Eg: 7.1.3.1.38 to 7.1.3.2.39
Also, during this upgrade, it prompts
for SMGR enrollment password,
along with capturing other data like
utility server virtual IP and virtual
FQDN.

Problem may arise if the admin
accidentally (or otherwise) enters an
incorrect SMGR enrollment
password.
As a result The Utility Server
certificates may not be fully/correctly
configured, because of which the
phones will not be able to boot up.

ACS-5735

Inclusion the T attribute in the
Subject CN of the CA in SMGR CA ,
causes AADS installation to fail

7.1.3

Modify the CA to remove the T
attribute. All previously generated
certificates using this CA will need to
be regenerated.
