The provided content describes a vulnerability related to TCP hijacking in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of:
    - a side-channel in NAT port preservation strategy.
    - insufficient reverse path validation by Wi-Fi routers.
    - routers disabling TCP window tracking strategy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NAT port preservation vulnerability allows an off-path attacker to infer if a victim client on the network is communicating with a host on the internet via TCP.
- Insufficient reverse path validation enables the injection of fake TCP packets.
- Disabled TCP window tracking allows an attacker to evict the original NAT mapping and reconstruct a new one by sending fake TCP packets. This facilitates the interception of TCP packets from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Interception of TCP packets from the server.
- Obtaining current sequence and acknowledgment numbers.
- Forcibly closing TCP connections.
- Poisoning the traffic in plain text.
- Rerouting the server's incoming packets to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Off-path attacker sends packets to the victim's router.
- Exploits vulnerabilities in NAT port preservation, reverse path validation and TCP window tracking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Off-path attacker on the same network (e.g., connected to the same Wi-Fi network).
- Ability to inject packets to the router.
- Capability to craft TCP packets.
