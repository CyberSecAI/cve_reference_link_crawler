- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer underwrite vulnerability exists in the firmware verification routine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer underwrite (CWE-124)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Specifically crafted firmware image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be located in the adjacent network and be able to provide a crafted firmware image to the vulnerable device. The attacker also needs to have high privileges for exploitation.
