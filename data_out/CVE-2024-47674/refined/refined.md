The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's memory management (mm) subsystem. Specifically, it addresses a flaw in how partial page frame number (PFN) mappings are handled during error conditions in the `remap_pfn_range` function.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The `remap_pfn_range` function, which is used to map physical memory into a user-space virtual address range, does not properly handle errors that may occur during the mapping process. PFN mappings are special because they lack lifetime information and do not use reference counting, unlike normal memory mappings. This makes it easy to cause errors in the cleanup process during a failure.
- If `remap_pfn_range` fails partially, it could potentially leave stale and dangling page table entries (PTEs) after the physical backing store has been freed. This can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities or data corruption, depending on the timing of other memory operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a potential use-after-free. The kernel might free the physical memory associated with a partial PFN mapping, while the page table still has entries pointing to the freed memory.
- **Dangling PTE Entries:**  Partial mappings may leave dangling PTE entries due to not cleaning them up before handling errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation could lead to memory corruption, system instability, or potentially arbitrary code execution through a use-after-free scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  The vulnerability can be triggered through the `mmap()` system call, specifically when mapping physical memory using `remap_pfn_range` or `remap_pfn_range_notrack`.
-  A user-space process with the ability to trigger the conditions that result in a failed mmap operation could cause the partial pfn mapping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-  An attacker needs to be able to call the mmap system call and trigger a partial mapping failure, this can be caused by supplying invalid parameters during the mmap call. 

**Fix:**

- The fix introduces a new internal function `remap_pfn_range_internal` which encapsulates the actual mapping process. The external `remap_pfn_range_notrack` function is changed to call the internal one.
- The fix adds a call to `zap_page_range_single` which removes the partial pfn mapping and prevents dangling PTEs before other error handling is performed, thus preventing use-after-free scenarios.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix explicitly handles the scenario of a failed partial PFN mapping by ensuring that any such mapping is torn down *before* any other error handling.
- The patch also introduces a new internal function to reduce code duplication.
- This is a fix for the incorrect ordering of error handling during mapping failures, and prevents use after free vulnerabilities.
