The provided content is related to CVE-2024-1923.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `delete_class` function within the `ajax-api.php` file of the Simple Student Attendance System. The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$id` from `$_POST`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the direct embedding of the user-provided `id` parameter into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Data Manipulation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data deletion: As demonstrated in the PoC, attackers can delete all data from the `class_tbl` table.
    - Data modification: Attackers could modify existing data in the database.
    - Data exfiltration: Attackers could potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Complete compromise: Depending on the database user's permissions, attackers could potentially gain complete control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `ajax-api.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `delete_class`.
- **Manipulated 'id' parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter of the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability in the provided Proof of Concept as it deletes all data from the table without any form of authentication.
