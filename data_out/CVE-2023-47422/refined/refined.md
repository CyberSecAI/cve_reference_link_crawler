- **Root cause:** The `R7WebsSecurityHandler` function within the `/usr/sbin/httpd` component uses `strstr` to check if a request requires authentication. This function incorrectly allows access to any endpoint if the URL contains a substring of certain allowed file names, leading to an authentication bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control due to the usage of `strstr` for authentication checks instead of a more robust method.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and access any endpoint of the `httpd` service by appending strings like `?img/main-logo.png` or `?reasy-ui-1.0.3.js` to the URL.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP requests with specific URL parameters to the vulnerable `/usr/sbin/httpd` service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tenda device. No special privileges are required besides network access to the device.
