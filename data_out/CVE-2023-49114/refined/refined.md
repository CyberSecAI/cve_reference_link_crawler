Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Qognify VMS Client/Viewer application attempts to load multiple DLL files from the DLL search order. It fails to locate some of these files. This makes the application vulnerable to DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The application's insecure DLL loading process allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name as a missing one in a location where the application searches for DLLs. When the application is launched, the attacker's DLL is loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged attacker can achieve code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. In the provided proof-of-concept (POC), this was used to add a new user to the local administrators group, thus escalating the attacker's privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is DLL hijacking, where the attacker replaces a legitimate DLL with a malicious one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write files to a directory that is part of the DLL search order on the target system. This typically requires write permissions to:
    - The directory where the application executable is located.
    - The system directory.
    - The 16-bit system directory.
    - The Windows directory.
    - The current working directory (CWD).
    - Directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
- The attacker needs a high-privileged user to launch the vulnerable application (`VMS_Client.exe`).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Qognify VMS Client Viewer versions 7.1 and later.
- The vendor has released a hardening guide to mitigate the vulnerability, advising users to ensure that no DLLs can be preloaded.
- The vulnerability was found by Sandro Einfeldt of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
