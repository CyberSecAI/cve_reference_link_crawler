Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-39172:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the "Name" field when creating a new process/ticket ("Vorgang") within the openVIVA c2 application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript is injected into the application's database and executed when other users access the affected data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the process list.
- **Potential for sensitive data access or modification:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Access to sensitive information displayed on the victim's screen
    - Modification of data
    - Further attacks against other users
- **Targeted attacks:** The attacker can specify the victim by assigning the malicious process to them, ensuring the XSS payload is executed on the intended target's browser.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Web application interface:** The attack is performed via the web interface of the openVIVA c2 application.
- **Specifically crafted input:** The attacker crafts a specific input containing a malicious JavaScript payload.
- **Process/ticket creation:** The attack is initiated when creating a new process/ticket ("Vorgang").

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have an account on the openVIVA c2 application with the "user" role.
- **Access to process/ticket creation:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create new processes/tickets.
- **Ability to assign processes to other users:** The attacker needs to assign a process to a victim via the 'Hauptverantwortlicher' field.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists in versions prior to 20220801.
- The application is built on top of Oracle Apex.
- The provided proof of concept describes the exact steps to reproduce the attack by creating a new "Vorgang", inserting the XSS payload into the name field and assigning it to a victim.
- The advisory also mentions that the vendor has no public download link and customers will be patched according to their maintenance contract.
