- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices have an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers on the same network can read arbitrary system files.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers on the same network as the vulnerable device can exploit the path traversal vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
