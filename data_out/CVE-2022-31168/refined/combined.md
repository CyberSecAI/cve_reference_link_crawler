  backups on a system with a different configuration.
* Updated translations, including major updates to the Mongolian and

  Serbian translations.'

# Insufficient authorization check for changing bot roles in Zulip Server

Moderate

[andersk](/andersk)
published
GHSA-c3cp-ggg5-9xw5
Jul 22, 2022

## Package

Zulip Server
(Application)

## Affected versions

< 5.5

## Patched versions

5.5

## Description

### Impact

Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots.

### Patches

The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5.

### Workarounds

Members who don’t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can’t exploit the vulnerability. An organization administrator can restrict the **Who can create bots** permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can discuss them on the [developer community Zulip server](https://zulip.com/developer-community/), or email the Zulip security team.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
