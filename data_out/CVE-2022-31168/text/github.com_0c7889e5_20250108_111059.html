### 5.5 -- 2022-07-21

* CVE-2022-31168: Fix authorization check for changing bot roles. Due

  to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and all prior

  releases, a member of an organization could craft an API call that

  would grant organization administrator privileges to one of their bots.
* Added new options to the `restore-backup` tool to simplify restoring

  backups on a system with a different configuration.
* Updated translations, including major updates to the Mongolian and

  Serbian translations.'
