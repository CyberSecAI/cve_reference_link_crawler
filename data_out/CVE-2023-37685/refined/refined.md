Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the search functionality of the admin report page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page, which is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input validation and sanitization. The application does not remove or encode potentially malicious characters (like `<` and `>`) from the search query before displaying it on the page.
*   **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The vulnerability also stems from insufficient output encoding; the application renders the user's input on the page without escaping or encoding special HTML characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** As the XSS payload demonstrates with `alert(document.domain)`, an attacker can steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other data stored in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session information to hijack user sessions.
*   **Malware Delivery:** XSS could be used to redirect victims to malicious websites or inject malware directly.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker can alter the appearance of the web page or modify the content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely by injecting the malicious payload into the search field.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (typically an admin in this case) to visit the vulnerable page and for the injected script to be rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the vulnerable functionality:** The attacker needs access to the admin panel's search report page.
*   **Ability to inject script:** The attacker must be able to enter the XSS payload into the "searchinput" parameter field.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates that by inserting the payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>` into the search input field of the admin report page at `https://localhost.com/onhs/admin/search-report.php`, the JavaScript will be executed.
The specific vulnerability is in the search input field of the `search-report.php` page within the admin portal.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Online Nurse Hiring System v1.0" from PHPGURUKUL.
*   The content provides links to the vendor's website and specific page where the vulnerable software can be downloaded.
*   It mentions that the admin panel's default credentials are `admin/Test@123` which is a security issue itself.
