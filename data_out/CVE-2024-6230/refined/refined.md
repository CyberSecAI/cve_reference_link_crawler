- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pardakht Delkhah plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when resetting its form fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a missing CSRF check, allowing an attacker to induce an admin to reset the plugin's form fields without the admin's intention.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can reset the customized form fields of the plugin to their default values, leading to a loss of configuration settings for the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. An attacker crafts a malicious link and tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to visit it. The administrator needs to be logged into the WordPress dashboard for the exploit to succeed.
