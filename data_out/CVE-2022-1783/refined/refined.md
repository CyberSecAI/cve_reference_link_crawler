An attacker could abuse the merge request feature to make a victim's browser perform an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain. This is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of URLs in merge requests leading to the ability to make the victim's browser perform HTTP requests to arbitrary domains.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially expose internal services, resources, or potentially leak sensitive information by abusing the merge request feature to make a victim's browser perform an HTTP request to an arbitrary domain.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker leverages the merge request feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify merge requests and requires a victim to interact with the malicious merge request. The user interaction is a crucial part of the attack. The attacker must have low privileges to perform the attack.
