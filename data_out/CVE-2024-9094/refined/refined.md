Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `bloodname` parameter in the `o-.php` file of the "code-projects blood-bank-system-in-php v1.0" is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `bloodname` parameter, which will then be executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
-  An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
-  An attacker could potentially gain control of the database server, depending on the database configuration and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `o-.php` file with malicious SQL code in the `bloodname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application and send HTTP requests to it.
-   No specific privileges are mentioned, so the attacker likely doesn't need any special permissions on the target system other than the ability to send requests to the web application.
