# tqdm CLI arguments injection attack

Low

[casperdcl](/casperdcl)
published
GHSA-g7vv-2v7x-gj9p
May 2, 2024

## Package

pip

tqdm
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 4.4.0

## Patched versions

4.66.3

## Description

### Impact

Any optional non-boolean CLI arguments (e.g. `--delim`, `--buf-size`, `--manpath`) are passed through python's `eval`, allowing arbitrary code execution. Example:

```
python -m tqdm --manpath="\" + str(exec(\"import os\nos.system('echo hi && killall python3')\")) + \""
```
### Patches

[4e613f8](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/commit/4e613f84ed2ae029559f539464df83fa91feb316) released in `tqdm>=4.66.3`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
