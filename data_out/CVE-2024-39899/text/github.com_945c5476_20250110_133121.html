| Only other circumvention idea would be Unicode RTL overwrite characters? <https://unicode-explorer.com/c/202E> I dunno if this confuses the PHP functions though that they read the string from the right? (My gut is, likely it does not, because technically strings start from the left, an Unicode RTL is only for display stuff?) |

### **[elrido](/elrido)** commented [Jul 7, 2024](#issuecomment-2212480492)

| *sigh* Due to [PHP 6 never materializing](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6), PHP still treats strings purely as byte arrays and is oblivious to unicode characters. So yes, as long as the admin doesn't include any utf-8 sequences in the basepath configuration setting, the strpos will remain agnostic to any utf-8 sequences passed in the GET parameter. It would then not match or not at position 0. |

Okay, so unless you want to introduce another test in `tst/JsonApiTest.php` for the issue at hand, this LGTM.
