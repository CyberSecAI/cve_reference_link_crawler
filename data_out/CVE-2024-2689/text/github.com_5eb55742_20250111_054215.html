# Visibility schema changes

`TemporalPauseInfo` column was added to visibility. `TemporalPauseInfo` contains search attribute related to paused entities in temporal workflows.

Before upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.26.2, you must upgrade your visibility schemas to the following:

* Visibility:
  + Elasticsearch schema v8
  + MySQL schema 1.7
  + PostgreSQL schema v1.7

# Batch metrics (wide events)

PR: [#6655](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/6655)

Description: Extended `metrics.Handler` interface with a new `StartBatch` method. StartBatch returns a BatchHandler that can be used to send a sequence of metrics as a single event when Close() is called on the batch. All provided metric handlers have been updated with the new interface and simply send metrics individually.

üí•¬†BREAKING CHANGE üí• If you provide a custom metrics handler with `temporal.WithCustomMetricsHandler(metricsHandler)` you will need to implement `StartBatch()` on that handler. [See the tally metrics handler for an example of this.](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/2eb04bf7176a84aead476fa2564d88a835c75444/common/metrics/tally_metrics_handler.go#L123-L129)

# Versioning / safe deploy (pre-release)

The following EXPERIMENTAL Versioning APIs are added in this release:

* Deployment APIs, for managing worker deployments:
  + `DescribeDeployment`
  + `ListDeployments`
  + `GetCurrentDeployment`
  + `SetCurrentDeployment`
  + `GetDeploymentReachability`
* `UpdateWorkflowExecutionOptions`¬†API (and its batch mode) for setting versioning override for executions.

Documentation is not available at this point. Do not use above APIs in production.

To enable these APIs the following configs should be enabled: `system.enableDeployments` and `frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs`.

# Workflow Update GA

Description:

Workflow Update enables a gRPC client of a Workflow Execution to issue requests to that Workflow Execution and receive a response. These requests are delivered to and processed by a client-specified Workflow Execution. Updates are differentiated from Queries in that the processing of an Update is allowed to modify the state of a Workflow Execution. Updates are different from Signals in that an Update returns a response.

Any gRPC client can invoke Updates via the¬†`WorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowExecution`. Additionally, past Update requests can be observed via the¬†`WorkflowService.PollWorkflowExecutionUpdate`¬†API. The wait stage option determines whether they respond once the Update was¬†*accepted*¬†or¬†*completed*.

Note that an Update only becomes durable when it was¬†*accepted*, until then, it will not appear in the Workflow history. SDKs will automatically retry to ensure Update requests complete.

The execution and retention of Updates is configured via two optional dynamic configuration values:

* `history.maxTotalUpdates`¬†controls the total number of Updates that a single Workflow Execution can support. The default is 2000.
* `history.maxInFlightUpdates`¬†controls the number of Updates that can be ‚Äúin-flight‚Äù (that is, concurrently executing, not having completed) for a given Workflow Execution. The default is 10.

Since the 1.25 release, several minor bugs have been fixed.

# Workflow Update-With-Start (public preview)

Update-With-Start sends a Workflow Update that checks whether an already-running Workflow with that ID exists. If it does, the Update is processed. If not, it starts a new Workflow Execution with the supplied ID. When starting a new Workflow, it immediately processes the Update.

Update-With-Start is great for latency-sensitive use cases.

# Activity API (pre-release)

Description:

We introduce the Activity API ‚Äî a set of APIs designed to resolve issues related to activity execution. The following APIs where introduced:

* UpdateActivityOptionsById. This API can be used by the client to update the options of an activity while activity is running.
  + The following options are supported:
    - task-queue
    - schedule-to-close-timeout
    - schedule-to-start-timeout
    - start-to-close-timeout
    - heartbeat-timeout
    - retry-initial-interval
    - retry-maximum-interval
    - retry-backoff-coefficient
    - retry-maximum-attempts
  + Partial updates are supported.
  + Timeout updates are effective immediately.
* PauseActivityById. With this API, If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously failed and is waiting for the next retry), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.
  + However, if the Activity is currently running, it will run to completion. If the Activity is on its last retry attempt and fails, the failure will be returned to the caller, just as if the Activity had not been paused. Otherwise, if it fails, it will enter a paused state.
* UnpauseActivityById . With this API clients can re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.
  + If the Activity is not running and has exceeded its retry timeout, it will be scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be scheduled when its retry timeout expires. The Activity can be retried immediately using `--no-wait`.
* ResetActivityById. With this API clients can unpauses the execution of a previously paused activity, specified by its ID.
  + Resetting an activity means:
    - number of attempts will be reset to 0.
    - activity timeouts will be reset.

Documentation is not available at this point. Do not use above APIs in production.

# Nexus

[Nexus](https://docs.temporal.io/nexus) is still in public preview for this release, but has now been enabled by default.

[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md)¬†on how to disable Nexus or how to operate it here.

Notable features and bug fixes since `v1.25.2`:

* [Allow completing a Nexus operation after workflow reset (](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/commit/34e628e104c870f0df28c0b641821396fd9c9fc7)[#6434](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/6434)[)](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/commit/34e628e104c870f0df28c0b641821396fd9c9fc7).
* Fix a few issues around replication and cancelation.
* Record NexusOperationStarted event and link when async operation completion races with the sync response path.
* Support for full Temporal Failure rehydration and encryption. Nexus handlers and workflows backing operations will now expose the full error details by default. Caller workflows will also rehydrate the original error to allow for better E2E debugging experience.
* Allow skipping application of Nexus events when resetting a workflow.

# Notable bug fixes

Primary engineer: [@prathyushpv](https://github.com/prathyushpv)

Table not found bug in sqlite.

Durations with mismatched seconds and nanoseconds signs will now fail validation and return an InvalidArgument error.

[v1.25.0](/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.25.0)

## Schema changes

Before upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.25.0, you must upgrade your core and visibility schemas to the following:

* Core:
  + MySQL schema v1.14
  + PostgreSQL schema v1.14
  + Cassandra schema v1.11
* Visibility:
  + Elasticsearch schema v7
  + MySQL schema 1.6
  + PostgreSQL schema v1.6

Please see our [upgrade documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server) for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.

## Release Highlights

### 1. Nexus

Nexus RPC is an open-source service framework for arbitrary-length operations whose lifetime may extend beyond a traditional RPC. It is an underpinning connecting durable executions within and across namespaces, clusters and regions ‚Äì with an API contract designed with multi-team collaboration in mind. A service can be exposed as a set of sync or async Nexus operations ‚Äì the latter provides an operation identifier and a uniform interface to get the status of an operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the operation.

Temporal uses the Nexus RPC protocol to allow calling across namespace and cluster boundaries. The¬†[Go SDK Nexus proposal](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/blob/master/nexus/sdk-go.md)¬†explains the user experience and shows sequence diagrams from an external perspective.

[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md) on how to enable Nexus and how to operate it here.

### 2. Workflow Update (public preview)

Workflow Update enables a gRPC client of a Workflow Execution to issue requests to that Workflow Execution and receive a response. These requests are delivered to and processed by a client-specified Workflow Execution. Updates are differentiated from Queries in that the processing of an Update is allowed to modify the state of a Workflow Execution. Updates are different from Signals in that an Update returns a response.

Any gRPC client can invoke Updates via the `WorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowExecution`. Additionally, past Update requests can be observed via the `WorkflowService.PollWorkflowExecutionUpdate` API. The wait stage option determines whether they respond once the Update was *accepted* or *completed*.

Note that an Update only becomes durable when it was *accepted*, until then, it will not appear in the Workflow history. SDKs will automatically retry to ensure Update requests complete.

The execution and retention of Updates is configured via two optional dynamic configuration values:

* `history.maxTotalUpdates` controls the total number of Updates that a single Workflow Execution can support. The default is 2000.
* `history.maxInFlightUpdates` controls the number of Updates that can be ‚Äúin-flight‚Äù (that is, concurrently executing, not having completed) for a given Workflow Execution. The default is 10.

Since the 1.21 release, the feature was heavily tested and several bug fixes as well as performance optimizations were made.

You can find more information at [this link](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-updates).

### 3. Host level MutableState cache

The `MutableState` cache has been updated to operate as a host-level cache by default. Previously, this cache was managed at the shard level, with each shard cache holding 512 `MutableState` entries. Now, the host-level cache, enabled by default (`history.enableHostHistoryCache = true`), will be shared across all shards on a given host.

The size of the host-level cache is controlled by the `history.hostLevelCacheMaxSize` configuration, which is set to 128,000 entries by default. This change may impact the memory usage of the history service, but it can be adjusted by modifying the `history.hostLevelCacheMaxSize` value.

### 4. Visibility Enhancement

Enhanced the Nexus CLI to support query filtering for the `schedule list` command. The `--query` or `-q` (string) option allows filtering of results using a specified list filter.

### 5. Task Queue Statistics

Provide stats for Task Queue backlogs to be used for worker scaling decisions.

User `DescribeTaskQueue` API in enhanced mode (with `report_stats=true`) to get the following info about the Task Queue:

* Approximate backlog count
* Approximate backlog age
* Approximate rate of adding tasks to the task queue
* Approximate rate of dispatching tasks from the task queue

[v1.24.0](/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.24.0)

Caution

This release introduces a [bug](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6050) in SQL visibility. Please DO NOT use it if you are using SQL-based (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or sqlite) visibility. Elasticsearch based visibility is not affected. Update directly to [v1.24.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.24.1).

## Schema changes

Before upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.24.0, you must upgrade your core and visibility schemas to the following:

* Core:
  + MySQL schema v1.12
  + PostgreSQL schema v1.12
  + Cassandra schema v1.10
* Visibility:
  + Elasticsearch schema v7
  + MySQL schema 1.5
  + PostgreSQL schema v1.5

Please see our [upgrade¬†documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server)¬†for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.

## Breaking changes

### Standard Visibility

As planned, standard visibility is no longer supported in this version. Please, upgrade to advanced visibility as well as the config keys to setup visibility before upgrading to this version. Refer to [v1.20.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.20.0) for upgrade instructions, and also check the [v1.21.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.0) for config key changes.

Note that you also need to update the plugin name for the main store, ie., if you are using `mysql` plugin name for the main store, then you need to change to `mysql8`. Similarly, if it's `postgres`, then change it to `postgres12`.

## Deprecation Announcements

### Worker Versioning APIs [Experimental]

The following changes were made to Worker Versioning APIs:

* Deprecated¬†`UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`¬†in favor of the new ¬†`UpdateWorkerVersioningRules` API.
* Deprecated¬†`GetWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`¬†in favor of the new¬†`GetWorkerVersioningRules` API.
* Deprecated `GetWorkerTaskReachability` in favor of `DescribeTaskQueue` enhanced mode (`api_mode=ENHANCED`)

Together with the old APIs, the Version Set concept is also deprecated and replaced with ‚Äúversioning rules‚Äù which are more powerful and flexible. More details can be found in <https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/taskqueue/v1/message.proto#L153>.

For using these experimental APIs you need to enable the following configs:

* `frontend.workerVersioningRuleAPIs`
* `frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs`

## Release Highlights

### Namespace Burst Ratio

Removing `frontend.namespaceBurst` and adding `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio` config. Similarly replacing `frontend.namespaceBurst.visibility` and `frontend.namespaceBurst.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` with `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio.visibility` and `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs`.

The old values are used to specify the burst rate as number of requests per second. New values will specify burst as a ratio of their respective RPS limit. This ratio will be applied to calculated RPS limit from global and per-instance rate limits.

### Visibility: Parent workflow execution

We added two new system search attributes: `RootWorkflowId` and `RootRunId`. If you have previously created custom search attributes with one of these names, attempts to set them will start to fail. We suggest updating your workflows to not set those search attributes, delete those search attributes and then upgrade Temporal to this version. Alternatively, you can also set the dynamic config `system.supressErrorSetSystemSearchAttribute: true`. When this dynamic config is set to `true`, your workflow will not fail when trying to set a value on a system search attribute, and it will ignore your input for those system search attributes.

### OpenAPI HTTP API Documentation

OpenAPI v2 docs are served at `/api/v1/swagger.json` while v3 is at `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` when our HTTP API is enabled.

### Shard Info Update Optimizations

Operators can now configure how often we update shard info (tracking how many tasks have been acked, etc). This improves recovery speed by persisting shard data more frequently.

This can be configured through the following dynamic config values:

* `history.shardUpdateMinTasksCompleted` - the minimum number of tasks which must be completed (across all queues) before the shard info can be updated
* `history.shardUpdateMinInterval` - the minimum amount of time between shard info updates *unless* `shardUpdateMinTasksCompleted` tasks have been acked

Note that once `history.shardUpdateMinInterval amount` of time has passed we'll update the shard info regardless of the number of tasks completed

### Interpolate MySQL query parameters by default ([#5428](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5428))

We now interpolate parameters into queries client-side for MySQL main databases but not visibility.

When `interpolateParams` is false (the default) the driver will prepare parameterized statements before executing them, meaning we need two round-trips to the database for each query. By setting `interpolateParams` to true the DB driver will handle interpolation and send the query just once to the database, halving the number of round trips necessary. This should improve the performance of all Temporal deploys using MySQL.

### OpenTelemetry env variables

Support for enabling OpenTelemetry for tracing gRPC requests via environment variables. See `develop/docs/tracing.md` for details.

### Matching task queue handover

Various improvements were made to task queue handover when adding/removing/restarting matching nodes. This should improve tail latency for task dispatch during those situations. To enable the improvements, operators should set the dynamic config `matching.alignMembershipChange` to a value like `10s` **after fully deploying** v1.24 to the entire cluster. This may become the default in future versions.

### UTF-8 validation in protobuf messages

When we migrated Temporal from the deprecated gogoproto fork of Google‚Äôs protobuf library to the official version in v1.23, we disabled protobuf‚Äôs default utf-8 validation to ensure a smooth deployment, since gogoproto did not validate fields for utf-8, and turning on validation immediately would have broken applications that accidentally used invalid utf-8.

This was a temporary measure and we will eventually re-enable validation. As the first step, we‚Äôve added tools to detect and warn about invalid utf-8 without breaking applications. There are two sets of dynamic config settings to use.

The `sample` settings are set to a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 (default 0.0), and control what proportion of either RPC requests, responses, or data read from persistence, is validated for utf-8 in strings. If invalid utf-8 is found, warnings will be sent to logs, and the counter metric `utf8_validation_errors` will be incremented.

The `fail` settings (boolean, default false) control whether a validation error will be turned into a RPC failure or data corruption error.

* `system.validateUTF8.sample.rpcRequest`
* `system.validateUTF8.sample.rpcResponse`
* `system.validateUTF8.sample.persistence`
* `system.validateUTF8.fail.rpcRequest`
* `system.validateUTF8.fail.rpcResponse`
* `system.validateUTF8.fail.persistence`

If you think your application may be using invalid utf-8, we suggesting turning on the sample settings without the fail settings and running for a while. In a future version, validation and errors will be turned on by default (effectively sample set to 1.0 and fail set to true).

### `admin-tools` docker image versioning

We separated `admin-tools` docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/admin-tools) release process. Version tag now includes versions of `tctl` (deprecated but still supported CLI) and `temporal` (modern CLI) binaries. This image is released every time whenever new version of any of these component is released. Current latest tag is [1.24.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-0.12.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/temporalio/admin-tools/1.24.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-0.12.0/images/sha256-a9ad0a14efb085d20ed04fc956c80af287359b20edbaa532b677c89a8b550ef2?context=explore).
