- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient session expiration after logout in FortiIsolator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session IDs of admin users do not expire after logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who obtains a valid, unexpired admin session ID can reuse it to gain admin privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must obtain a valid, unexpired session ID, which would require additional hypothetical attacks beyond the scope of this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to obtain an unexpired admin session ID through other unspecified means.
