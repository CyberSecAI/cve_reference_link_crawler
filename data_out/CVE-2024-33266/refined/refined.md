Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the "Tracking Center - Parcel tracking 80 carriers" module for PrestaShop, specifically in the `ajax_email.php` script, scripts in the `webservices/` directory, and the `DeliveryorderautoupdateOrdersModuleFrontController::initContent()` method.
*   The module fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is SQL injection. The module directly uses unsanitized input from HTTP requests within SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Critical Impact:** The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high risk.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive data from the database, including customer information, order details, and potentially administrative credentials.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or delete data from the database.
*   **Admin Access:** Attackers can potentially gain admin access to the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Email Hijacking:** Attackers can rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails.
*   **Webskimmer Deployment**: One of the exploits is actively used to deploy webskimmers to steal credit card information.
*  **Unlocking Admin Ajax Scripts**: Attackers can copy/paste data from sensitive tables to the front to expose tokens and unlock admin's ajax scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`ajax_email.php`, scripts in `webservices/`, and the front controller).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or user interaction. They can exploit the vulnerability as a guest.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Requires the ability to craft HTTP requests.
*   **Publicly accessible application:**  The attacker can exploit the vulnerability on a publicly accessible PrestaShop installation running the vulnerable module version.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that the `ajax_email.php` file, a key vulnerability point, was removed in later versions of the module but was not automatically deleted during upgrades, leaving older installations vulnerable.
*  The advisory emphasizes that the patch provided is partial due to over 100 critical issues inside the `webservices/` directory.
*   The exploit using the front controller can be difficult to detect in conventional front-end logs as it may only show `POST /`.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL code using a simple `curl` command against `ajax_email.php`.
*   The advisory includes patch examples for versions 2.2.2 and 2.8.1, showing how to sanitize the `lang` and `id_email` parameters by casting them to integers.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading the module, restricting access to `webservices/` directory, upgrading PrestaShop, and activating OWASP rules on the WAF as mitigation strategies.
