| Hi, I find a potential heap overflow issue in contrib/libtests/pngimage.c, function compare\_read.  The code version is commit [301f7a1](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/commit/301f7a14295a3bdfaf406dbb5004d0784dc137ea)  The compile command is `CFLAGS="-O0 -g -fsanitize=address,leak,undefined" ./configure --disable-shared`  The reproduce command `./pngimage input`  Trace reported by ASAN: `==18068==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60200000cc00 at pc 0x000000416f54 bp 0x7fffffffd0d0 sp 0x7fffffffd0c0 #0 0x416f53 in compare\_read contrib/libtests/pngimage.c:1240 [#1](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/1) 0x4249e6 in test\_one\_file contrib/libtests/pngimage.c:1484 [#2](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/2) 0x4249e6 in do\_test contrib/libtests/pngimage.c:1564 [#3](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/3) 0x405da3 in main contrib/libtests/pngimage.c:1668 [#4](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/issues/4) 0x7ffff589082f in \_\_libc\_start\_main (/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x2082f) [#5](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/5) 0x407f48 in \_start (/mnt/data/playground/libpng-libpng16-a/pngimage+0x407f48)  0x60200000cc00 is located 0 bytes to the right of 16-byte region [0x60200000cbf0,0x60200000cc00) allocated by thread T0 here: #0 0x7ffff6f02602 in malloc (/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.2+0x98602) [#1](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/1) 0x50f877 in png\_malloc\_base /mnt/data/playground/libpng-libpng16-a/pngmem.c:95 [#2](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng/pull/2) 0x50f877 in png\_malloc /mnt/data/playground/libpng-libpng16-a/pngmem.c:179  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow contrib/libtests/pngimage.c:1240 compare\_read Shadow bytes around the buggy address: 0x0c047fff9930: fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 0x0c047fff9940: fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 0x0c047fff9950: fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 0x0c047fff9960: fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 0x0c047fff9970: fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 fa fa 00 00 =>0x0c047fff9980:[fa]fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd 0x0c047fff9990: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd 0x0c047fff99a0: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd 0x0c047fff99b0: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd 0x0c047fff99c0: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd 0x0c047fff99d0: fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd fa fa fd fd Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes): Addressable: 00 Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Heap left redzone: fa Heap right redzone: fb Freed heap region: fd Stack left redzone: f1 Stack mid redzone: f2 Stack right redzone: f3 Stack partial redzone: f4 Stack after return: f5 Stack use after scope: f8 Global redzone: f9 Global init order: f6 Poisoned by user: f7 Container overflow: fc Array cookie: ac Intra object redzone: bb ASan internal: fe ==18068==ABORTING `  The reason for this overflow is that the buffer of orig and row might not have bpp length of data so that the index is out of bound in the later loop.

The attachment is the input file. [input.zip](https://github.com/glennrp/libpng/files/3325829/input.zip) |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
