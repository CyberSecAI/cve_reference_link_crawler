- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VOD Infomaniak WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into executing it, thus performing an action on their behalf without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user to visit a malicious website or click a malicious link. No specific prior access to the WordPress instance is needed.
