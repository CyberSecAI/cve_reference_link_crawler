## Enterprise Server 3.8.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.8.17/download)

March 20, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.17: Security fixes](#3.8.17-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.8.17: Bug fixes](#3.8.17-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using `ghe-spokesctl` would fail with the following error: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the patterns alerts.
### [3.8.17: Changes](#3.8.17-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for events related to the Management Console in an instance's enterprise audit log.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding.
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the webhook payload for that push will not contain any commits. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push)" and "[REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/commits)."
### [3.8.17: Known issues](#3.8.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.12 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.11 or lower
  .
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi
  pages_untar_image_tag="$(cat "$CHROOT_PATH/data/docker-image-tags/pages_untar_image_tag")"
  id="$(docker create "pages-untar:$pages_untar_image_tag")"
  sudo docker cp "$id:/data/pages-untar" "$BASE_PATH/$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar/"
  docker rm "$id"

  ```

### [3.8.16: Security fixes](#3.8.16-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled and non-default settings for GitHub Connect configured, an attacker could use an enterprise GitHub Actions download token to fetch private repository data. This token is only accessible to users on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To fix this vulnerability, the Actions download token will now be a permissionless token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-1908](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-1908) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

### [3.8.15: Bug fixes](#3.8.15-bugs)

* On startup, Elasticsearch logged an innocuous JMX MBeans registration error.
* Hunk headers in C# files did not correctly display changed functions.
* Users could not use integrations to mark a pull request as ready for review.
* During Git data server maintenance, a process that was ran on unsupported GitHub Enterprise Server topologies created a significant amount of system logs but did not perform any repair work.
### [3.8.15: Changes](#3.8.15-changes)

* The default 30 second webhook delivery HTTP timeout can be configured.
### [3.8.15: Known issues](#3.8.15-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.

* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.12 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.11 or lower
  .
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, Actions workflows that deploy GitHub Pages sites may fail with the following error:

  ```
  Error: Deployment failed, try again later.

  ```

  To fix this issue, connect to any of the instance's nodes using SSH, then run the following commands.

  ```
  if [ -d "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar" ] ; then
    rm -rf "$CHROOT_PATH/data/pages-untar"
  fi

### [3.8.12: Security fixes](#3.8.12-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the Audit Log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped personal access token. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repo. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token.

* **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4. [Updated 2024-01-03]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.8.12: Bug fixes](#3.8.12-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
* Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
* A missing executable on the PATH caused the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command to fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
### [3.8.12: Changes](#3.8.12-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.8.12: Known issues](#3.8.12-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.12 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.8.11 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
### [3.8.12: Deprecations](#3.8.12-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.11: Security fixes](#3.8.11-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.8.11: Bug fixes](#3.8.11-bugs)

* When a site administrator ran `ghe-btop` via SSH, the command did not run and a `/usr/bin/env: python3: No such file or directory` error occurred.
* Multiple lines in babeld logs could run together, making it unclear to administrators if the operations were related.
* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when managing maintenance mode using `ghe-cluster-maintenance`, an erroneous warning appeared that read "Warning: Maintenance mode set on primary, please make sure to set it on any active replica if needed".
* `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.8.11: Changes](#3.8.11-changes)

* Instructions in the "Migrations" section of the Management Console clarify that only standard AWS S3 endpoints are supported when configuring AWS S3 as a blob storage provider for migrations.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
### [3.8.11: Known issues](#3.8.11-known-issues)

* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

### [3.8.10: Security fixes](#3.8.10-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.8.10: Bug fixes](#3.8.10-bugs)

* When displaying a list of subdomains in the Management Console, the list included the outdated `render` subdomain, and excluded the newer `containers`, `docker`, `notebook`, and `viewscreen` subdomains.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* When viewing git blame data, the reviewer menu was loaded even when the suggested reviewer calculation timed out.
* When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
* Duplicated intermediate commit trailers won't appear in pull request squash messages.
* On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
### [3.8.10: Changes](#3.8.10-changes)

* Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.

### [3.8.9: Security fixes](#3.8.9-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.8.9: Bug fixes](#3.8.9-bugs)

* When an administrator tried to validate blob storage connection settings for GitHub Enterprise Importer in the Management Console using the **Test storage settings** button, the operation failed.
* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* When running the ghe-migrator, certain error messages contained an invalid link to import documentation.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to mismatched values, users could not easily associate workflow job run IDs from the GitHub Enterprise Server APIs or webhooks with a job in the UI. Workflow job runs now use a new URL pattern of `...actions/runs/job/{job_id}`, and `job_id` matches values from APIs and webhook payloads.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
* Administrators could not use the "Migrations" section in an instance's Management Console to configure blob storage for GitHub Enterprise Importer. [Updated: 2023-08-31]

### [3.8.8: Security fixes](#3.8.8-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.8.8: Bug fixes](#3.8.8-bugs)

* API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query.
* The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository.
* When running the `ghe-migrator`, certain error messages contained an invalid link to import documentation.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
### [3.8.8: Changes](#3.8.8-changes)

* The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`.
* On GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and above, a blob storage provider must be configured in the Management Console in order to use the GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI, "startRepositoryMigration" GraphQL API, or "Start an organization migration" REST API. The "Migrations" section in the Management Console was mistakenly removed and has been added back.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]

July 28, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.7: Known issues](#3.8.7-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* On an instance that is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles uploaded by a site administrator using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0 or 3.8.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.8.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* The "Migrations" section is missing from the Management Console, so it isn't possible to enable, disable, or reconfigure blob storage credentials for migrations. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
### [3.8.7: Bug fixes](#3.8.7-bugs)

* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.8.7: Changes](#3.8.7-changes)

* Adjusted the timeout threshold for shutting down MySQL to prevent premature termination when upgrading to GHES 3.9.
## Enterprise Server 3.8.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.8.6/download)

July 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.6: Security fixes](#3.8.6-security-fixes)

* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.8.6: Bug fixes](#3.8.6-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* When a user viewed a Jupyter notebook, GitHub Enterprise Server returned a `500` error code if the instance was configured with a self-signed TLS certificate.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, on some platforms, replication could perform poorly over links with very high latency.
* On an instance with custom firewall rules defined, a configuration run with `ghe-config-apply` could take longer than expected.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* When an administrator updated an instance's TLS certificate via the API as a query parameter instead of in the request body, the certificate and key appeared in `unicorn.log`.
* Jobs that performed daily clean-up tasks failed to run, so old data was not removed from the MySQL database.
* After creation of a new Management Console user, the Management Console did not display the button to copy the new users invitation.
* `ghe-service-list` erroneously reported errors because the utility looked for systemd services that have been migrated to Nomad.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, when adding a new node, connection checks between existing nodes would fail.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* In rare circumstances, Git commits signed with SSH keys using the RSA algorithm would incorrectly indicate the signature was invalid.
* After a migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer, some repository autolink references were created with an incorrect format.
* In some cases on an instance without a GitHub Advanced Security license, Redis exceeded the maximum default memory allocation, causing `500` errors for the instance's users.
* On an instance with many organizations, the enterprise security overview page returned a `500` error.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Users were unable to configure a SSH certificate authority for an organization.
* An erroneous "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link was visible in site admin pages for organizations.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, a committer would not receive an email notification for a secret scanning alert where push protections were bypassed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user filtered by a custom pattern on an organizations "Code & security analysis" page using an invalid query, the entire GitHub Advanced Security disappeared and an error reading "Sorry, something went wrong loading GitHub Advanced Security settings" appeared.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
* Querying the audit log for `hashed_token` returned no results.
* The audit log reported the incorrect target repository for pre-receive hook failures.
* Links to wiki pages in Markdown headers did not point to the correct path, resulting in a `404 Not Found` error.
* GitHub Actions will now properly execute after restoring a deleted repository.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, when using the `spokesctl` command-line utility to manage repositories with replicas that failed to fully create, the utility would spuriously attempt to repair healthy replicas.
### [3.8.6: Changes](#3.8.6-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* During initialization of a cluster configuration, output from the `ghe-cluster-config-init` command-line utility is improved and simplified.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
### [3.8.6: Known issues](#3.8.6-known-issues)

For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.8.3/download)

May 09, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.3: Security fixes](#3.8.3-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog. [Updated: 2023-07-24]
### [3.8.3: Bug fixes](#3.8.3-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role for an organization could not view GitHub Advanced Security settings for the organization.
* On an instance with a large number of organizations, enterprise owners who navigated to the "Security and analysis" settings page for the enterprise could return a `500` error.
* From GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 onwards, using the GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI, the `startRepositoryMigration` GraphQL API, or the “Start an organization migration” REST API requires a blob storage provider to be configured in the Management Console. When using Azure Blob Storage, storage containers were incorrectly configured to be publicly accessible. Azure Blob Storage containers will now be configured to be private, and we have introduced a check that explicitly fails exports if the storage container is public.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, alerts were erroneously hidden when different vulnerabilities were detected by multiple build-time submission detectors.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license where secret scanning is enabled, excessive logging in `/var/log` could cause user-facing errors and degrade system performance if logs consumed all free space on the volume.
### [3.8.3: Changes](#3.8.3-changes)

* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, background services can handle more traffic.
* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.
* After a site administrator exports a migration archive using GitHub Enterprise Importers `gh-migrator` utility, the link to the archive remains accessible for 48 hours instead of one hour.
### [3.8.3: Known issues](#3.8.3-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0 or 3.8.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.8.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* During an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.0 on a cluster, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following error may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* On an instance with audit log streaming enabled, the `driftwood` service does not start, preventing the normal operation of audit log streaming. [Updated: 2023-06-06]
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]

April 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.2: Security fixes](#3.8.2-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
### [3.8.2: Bug fixes](#3.8.2-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* Download requests for Git LFS objects did not complete until reporting the final download size, which affected the latency of these requests, particularly on an instance with nodes functioning as repository caches.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* When a site administrator ran `ghe-btop` via SSH, the command did not run and a `/usr/bin/env: python3: No such file or directory` error occurred.
* Site administrators who prepared to enable GitHub Actions could not run the `ghe-actions-precheck` utility because the scripts file was not executable.
* In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com.
* After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instance's list of organizations.
* After a site administrator exported a migration archive to AWS S3 using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the URL for the archive was inaccessible.
* If a site administrator exported a migration archive to a bucket in AWS S3s us-east-1 region using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the archive was inaccessible.
* Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages.
### [3.8.2: Changes](#3.8.2-changes)

* If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
* After a site administrator exports a migration archive using GitHub Enterprise Importer's `gh-migrator` utility, the link to the archive remains accessible for 48 hours instead of one hour.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users who author custom patterns for secret scanning can provide expressions that must or must not match that are up to 2,000 characters. This limit is an increase from 1,000 characters.
### [3.8.2: Known issues](#3.8.2-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."

## Enterprise Server 3.8.1

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.1](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.8.1/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.8.1: Security fixes](#3.8.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.8.1: Bug fixes](#3.8.1-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a workflow job for GitHub Actions would not start if a matching runner group was unavailable when the job was initially queued, even if a matching runner group became available after the job entered the queue.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions will now properly execute after restoration of a deleted repository.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* Commands that site administrators ran via SSH on any of the instances nodes were not logged in `/var/log/ssh-console-audit.log`.
* On instances configured to use the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, users' authentication with SSH keys and personal access tokens failed due to an erroneous requirement for authorization.
* After a user imported a repository with push protection enabled, the repository was not immediately visible in the security overview's "Security Coverage" view.
* Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error.
* When users searched for gists, the text in the search field was not visible in some cases because the texts color was identical to the color of the fields background.
* In some cases on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server erroneously stopped writing to replica fileservers, causing repository data to fall out of sync.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com.
* An enterprise owner could not enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an instance if any enterprise owners had not enabled 2FA for their user accounts. [Updated: 2023-04-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Packages enabled, after users pushed to the Container registry, the instance erroneously responded with a `429 Too Many Requests` error in cases when the instance could accommodate the request. The limits have been raised, and users should receive this message less often. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
### [3.8.1: Changes](#3.8.1-changes)

* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users who author custom patterns for secret scanning can provide expressions that must or must not match that are up to 2,000 characters. This limit is an increase from 1,000 characters.
### [3.8.1: Known issues](#3.8.1-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0 or 3.8.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.8.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`.

[Updated: 2023-07-31]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```

March 07, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.8.17) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.8.0: Features](#3.8.0-features)

* #### [Projects beta](#projects-beta)

  + Projects, the flexible tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub Enterprise Server, is now available as a beta. A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates issues and pull requests to help users plan and track work effectively. Users can create and customize multiple views, and each view can filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. Users can also define custom fields to track the unique metadata for a team or project, allowing customization for any needs or processes. This feature is subject to change. For more information, see "[About Projects (beta)](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)."
* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + Site administrators can improve the security of an instance by creating dedicated user accounts for the Management Console. Only the root site administrator can create user accounts. To control access for the user accounts, assign either the editor or operator role. Operators can manage administrative SSH access for the instance. For more information, see "[Managing access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/managing-access-to-the-management-console)."
  + To establish or comply with internal policies, site administrators can use the Management Console to configure an instance's policy for retention of data related to checks, including checks data generated by GitHub Actions and the Statuses API. Administrators can enable or disable retention, set a custom retention threshold, or set a custom hard-delete threshold.
    For more information, see "[Configuring applications](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-applications)" [Updated: 2023-03-02]
  + When generating support bundles using the `ghe-support-bundle` command-line utility, site administrators can specify the exact duration to use for collection of data in the bundle. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-support-bundle)."
* #### [Identity and access management](#identity-and-access-management)

  + Users can review and revoke both browser and GitHub Mobile sessions for a GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information, see "[Viewing and managing your sessions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/viewing-and-managing-your-sessions)."
* #### [Policies](#policies)

  + Enterprise owners can configure whether repository administrators can enable or disable Dependabot alerts. On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, enterprise owners can also set policies to control whether repository administrators can enable GitHub Advanced Security features or secret scanning. For more information, see "[Enforcing policies for code security and analysis for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-code-security-and-analysis-for-your-enterprise)."
* #### [Audit logs](#audit-logs)

  + Enterprise and organization owners can support adherance to the principle of least privilege by granting access to audit log endpoints without providing full administrative privileges. To provide this access, personal access tokens and OAuth apps now support the `read:audit_log` scope. For more information, see "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise)."
  + Enterprise owners can more easily detect and trace activity associated with authentication tokens by viewing token data in audit log events. For more information, see "[Identifying audit log events performed by an access token](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/identifying-audit-log-events-performed-by-an-access-token)."
  + Enterprise owners can configure audit log streaming to a Datadog endpoint. For more information, see "[Streaming the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#setting-up-streaming-to-datadog)."
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can view changes to GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning, and push protection enablement in the audit log. Organization owners can view changes to custom messages for push protection in the audit log. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[`business_secret_scanning` category actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning-category-actions)," "[`business_secret_scanning_push_protection` category actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning_push_protection-category-actions)," and "[`business_secret_scanning_push_protection_custom_message` category actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning_push_protection_custom_message-category-actions)" in "Audit log events for your enterprise"
    - "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#org-category-actions)"
  + Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can ensure compliance and simplify the rollout of secret scanning and push protection to all organizations on the instance using the REST API. This endpoint supplements the existing web UI, as well as the endpoints for repositories and organizations. For more information, see "[Code security and analysis](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/enterprise-admin/code-security-and-analysis?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Enterprise and organization owners who use secret scanning on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use the REST API to specify a custom link to display when push protection blocks a push containing a secret. For more information, see "[Code security and analysis](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/enterprise-admin/code-security-and-analysis?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" or "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#update-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license who dismiss a secret scanning alert can help other users understand the reason for dismissal by providing an optional comment using the web UI or REST API. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Managing alerts from secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)"
    - "[Secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/secret-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28#update-a-secret-scanning-alert)" in the REST API documentation
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can filter results from the Code Scanning API based on alert severity at either the repository or organization levels. Use the `severity` parameter to return only code scanning alerts with a specific severity. For more information, see "[Code Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/code-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-a-repository)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can analyze two additional languages for vulnerabilities and errors using CodeQL code scanning. Support for Ruby is generally available, and support for Kotlin is in beta and subject to change.

    - Ruby analysis can detect more than twice the number of common weaknesses (CWEs) it could detect during beta. A total of 30 rules can identify a range of vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS), regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS), SQL injection, and more. Additional library and framework coverage for Ruby-on-Rails ensures that web service developers get even more precise results. GitHub Enterprise Server supports all common Ruby versions, up to and including 3.1.
    - Kotlin support is an extension of existing Java support, and benefits from the [existing CodeQL queries for Java](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/), which apply to both mobile and server-side applications. GitHub has also improved and added a range of mobile-specific queries, covering issues such as handling of Intents, Webview validation problems, fragment injection, and more.

    For more information about code scanning, see "[About code scanning with CodeQL](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql)."
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license who use CodeQL code scanning can customize the build configuration for Go analysis within the GitHub Actions workflow file. Existing CodeQL workflows for Go analysis require no changes, and will continue to be supported. For more information, see "[Configuring the CodeQL workflow for compiled languages](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages#adding-build-steps-for-a-compiled-language)."
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + To improve code security and simplify the process of updating vulnerable dependencies, more users can receive automatic pull requests with dependency updates.

    - GitHub Actions authors can automatically update dependencies within workflow files.
    - Dart or Flutter developers who use Pub can automatically update dependencies within their projects.

    For more information, see "[About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates)."
  + Dart and JavaScript developers on an instance with the dependency graph enabled can receive Dependabot alerts for known vulnerabilities within a project's dependencies.

    - For Dart, the dependency graph detects `pubspec.lock` and `pubspec.yaml` files.
    - JavaScript developers who use Node.js and npm can receive alerts for known vulnerabilities within Yarn v2 and v3 manifests. This supplements the existing support for v1 manifests. The dependency graph detects `package.json`, and `yarn.lock` files.

    For more information, see the following articles.

    - "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)"
    - "[Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database)"
    - "[About Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)"
  + Python developers who use supported package managers on an instance with the dependency graph enabled can receive Dependabot alerts for dependencies within `pyproject.toml` files that follow the [PEP 621 standard](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/). For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates#supported-repositories-and-ecosystems)."
  + Python developers who receive Dependabot alerts can reduce the number of version updates when a current dependency requirement is already satisfied by a new version. To configure this behavior, use the `increase-if-necessary` versioning strategy. For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#versioning-strategy)."
  + Enterprise owners can retrieve Dependabot alerts for the instance using the REST API. This endpoint is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/dependabot/alerts?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Organization owners can retrieve Dependabot alerts for the organization using the REST API. This endpoint is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/dependabot/alerts?apiVersion=2022-11-28)."
  + Users can programmatically view and act on Dependabot alerts using the REST API. New endpoints to view, list, and update Dependabot alerts are available in beta. These endpoints are subject to change. For more information, see "[Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/dependabot/alerts?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + To increase visibility into security posture and improve risk analysis, users can access coverage and risk views within the security overview. The coverage view shows enablement across repositories, while the risk view surfaces alerts across repositories. Organization owners, security managers, and repository administrators on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can enable security features from the security overview's coverage view. The views replace the "Overview" page, and are in public beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[About the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/security-overview/about-the-security-overview)."
  + Contributors can define a repository's security policy by creating a `SECURITY.md` file. To increase the policy's visibility, GitHub Enterprise Server will link to the policy from the repository's  **Code** tab. For more information, see "[Adding a security policy to your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)."
  + The Dependency review API is generally available, and the associated GitHub Action now allows users to reference a local or external configuration file. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/dependency-graph/dependency-review?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation
    - "[Configuring dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/configuring-dependency-review#about-configuring-the-dependency-review-action)"
  + The GraphQL API provides access to a repository's dependency graph. This feature is in preview and subject to change. For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/objects#dependencygraphdependency)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + During configuration of storage for GitHub Actions, site administrators can avoid risks associated with the input of sensitive secrets and access keys by using OIDC to connect to object storage providers. GitHub Actions on GitHub Enterprise Server supports OIDC for connections to AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Enabling GitHub Actions for GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server)."
  + To prevent untrusted logging of data from the `set-state` and `set-output` workflow commands, action authors can use environment files for the management of state and output.

    - To use this feature, the runner application must be version 2.297.0 or later. Versions 2.298.2 and later will warn users who use the `save-state` or `set-output` commands. These commands will be fully disabled in a future release.
    - To use the updated `saveState` and `setOutput` functions, workflows using the GitHub Actions Toolkit must call `@actions/core` v1.10.0 or later.

    For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#environment-files)."
  + The ability to share actions and reusable workflows from private repositories is generally available. Users can share workflows in a private repository with other private repositories owned by the same organization or user account, or with all private repositories on the instance. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#allowing-access-to-components-in-a-private-repository)"
    - "[GitHub Actions Permissions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/actions/permissions?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-the-level-of-access-for-workflows-outside-of-the-repository)" in the REST API documentation
  + Users can improve workflow readability and avoid the need to store non-sensitive configuration data as encrypted secrets by defining configuration variables, which allow reuse across workflows in a repository or organization. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Variables](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows)."
  + Users can dynamically name workflow runs. `run-name` accepts expressions, and the dynamic name appears in the list of workflow runs. For more information, see "[Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#run-name)."
  + Users can prevent a job from running on a runner outside the intended group by defining the names of the intended runner groups for a workflow within the `runs-on` key.

    ```
    runs-on:
      group: my-group
      labels: [ self-hosted, label-1 ]

    ```

    Additionally, GitHub Enterprise Server will no longer allow the creation of runner groups with identical names at the organization and enterprise level. A warning banner will appear for any runner groups within an organization that share a name with a runner group for the enterprise.
  + Users can enforce standard CI/CD practices across all of an organization's repositories by defining required workflows. These workflows are triggered as required status checks for all pull requests that target repositories' default branch, which blocks merging until the check passes. This feature is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Required workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/using-workflows/required-workflows)."
  + To enable standardization of OIDC configurations across cloud deployment workflows, organization owners and repository administrators can configure the `subject` claim format within OIDC tokens by defining a custom template. For more information, see "[About security hardening with OpenID Connect](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#customizing-the-subject-claims-for-an-organization-or-repository)."
  + To enable more transparency and control over cache usage within repositories, users who cache dependencies and other reused files with `actions/cache` can manage caches from the instance's web UI. For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#managing-caches)."
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + Users can set expectations surrounding availability by displaying a local timezone within their profiles. People who view the user's profile or hovercard will see the timezone, as well as how many hours behind or ahead they are of the user's local time. For more information, see "[Personalizing your profile](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#setting-your-location-and-time-zone)."
* #### [GitHub Discussions](#github-discussions)

  + To improve discoverability, GitHub Discussions features the following improvements.

    - Repository owners can pin discussions to a specific category.
    - Category titles and descriptions are displayed on the category's page.
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + To manage how organization members fork repositories, organization owners can set a dedicated forking policy for any organization. This policy must be stricter than an a forking policy set for the enterprise. For more information, see "[Managing the forking policy for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization)."
  + Organization owners can improve organization security by preventing outside collaborators from requesting the installation of GitHub and OAuth apps. For more information, see "[Limiting OAuth App and GitHub App access requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/organizations/managing-organization-settings/limiting-oauth-app-and-github-app-access-requests)."
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + To avoid providing full administrative access to a repository when unnecessary, repository administrators can create a custom role that allows users to bypass branch protections. To enforce branch protections for all users with administrative access or bypass permissions, administrators can enable **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**. For more information, see "[Managing custom repository roles for an organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository)" and "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#do-not-allow-bypassing-the-above-settings)."
  + Repository administrators can ensure the security and stability of branches by locking the branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#lock-branch)."
  + In scenarios where someone should review code within a GitHub Actions workflow before the workflow runs, repository administrators can require approval from a user with write access to the repository before a workflow run can be triggered from a private fork. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-forks-of-private-repositories)."
* #### [Issues](#issues)

  + The GraphQL API supports creation and removal of the link between a branch and an issue. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Creating a branch to work on an issue](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue)"
    - "[createLinkedBranch](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/mutations#createlinkedbranch)" and "[deleteLinkedBranch](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/mutations#deletelinkedbranch)" in the "Mutations" GraphQL API documentation
    - "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/objects#issue)" in the GraphQL API documentation
* #### [Releases](#releases)

  + Users can mark a specific release within a repository as the latest release using the web UI, REST API, or GraphQL API. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Managing releases in a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)"
    - "[Releases](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-release)" in the REST API documentation
    - "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/objects#release)" in the GraphQL API documentation
* #### [Integrations](#integrations)

  + Users can save time and switch context less often by receiving and acting on real-time updates about GitHub Enterprise Server activity directly within Slack or Microsoft Teams. GitHub's integrations for these services are now generally available. For more information, see "[GitHub extensions and integrations](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/get-started/customizing-your-github-workflow/exploring-integrations/github-extensions-and-integrations)."
### [3.8.0: Changes](#3.8.0-changes)

* When a site administrator runs a command using administrative SSH access, the command is now logged. To help GitHub Support troubleshoot and debug, support bundles include a log containing these commands.
* To simplify the discovery of events within enterprise, organization, or user audit logs, the search bar now displays a list of available filters.
* Before a site administrator can migrate away from GitHub Enterprise Server using the [GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI](https://github.com/github/gh-gei), the [startRepositoryMigration](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/graphql/reference/mutations#startrepositorymigration) GraphQL API, or the [Start an organization migration](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/rest/migrations/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#start-an-organization-migration) REST API, the administrator must use the Management Console to configure a blob storage provider for the storage of migration archives. Supported provides include Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Previously, blob storage was not required and could optionally be configured using `gh gei`. This change adds support for migrations where the Git source or metadata is larger than 1 GB.
* To help users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license better understand detected secrets and take action, secret scanning alerts concerning third-party API keys now include a link to the provider's documentation. For more information, see "[About secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning)."
* Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license will now see the actions that users took on a secret scanning alert directly within the alert's timeline, including when a contributor bypassed push protection for a secret.
* Instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license will regularly run a historical scan to detect newly added secret types on repositories with GitHub Advanced Security and secret scanning enabled. Previously, users needed to manually run a historical scan.
* On instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license, to ensure that future releases of GitHub Enterprise Server can always display a preview of a detected secret in the APIs or web UI, the detected secrets are now stored separately from source code. Detected secrets are stored using symmetric encryption. [Updated: 2023-02-15]
* When using private registries for Dependabot updates, GitHub Enterprise Server behaves more securely. If a private registry is configured for any of the following ecosystems, the instance will no longer make any package requests to public registries.

  + Bundler
  + Docker
  + Gradle
  + Maven
  + npm
  + Nuget
  + Python
  + Yarn

  For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries)."
* Elixir developers who use [self-hosted Hex repositories](https://hex.pm/docs/self_hosting) can configure a private registry for Dependabot version updates on GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#configuration-options-for-private-registries)."
* Dependabot alerts features the following usability improvements.

  + The page for an alert refreshes automatically after Dependabot attempts to create a pull request for an update.
  + Alerts are more accurately mapped to pull requests from Dependabot updates.
  + To improve the alert for the community, users can suggest improvements to alerts directly in the GitHub Advisory Database.
* Users can more easily mention **@dependabot**. When mentioning users, the Dependabot user account now appears as an autocomplete suggestion.
* In repositories with vulnerable dependencies, Dependabot will no longer display a yellow banner. To notify contributors of vulnerable dependencies, the **Security** tab displays an alert counter.
* If a user forks a repository with an existing Dependabot configuration in `dependabot.yml`, Dependabot updates will be disabled in the fork by default. To enable updates in the fork, the user must visit the repository's code security and analysis settings. For more information, see "[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)."
* Integrators who wish to receive a webhook for Dependabot alerts must use the new `dependabot_alert` webhook. This webhook replaces the `repository_vulnerability_alert` webhook. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#dependabot_alert)."
* To improve readability of GitHub Actions workflows that reference other actions by commit SHA, action authors often write a comment including the corresponding semantic version on the line that calls the action. To save time, pull requests for Dependabot version updates will now automatically update the semantic version in these comments.
* JavaScript developers who use Node.js, npm, and Dependabot security updates can save time when updating npm projects with transitive dependencies.

  + Dependabot can update both parent and child dependencies together. Previously, Dependabot would not update transitive dependencies when the parent required an incompatible specific version range, requiring manual upgrades.
  + Dependabot can create pull requests that resolve alerts where an update to a direct dependency would remove the vulnerable transitive dependency from the tree.

  For more information, see "[About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates)."
* For people who use Dependabot for version updates in the Docker ecosystem, Dependabot will proactively update Docker image tags in Kubernetes manifests. For more information, see "[Configuring Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#package-ecosystem)."
* A number of improvements are available to users who contribute to security advisories on GitHub.com, including the following changes.

  + To ensure faster review, GitHub prompts users to add a reason for the change.
  + To ensure that the contribution matches the user's intent, GitHub will not reorder reference links in the diff.
* GitHub Actions features the following discoverability and accessibility improvements.

  + The navigation experience for searching workflows and workflow runs is improved.
  + Added structure better represents the hierarchy between caller and called reusable workflows.
  + The mobile browsing experience is more consistent, and supports multiple viewport sizes.
* GitHub Actions workflows will no longer trigger endlessly when using `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `workflow_dispatch` and `repository_dispatch` events. Prior to this change, events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not create a new workflow run. For more information, see "[Triggering a workflow](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow)."
* For scheduled runs of GitHub Actions workflows, users will see additional information about the repository, organization, and enterprise within the payload for `github.event`.
* Users of GitHub Actions have better insight into the progress of a job when using environment protection rules. The `workflow_job` webhook supports a new `waiting` state whenever a job is awaiting an environment protection rule. Also, when a job refers to an `environment` key in its YAML definition, the `workflow_job` webhook payload will also include a new property, `deployment`. `deployment` contains metadata about the deployment that the check run created. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."
* Organization owners can find more meaningful context within audit log events.

  + `business.sso_response` and `org.sso_response` events appear in the REST API and payloads for audit log streaming.
  + `repo.rename`, `project.rename`, and `protected_branch.update_name` events include the current and past names for these renamed within the `old_name` field.
  + Events for Dependabot alerts contain `alert_number`, `ghsa_id`, `dismiss_reason`, and `dismiss_comment` fields, in addition to a link back to the alert and an accurate timestamp.
* Users can view a list that contains all of an organization's followers from the organization's profile.
* The banner displayed atop an archived repository in the web UI now includes the repository's archival date.
* The **Conversations** and **Files** tabs in pull requests now load more quickly due to deferred syntax highlighting.
* To provide a more consistent experience between the web UI and users' workstations, and to speed up the process of checking whether users can merge a pull request automatically, GitHub Enterprise Server now uses the `merge-ort` strategy. For more information, see [Merge strategies](https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies#Documentation/merge-strategies.txt-ort) in the Git documentation.
* To improve the display of the initial comment in pull requests that contain one commit, GitHub Enterprise Server now automatically reformats detailed commit messages to adhere to GitHub's Markdown conventions.
* Before squash-merging a pull request, the web UI displays the email address of the commit's author. Previously, the commit author was only displayed when merging with a merge commit.
### [3.8.0: Known issues](#3.8.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0 or 3.8.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.8.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* In some cases, while converting an issue to a discussion, the conversion process may hang. In this situation, an enterprise owner can try the following troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

  1. At the end of the stuck discussion's URL, note the discussion's number.
  2. In the web UI, browse to the repository where the conversion is stuck.
  3. In the top-right corner of the web UI, click .
  4. Under "Collaboration", click **NUMBER discussions**.
  5. In the list, click the number from step 1.
  6. Under "Conversion", click **Enqueue conversion job**.
  7. Wait a few minutes, then check the issue's status.

  If the conversion still hasn't completed, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* During an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.0 on a cluster, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following error may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8.0, commands run via SSH on any of the instance's nodes will not be logged in `/var/log/ssh-console-audit.log`. To resolve this issue, SSH into the affected node and run the following command.

  ```
  source /etc/bash.bashrc

  ```
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, site administrators should only run the `ghe-repl-start` and `ghe-repl-stop` commands while the instance is in maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode)" and "[About high availability configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/about-high-availability-configuration#utilities-for-replication-management)." [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* Use of the search API may cause subsequent requests to other interfaces to fail. When this issue occurs, impacted API or web UI users will receive HTTP 5xx responses and this `NoMethodError` exception will be logged:

  ```
  NoMethodError (undefined method `starts_with?' for [:ok, "refs/heads/main"]:Array):

  ```
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license where secret scanning is enabled, excessive logging in `/var/log` may cause user-facing errors and degraded system performance if logs consume all free space on the volume. To prevent this issue from impacting users, monitor free space on your instance's root volume. For more information, see "[Configuring secret scanning for your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-secret-scanning-for-your-appliance)" and "[Monitoring your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/enterprise-management/monitoring-your-appliance)." If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance and you need help, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-05-03]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
### [3.8.0: Deprecations](#3.8.0-deprecations)

* #### [Unsecure algorithms disabled for administrative SSH connections](#unsecure-algorithms-disabled-for-administrative-ssh-connections)

  + GitHub has disabled the use of unsecure algorithms for SSH connections to the administrative shell.
* #### [Deprecation of the repository\_vulnerability\_alert webhook](#deprecation-of-the-repository_vulnerability_alert-webhook)

  + For integrators who wish to receive webhooks for Dependabot alerts activity, the `dependabot_alert` webhook replaces the `repository_vulnerability_alert` webhook. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#dependabot_alert)."
### [3.8.0: Errata](#3.8.0-errata)

* "[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
* "[Repositories](#3.8.0-repositories)" incorrectly indicated that repository administrators can require pull request approval by someone other than the last pusher. This feature is unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8, and is available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10. For more information, see "[Release notes](/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/release-notes#repositories)." [Updated 2023-08-07]

## Enterprise Server 3.9.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.18/download)

July 19, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

Note

Due to a bug that caused hotpatch upgrades to fail for instances on Microsoft Azure, the previous patch release in this series (**3.9.17**) is not available for download. The following release notes include the updates introduced in that release.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.17-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.18: Security fixes](#3.9.18-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker could cause unbounded resource exhaustion on the instance by sending a large payload to the Git server. To mitigate this issue, GitHub has limited the count of "have" and "want" lines for Git read operations. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5795](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5795) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An improper privilege management vulnerability allowed users to migrate private repositories without having appropriate scopes defined on the related personal access token. GitHub has requested CVE ID CVE-2024-5566 for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized access in a public repository using a suspended GitHub App via a scoped user access token. This was only exploitable in public repositories while private repositories were not impacted. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5816](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-5816) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could execute a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to perform write operations on a victim-owned repository in GitHub Enterprise Server by exploiting incorrect request types. A mitigating factor is that the attacker has to be a trusted user and the victim has to visit a tag in the attacker's fork of their own repository. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5815](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5815) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information from a private repository exploiting organization ruleset features. This attack required an organization member to explicitly change the visibility of a dependent repository from private to public. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-6336](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6336) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM:** An attacker could have unauthorized read access to issue content inside an internal repository via GitHub projects. This attack required attacker access to the corresponding project board. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-5817](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5817) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **LOW:** An attacker with read access to a project could use the REST API to view a list of all members in an organization, including members who had made their membership private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* **LOW:** An attacker could include MathJax syntax in Markdown to bypass GitHubs normal restrictions on CSS properties in Markdown. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program.
* Firewall port 9199, which linked to a static maintenance page used when enabling maintenance mode with an IP exception list, was opened unnecessarily.
### [3.9.18: Bug fixes](#3.9.18-bugs)

* When an instance hosted on Azure was upgraded with a hotpatch, the upgrade failed with an `rsync` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, remote blob storage could fill up with large amounts of data because cleanup jobs were skipped on old hosts.
* The memory limit for a Redis job was too low in some cases, causing the process to run out of memory.
* In some cases, commands run in an administrative SSH shell were not written to the audit log.
* When an administrator submitted a support data to GitHub Support, spokesd keys were incorrectly sanitized.
* When log forwarding was enabled, some specific service logs, including babeld, gitauth, unicorn, and resqued, were duplicated.
* During the initial boot of an instance, a data disk attached as `/dev/sdb` may not have been recognized as an available disk.
* In some cases, the HAProxy `kill_timeout` setting caused service outages during upgrades or large transactions.
* The `ssh-audit-log.sh` script did not effectively log SSH commands, and the `ghe-sanitize-log.psed` script inadequately sanitized password-related logs
* The default MSSQL timeout of 8 seconds sometimes caused issues during administrator activities. The default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
* For an instance running on Microsoft Azure, the user disk service failed to start because the attached volume could not be found.
* Establishing a new GitHub Connect connection could fail with a 500 error.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to migrate a repository, the links for pull requests merge commits were not imported.
* In some cases, reading data from repositories with a large number of objects would result in timeout or error.
* On an instance that restricts emails to verified domains, secret scanning emails would sometimes be sent to an unverified domain.
* In some cases, on the "Files" tab of a pull request, a comment on the first line did not render.
* Some organizations were not recognized as part of an instance's enterprise account.
* On the "Code scanning" page of a repository, the branch filter did not correctly display all branches.
* Users viewing the alerts index page experienced inconsistencies in rendering the closed alert state.
* Organizations named "C" were incorrectly routed to the GitHub Enterprise Server contact page instead of their organization page.
* Chat integrations required frequent reauthentication, as a result of new app installations overwriting previous ones.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command did not select the correct Nomad container when running a command within a git repository.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, disabling and re-enabling GitHub Advanced Security for an organization resulted in redundant scans of some repositories.
### [3.9.18: Changes](#3.9.18-changes)

* When a user changes a repository's visibility to public, the user is now warned that previous Actions history and logs will become public as well.
### [3.9.18: Known issues](#3.9.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* The reply.[hostname] subdomain is falsely always displaying as having no ssl and dns record, when testing the domain settings via management console **without subdomain isolation**.
* *Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.*
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.15-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.15: Security fixes](#3.9.15-security-fixes)

* **CRITICAL**: On instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user with administrator privileges.

  Please note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions are not impacted. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow unauthorized access to the instance without requiring prior authentication. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-4985](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4985) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.9.14

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.14](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.14/download)

May 08, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.14-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.14: Security fixes](#3.9.14-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.14: Bug fixes](#3.9.14-bugs)

* Running `ghe-repl-node -d` did not validate value length in order to prevent values longer than 20 characters.
* For an instance in a cluster configuration, during the migration phase of a configuration run, the process of copying configuration updates to all nodes would fail.
* External collaborators with read-only access were able to run workflows on their pull requests from private forks without approval.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, custom pattern matches were incorrectly filtered during post-scan filtering.
### [3.9.14: Changes](#3.9.14-changes)

* To aid in understanding the CPU/memory utilization of secret scanning processes, the binary names of nomad workers were updated to differentiate between the different types of secret scanning jobs.
* A more specific error message is shown when the `ghe-repl-node` command is run on an instance not configured for high availability.
### [3.9.14: Known issues](#3.9.14-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.13](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.13/download)

April 18, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.13-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.13: Security fixes](#3.9.13-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with the editor role in the Management Console could gain administrative SSH access to the appliance by command injection when configuring the chat integration. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-3646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). The editor role has been deprecated. For more information, see the "Changes" section of these release notes.
* **HIGH**: An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring Artifact & Logs and Migrations Storage. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-3684](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3684) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a detached repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions while the repository is detached. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2440](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2440) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* A GraphQL endpoint was disabled as part of a previous security fix, causing errors with the "Auto-add to project" workflow and with issue creation from within a project. To resolve these errors, a security patch has been applied and the affected GraphQL endpoint has been re-enabled.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.13: Bug fixes](#3.9.13-bugs)

* When configuring audit log streaming to Datadog or Splunk on an instance with custom CA certificates, the connection failed with the error `There was an error trying to connect`.
* Disk usage, utilization, and latency for data devices could render incorrectly in Grafana.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, former primary nodes were able to access the newly promoted nodes after failover. The `ghe-cluster-failover` command has been updated to block access from the old cluster, and four new command-line utilities have been introduced to manually block IP addresses: `ghe-cluster-block-ips`, `ghe-cluster-block-ip`, `ghe-cluster-unblock-ips`, and `ghe-cluster-unblock-ip`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-cluster-failover)." [Updated: 2024-05-01]
* The `ghe-update-check` command did not clean up .tmp files in `/var/lib/ghe-updates/`, which could lead to full disk issues.
* On an instance that failed a configuration run, when attempting to repeat the restore step of a backup, the audit log restore step returned error lines even though audit logs were being fully restored.
* In some cases, Treelights timeouts caused pull requests to return a 500 error.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some searches for secret scanning alerts resulted in a `500` error.
* The web UI presented inapplicable fine-grained permissions for assignment to custom repository roles. The permissions were also displayed as implicitly included in certain base roles.
* The profile settings for organizations displayed a warning about profile images that does not apply to organizations on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* Administrators could get a 500 error when trying to access the "File storage" section of the site admin dashboard.
* On an instance where user avatars had been deleted directly from the database, an identicon avatar was not correctly displayed for affected users, and administrators may have observed a relatively high number of application exceptions.
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, on the tool status page for code scanning, outdated upload errors were still displayed after a successful upload.
### [3.9.13: Changes](#3.9.13-changes)

* On an instance hosted on Azure, administrators can set and reset SSH keys and passwords via the Azure Agent.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, MySQL replica nodes can be configured to skip database seeding. For more information, see "[Deferring database seeding](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/deferring-database-seeding)."
* As a result of a security vulnerability, the editor role for a Management Console user has been deprecated. For details, see the "Security fixes" section of these release notes. Existing users with the editor role will be unable to log in to the Management Console, and should contact their site administrator requesting that access be reinstated by updating the user to the operator role if appropriate.
### [3.9.13: Known issues](#3.9.13-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.12-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.12: Security fixes](#3.9.12-security-fixes)

* **HIGH:** An attacker with an Administrator role in GitHub Enterprise Server could gain SSH root access via remote code execution. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2469](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2469) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH:** An attacker with an editor role in the Management Console could gain SSH access to the instance by command injection when configuring GeoJSON settings. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-2443](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-2443) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.12: Bug fixes](#3.9.12-bugs)

* In some cases, storage initialization on a new instance launch could cause EBS-backed data volumes to not be detected correctly.
* Redundant messages caused an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`.
* Administrators could initiate an SSH audit that unknowingly unverified all SSH keys.
* Attributes used to debug LDAP issues were not included in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, the `ghe-spokesctl` command failed when run on a replica node.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, GitHub Actions workflows that deployed GitHub Pages sites failed with the following error: `Error: Deployment failed, try again later.`
* Organizations using projects (classic) returned an error log about a soon-to-be deprecated MySQL feature when viewing a project.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, Jupyter notebooks did not render correctly.
* In some cases, manual repository maintenance using ghe-spokesctl would fail with the following error: panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, in some cases, when a user deleted a custom pattern for secret scanning, GitHub Enterprise Server failed to close or delete the pattern's alerts.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with many nodes, requests to the REST API for managing GitHub Enterprise Server would exceed the instance's HTTP timeouts.
* In some cases, the `codeload` service could panic during shutdown and not terminate gracefully.
* When an administrator set a policy to require two-factor authentication (2FA) for an enterprise, a message incorrectly indicated that users without 2FA enabled on their account would be removed from the enterprise. These users will be removed from repositories and organizations in the enterprise, but not from the enterprise itself.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, viewing a secret scanning alert as a user without the security manager role would return a `500` error if the alert was generated from a Git tag instead of a normal commit.
* When using GitHub Enterprise Importer to import repositories, `ghost` users in archive metadata files would cause an error when generating a list of migration conflicts using `ghe-migrator conflicts`.
* Some API endpoints for projects did not properly filter target repositories based on the users access.
* After an administrator ran `ghe-saml-mapping-csv`, the output did not include the corresponding SQL query.
* During a configuration run prompted by the delayed restart of the `notebooks` service, a container validation warning appeared in system logs.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, rebuilds of GitHub Pages sites failed if no replicas of the GitHub Pages data were available (for example, on a newly restored cluster).
* On an instance with code scanning enabled, upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9 or 3.10 could be slow if a large number of code scanning analyses were present on the instance.
### [3.9.12: Changes](#3.9.12-changes)

* Gists can be deleted using the **Purge Gist** button on the Deleted Gists page in Staff Tools.
* People deploying a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in AWS can now deploy in an environment that uses Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
* The payload for the `push` webhook event is now limited to 2,048 commits. If there are more than 2,048 commits in a push, the payload for the push webhook will not contain serialized diff information for each commit. If you need to fetch commit information, you can use the Commits endpoints of the REST API. For more information, see "[Webhook events and payloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push)" and "[REST API endpoints for commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/commits)."

## Enterprise Server 3.9.11

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.11](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.11/download)

February 29, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.11-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.11: Security fixes](#3.9.11-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled and non-default settings for GitHub Connect configured, an attacker could use an enterprise GitHub Actions download token to fetch private repository data. This token is only accessible to users on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To fix this vulnerability, the Actions download token will now be a permissionless token. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-1908](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-1908) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.11: Bug fixes](#3.9.11-bugs)

* Redundant messages caused increased log volumes in `/var/log/syslog`.
### [3.9.11: Known issues](#3.9.11-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs.

* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
## Enterprise Server 3.9.8

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.8](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.8/download)

January 16, 2024

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.8-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.8: Security fixes](#3.9.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges through a command injection vulnerability in the Management Console. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0507](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0507) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: An attacker could leverage an unsafe reflection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) that could lead to reflection injection. This vulnerability could lead to the execution of user-controlled methods and remote code execution. To exploit this bug, an actor would need to be logged into an account on the GHES instance with the [organization owner role](/en/enterprise-server%403.13/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners). GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2024-0200](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-0200) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.8: Bug fixes](#3.9.8-bugs)

* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server using GitHub CLI OAuth App with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* During periods of high load, users would see intermittent interruptions to services when upstream services failed internal health checks.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Deleting a repository would enqueue unnecessary background jobs that would never complete.
* When creating a new custom pattern for secret scanning, the "More options" section of the custom pattern form automatically collapsed when a user entered an invalid regex in the post processing expressions (before/after secret match or additional secret requirements).
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users could experience a `500` error when viewing a secret scanning alert page in cases where the alerted commits belonged to the user and one or more commits could not be found.
* Members of an enterprise were incorrectly allowed access to the REST API endpoints for Enterprise licensing.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 to 3.9 could result in user login failures due to an outdated gem dependency.
### [3.9.8: Changes](#3.9.8-changes)

* To avoid leaking secrets, the logging of all parameters is disabled for Management Console events in enterprise audit logs.
* More detailed information is logged when a GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade failed due to missing database encryption keys.
* The branch protection setting to require PR approval of the most recent reviewable push is included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
### [3.9.8: Known issues](#3.9.8-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower
  .
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.9.8: Errata](#3.9.8-errata)

* These release notes previously indicated that GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.8 contained fixes for the following issues:

  + An improper authentication vulnerability that affected private mode, [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847)
  + An incorrect authorization vulnerability that affected issue comments, [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380)

  These fixes were included in GitHub Enterprise Server [3.9.7](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/release-notes#3.9.7-security-fixes).
## Enterprise Server 3.9.7

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.7](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.7/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.7-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.7: Security fixes](#3.9.7-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper authentication vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a bypass of private mode by using a specially crafted API request. Private mode is the mechanism that enforces authentication for publicly-scoped resources. For more information, see "[Enabling private mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/enabling-private-mode)."

  This vulnerability would allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to various types of resources set as public on the instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need network access to the GitHub Enterprise Server instance configured in private mode. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-6847](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6847).
* **HIGH**: An attacker with access to a Management Console user account with the editor role could escalate privileges by making requests to the endpoint used for bootstrapping the instance, and then reset the root site administrator password. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46647](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46647) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an insufficient entropy vulnerability, an attacker could brute force a user invitation to the Management Console. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed knowledge that a user invitation was pending. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46648](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46648).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access via a race condition when an organization was converted from a user. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46649](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46649) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An attacker could maintain admin access to a transferred repository in a race condition by making a GraphQL mutation to alter repository permissions during the transfer. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6690](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6690) for this vulnerability, which reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file in the audit log in GitHub Enterprise Server was identified that that could allow an attacker to gain access to the Management Console. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6802) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: A race condition in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed an outside collaborator to be added while a repository is being transferred. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6803](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6803) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: Improper privilege management allowed arbitrary workflows to be committed and run using an improperly scoped PAT. To exploit this, a workflow must have already existed in the target repo. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6804](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-6804) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** Pre-receive hooks have been further hardened against shell command injections.
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.7: Bug fixes](#3.9.7-bugs)

* In rare cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, a failed check on a deleted repository could cause upgrades to a new version of GitHub Enterprise Server to fail.
* Threads in the Git proxy service `babeld` could crash while reading Git packet lines.
* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, site administrators using the `ghe-config-apply` utility may have seen the extraneous message "Error: Server closed the connection" in the logs for the utility.
* Some OAuth applications did not have device code flow (DCF) explicitly enabled, which prevented DCF from running correctly.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, some maintenance tasks could fail due to incomplete upgrade steps during previous upgrades to new releases of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* Support for authenticating to GitHub Enterprise Server from Visual Studio Code with a device code was unintentionally disabled.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* In some cases, when an administrator uploaded a custom TLS certificate, the certificate was not correctly installed on the instance.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role could not update custom links for push protection using the REST API.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, some security products were not automatically enabled for new public repositories.
* Deprecated `resource_activity` jobs were not processed and accumulated over time in the queue, causing possible memory issues.
* Pull request review threads at the file level, rather than the individual line level, were not included in exports from `ghe-migrator` or the Organization Migrations API.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* After a user started a repository transfer, if another user viewed the repository before the transfer finished, the repository overview rendered incorrectly.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect and unified search enabled, users trying to view the unified search code results would get a 500 error.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, users occasionally got a 500 error when viewing a job with a pending deployment.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, an issue with `GH_TOKEN` sometimes prevented GitHub Pages sites from building successfully in workflows.
* An administrator could enable GitHub Connect on an instance with a license that does not support GitHub Connect.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* The enterprise account pages on some installations rendered very slowly.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* When using `ghe-migrator` to import repositories into GitHub Enterprise Server, the `conflicts` and `audit` subcommands produced an invalid CSV file due to an extra log line appended to the file.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* Running `ghe-spokesctl gov info` without any arguments caused a `panic` response.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, webhooks for alert locations did not contain information about push protection bypasses.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, code scanning would report an incorrect number of files scanned on the "Tools" status page.
### [3.9.7: Changes](#3.9.7-changes)

* On an instance with Dependabot updates enabled, Dependabot relies on the node installation provided by the actions runner instead of dynamically downloading.
* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* To avoid negative effects on disk utilization, `babeld` log files have a maximum size of 15 GB.
* Instance administrators can manage search indices for GitHub Discussions from the site admin dashboard.
* To improve reliability of release uploads in low-bandwidth environments, the time-to-live (TTL) value of the token for uploading release assets has increased from 1 hour to 3 hours.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* The audit log now tracks all failed password attempts individually. Previously, duplicate failed password attempts in sequence within the same day would be grouped into one failed password attempt, with a `count` field.
### [3.9.7: Known issues](#3.9.7-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)."
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The `HAProxy` version has been updated in this release. You may encounter elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.7 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.9.6 or lower

### [3.9.7: Deprecations](#3.9.7-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.
## Enterprise Server 3.9.6

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.6](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.6/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.6-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.6: Security fixes](#3.9.6-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.6: Bug fixes](#3.9.6-bugs)

* The REST API did not correctly check the "Users can create organizations" setting. [Updated: 2024-05-30]
* The `ghe-cluster-repl-status` command did not display all replication statuses.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability enabled, `ghe-config-apply` timed out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* `SpokesRepairRepoReplicaJob` and `SpokesSyncCacheReplicaJob` jobs failed, causing cache server replicas to not update and potentially prolonging replication issues.
* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when managing maintenance mode using `ghe-cluster-maintenance`, an erroneous warning appeared that read "Warning: Maintenance mode set on primary, please make sure to set it on any active replica if needed". - |
  `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On instances using the private beta of SCIM provisioning, some users were presented with a "single sign-in" hover card.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, administrators received a `500` error after attempting to force cancel a workflow run via Staff Tools.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, repositories within organizations created using the `+` dropdown menu did not have GitHub Advanced Security features enabled automatically, even if the features should have been enabled.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.9.6: Changes](#3.9.6-changes)

* Instructions in the "Migrations" section of the Management Console clarify that only standard AWS S3 endpoints are supported when configuring AWS S3 as a blob storage provider for migrations.
* When running async repository repairs, the output message about scheduling a repair job is more accurate.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
### [3.9.6: Known issues](#3.9.6-known-issues)

* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes.
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary.
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2024-02-22]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

### [3.9.5: Security fixes](#3.9.5-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.9.5: Bug fixes](#3.9.5-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alerts could fail to show an error message in the UI when a failure occurred closing or reopening the alert.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, when token location(s) included a commit that introduced a large change, the page for viewing the alert would load slowly.
* In some cases, users could reopen a pull request that should not have been able to be reopened.
* When running the `ghe-saml-mapping-csv` CLI command in dry run mode, the operation failed with errors.
* When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
* On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
* When viewing fine-grained personal access tokens, the permissions text for pre-receive hooks was not visible for selection when filtering by permission.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.

### [3.9.5: Changes](#3.9.5-changes)

* When listing the node metadata for all nodes using the [Manage GitHub Enterprise Server REST API](/en/enterprise-server/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-all-ghes-node-metadata-for-all-nodes), information about whether a given node is a replica is included.
* When GitHub Enterprise checks for a new upgrade or hotpatch package, if the check fails the failure details are output to the `ghe-update-check` log, and the Management Console UI provides a "Check Again" button to rerun the check.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
* When running async repository repairs, the output message about scheduling a repair job is more accurate.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.4-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.4: Security fixes](#3.9.4-security-fixes)

* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]

### [3.9.4: Bug fixes](#3.9.4-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, scale sets configured at the enterprise level did not appear for use within the instance's organizations or repositories.
* When an administrator tried to validate blob storage connection settings for GitHub Enterprise Importer in the Management Console using the **Test storage settings** button, the operation failed.
* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* In some cases, when starting a new GitHub Enterprise Server instance, the preflight page indicated that there was no user disk of sufficient size attached.
* When running the ghe-migrator, certain error messages contained an invalid link to import documentation.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, due to mismatched values, users could not easily associate workflow job run IDs from the GitHub Enterprise Server APIs or webhooks with a job in the UI. Workflow job runs now use a new URL pattern of `...actions/runs/job/{job_id}`, and `job_id` matches values from APIs and webhook payloads.
* Administrators could not see or use the "Migrations" section in an instance's Management Console, which prevented the configuration of blob storage for GitHub Enterprise Importer. [Updated: 2023-08-31]

## Enterprise Server 3.9.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.3/download)

August 10, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.3-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.3: Security fixes](#3.9.3-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
### [3.9.3: Bug fixes](#3.9.3-bugs)

* API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query.
* The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role could not upload the social preview image of a repository.
* The security settings page for a repository would return an error when enterprise-level runners were assigned to the repository.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.9.3: Changes](#3.9.3-changes)

* On GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and above, a blob storage provider must be configured in the Management Console in order to use the GitHub Enterprise Importer CLI, "startRepositoryMigration" GraphQL API, or "Start an organization migration" REST API. The "Migrations" section in the Management Console was mistakenly removed and has been added back.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.9.3: Known issues](#3.9.3-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)." [Updated: 2023-02-23]
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* Administrators cannot set or update the instance's blob storage settings in the Management Console using the "Migrations" settings tab. No matter what values an administrator provides, the following error message will appear: `Unable to connect to migrations provider. Please check the form and try again.` [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.9.2/download)

July 28, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.2-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

The known issues originally published on 2023-07-28 omitted a number of known issues that still existed. The `Known issues` section below was updated on 2023-08-08.

### [3.9.2: Changes](#3.9.2-changes)

* Added a pre-upgrade check to validate the GHES version and MySQL configuration before allowing an upgrade to 3.9.
* Adjusted the timeout threshold for shutting down MySQL to prevent premature termination when upgrading to GHES 3.9.
### [3.9.2: Known issues](#3.9.2-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted. Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.

* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* The "Migrations" section is missing from the Management Console, so it isn't possible to enable, disable, or reconfigure blob storage credentials for migrations. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

  + Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
  + Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.9.18) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.1-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

The known issues originally published on 2023-07-18 omitted a number of known issues that still existed. The `Known issues` section below was updated on 2023-08-08.

### [3.9.1: Security fixes](#3.9.1-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.9.1: Bug fixes](#3.9.1-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* When a user viewed a Jupyter notebook, GitHub Enterprise Server returned a `500` error code if the instance was configured with a self-signed TLS certificate.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* `.topojson` files would not render correctly, but files that conformed to the TopoJSON spec that used a `.geojson` extension would render correctly.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* REST API endpoints for managing GitHub Enterprise Server are now functional. For more information, see "[Manage GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
* After creation of a new Management Console user, the Management Console did not display the button to copy the new users invitation.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* In some cases, pull requests with more than 25 rich-diff renderable files required that users toggle the diff type to correctly render the files over the 25-file limit.
* In rare circumstances, Git commits signed with SSH keys using the RSA algorithm would incorrectly indicate the signature was invalid.
* After a migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer, some repository autolink references were created with an incorrect format.
* In some cases on an instance without a GitHub Advanced Security license, Redis exceeded the maximum default memory allocation, causing `500` errors for the instance's users.
* On an instance with many organizations, the enterprise security overview page returned a `500` error.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Users were unable to configure a SSH certificate authority for an organization.
* An erroneous "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link was visible in site admin pages for organizations.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a GitHub Advanced Security license, repository-level runner scale sets were not accounted for when determining whether default setup for code scanning could be used.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, a committer would not receive an email notification for a secret scanning alert where push protections were bypassed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user filtered by a custom pattern on an organizations "Code & security analysis" page using an invalid query, the entire GitHub Advanced Security disappeared and an error reading "Sorry, something went wrong loading GitHub Advanced Security settings" appeared.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user browsed to the alerts page for secret scanning without signing in, the instance responded with a `500` error.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, links to `http(s)://HOSTNAME/features/actions` from the web UI returned a `500` error.
* If a user added a new item to a projects roadmap view, and the item was outside of the viewport, the view would crash and display "This project failed to load".
* The audit log reported the incorrect target repository for pre-receive hook failures.
* Users can add issues and pull requests from any organization to a project, and are no longer limited to the user or organization of the project.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a GitHub Advanced Security license, enterprise-level runner scale sets with the `code-scanning` label were not sufficient to allow default setup for code scanning.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ERROR`-level "resolver failed" errors no longer appear in system logs when the instance is unable to resolve an offline fileserver. The messages are now `DEBUG`-level.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
* Code Scanning workflow runs now only request the `code-scanning` label so that they can be used with runner scale sets.
### [3.9.1: Changes](#3.9.1-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* During initialization of a cluster configuration, output from the `ghe-cluster-config-init` command-line utility is improved and simplified.
* The API endpoint for management of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance was unavailable prior to initial configuration of the instance.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, internal tooling to repair repositories now attempts to resolve problems within the entire repository network.
* To supplement a disaster recovery plan for a GitHub Enterprise Server instance in a cluster configuration, an administrator can configure a replica of an entire cluster in a separate datacenter, allowing the cluster to fail over to redundant nodes. For more information, see "[Configuring high availability replication for a cluster](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/configuring-high-availability-replication-for-a-cluster)."
### [3.9.1: Known issues](#3.9.1-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* When enabling CodeQL via default setup [at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale), some checks related to GitHub Actions are omitted, potentially preventing the process from completing.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* The "Migrations" section is missing from the Management Console, so it isn't possible to enable, disable, or reconfigure blob storage credentials for migrations. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

  + Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
  + Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

  [Updated: 2023-09-05]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes. [Updated: 2023-09-21]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, ephemeral self-hosted runners do not automatically update to the latest version. Users will need to manually update the runners to the latest version. [Updated: 2023-09-29]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-10]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

**Warning**: A change to MySQL in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later may impact the performance of your instance. Before you upgrade, make sure you've read the "[Known issues](#3.9.0-known-issues)" section of these release notes.

### [3.9.0: Features](#3.9.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + To improve security posture and protect data from threats, enterprise owners can see user activity from the Management Console within the enterprise audit log, including events from the UI, API, and administrative SSH access. For more information, see "[Audit log events for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#management_console-category-actions)."
  + During an upgrade of an instance to a new release, people with administrative SSH access to the instance can monitor the progress of routine migrations using the `ghe-migrations` utility. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-migrations)."
  + On an instance with multiple nodes, site administrators can use the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API to monitor the health of replication. For more information, see "[Monitoring a high-availability configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/monitoring-a-high-availability-configuration)."
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can ensure a balanced distribution of jobs across nodes by using the `ghe-cluster-rebalance` utility. For more information, see "[Rebalancing cluster workloads](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering/rebalancing-cluster-workloads)."
  + On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can proactively monitor the health of individual nodes and control the reintroduction of unhealthy nodes into the cluster using Node Eligibility Service. For more information, see "[Monitoring the health of your cluster nodes with Node Eligibility Service](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-clustering/monitoring-the-health-of-your-cluster-nodes-with-node-eligibility-service)."
* #### [Identity and access management](#identity-and-access-management)

  + On an instance configured for SAML SSO, enterprise owners can review information about the Identity Provider (IdP) configured for user authentication using the GraphQL API. The personal access token (PAT) used to authenticate requests to this API requires the `read:enterprise` scope. Previously, the PAT required the `admin:enterprise` scope. For more information, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/graphql/reference/objects#enterpriseidentityprovider)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + For an instance or organization with 2FA enabled, users can configure a 2FA method to be a preferred method. Users can also update 2FA methods from `http(s)://HOSTNAME/settings/security`. For more information, see "[Configuring two-factor authentication](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)" and "[Changing your two-factor authentication method](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/changing-your-preferred-two-factor-authentication-method)."
* #### [REST API](#rest-api)

  + To provide API integrators a smooth migration path and time to update integrations after GitHub makes occasional breaking changes, the REST API now uses calendar-based versioning. GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 provides version `2022-11-28` of the REST API. For more information, see "[API Versions](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/overview/api-versions?apiVersion=2022-11-28)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Connect](#github-connect)

  + Enterprise owners who configure Server Statistics on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled will transmit usage metrics related to GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[About Server Statistics](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/analyzing-how-your-team-works-with-server-statistics/about-server-statistics#server-statistics-data-collected)."
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + To more easily discover potential security or quality issues in code, users can configure code scanning directly through the web interface without adding a GitHub Actions workflow to the repository. This feature finds and sets up the best CodeQL configuration for the repository, detecting supported languages and enabling CodeQL analysis for every pull request and every push to the default branch and any protected branches. Analysis of JavaScript (including TypeScript), Python, and Ruby code, are currently supported. For more information, see "[Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically)."
  + To simplify the configuration of code scanning, organization owners can enable code scanning for all eligible repositories in an organization using a default configuration, either via the web interface or REST API. For more information, see "[Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-at-scale)" and "[REST API endpoints for organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
  + To ensure that relevant alerts remain visible and actionable, users can manually remove stale alerts from code scanning. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#removing-stale-configurations-and-alerts-from-a-branch)."
  + To better understand the status of CodeQL and other code scanning tools for a repository, and to help troubleshoot, users can review the tool status page. For more information, see "[About the tool status page for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page)."
  + To customize the behavior of code scanning on a per-repository basis, repository administrators can configure what severity levels for code scanning alerts will cause checks in a pull request to fail. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests#code-scanning-results-check-failures)."
  + To protect repositories from pushes that contain custom secret scanning patterns defined at the enterprise, organization, or repository level, users can enable push protection for those patterns. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + Organization owners can view the enablement status of security features for the organization's repositories using the REST API. The endpoint provides details for GitHub Advanced Security, secret scanning, and push protection. For more information, see "[Repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-organization-repositories)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Repository administrators can programmatically enable code scanning with a default CodeQL configuration using the REST API. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Configuring default setup for code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically)"
    - "[Get the code scanning default setup configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/code-scanning#get-a-code-scanning-default-setup-configuration)" in the Code Scanning REST API documentation
    - "[Update the code scanning default setup configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/code-scanning#update-a-code-scanning-default-setup-configuration)" in the Code Scanning REST API documentation
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + To improve the security of GitHub Actions workflows that pin references, Dependabot can update the versioning for calls to reusable workflows within workflow files. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)."
  + On an instance with GitHub Actions and the dependency graph enabled, as well as automatic access to GitHub.com actions using GitHub Connect, the web interface will suggest submission actions within a repository with supported languages. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)"
    - "[About GitHub Actions for enterprises](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/about-github-actions-for-enterprises)"
    - "[Enabling automatic access to GitHub.com actions using GitHub Connect](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect)"

    For repositories that use a language that has a submission action, when users with write access visit their dependency graph (this page), we will show them a prompt that directs them to the Marketplace to find an action that would help them.
  + To improve the security of projects that use npm v9, the dependency graph and Dependabot can parse and update `package-lock.json` files that specify `lockfileVersion: 3`. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)," "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)," and [`lockfileVersion`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json#lockfileversion) in the npm documentation.
  + To improve the security of Gradle projects, the dependency graph and Dependabot can parse and update Gradle version catalogs in `settings.gradle`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and [Sharing dependency versions between projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) in the Gradle User Manual.
  + To ensure that users receive the most relevant and actionable alerts about dependency updates, repository administrators and organization owners can enable or disable Dependabot alerts for an individual repository or organization. For more information, see "[Quickstart for securing your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository#managing-dependabot-alerts)" or "[Quickstart for securing your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-organization#managing-dependabot-alerts-and-the-dependency-graph)."
  + If people with access to a repository do not interact with Dependabot security updates for over 90 days, Dependabot will pause automated pull request activity. For more information, see "[About Dependabot security updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-automatic-deactivation-of-dependabot-updates)."
  + To help users evaluate the stability risk of a dependency update, Dependabot can fetch release notes, changelogs, and commit history in pull requests that update Docker dependencies. For more information, see "[Configuration options for the dependabot.yml file](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#docker)."
  + To assist with software security and supply chain risk management, people with read access to a repository can export a software bill of materials (SBOM) for a repository's dependency graph using the web interface or REST API. The SBOM adheres to the SPDX 2.3 specification. For more information, see "[Using the dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api#generating-and-submitting-a-software-bill-of-materials-sbom)," "[Exporting a software bill of materials for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository)," and [The Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®) Specification Version 2.3](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/) on the SPDX website.
  + The dependency graph can parse Python dependencies for `pyproject.toml` files that follow the PEP 621 standard. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)" and [PEP 621 – Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) in the Index of Python Enhancement Proposals.
  + Users can use the GraphQL API to review dependencies submitted using the dependency submission API. For more information, see "[Schema previews](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/graphql/overview/schema-previews#access-to-a-repositorys-dependency-graph-preview)."
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + For self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on this GitHub Enterprise Server release, the minimum required version of the GitHub Actions Runner application is 2.303.0. See the release notes for this version in the [`actions/runner` repository](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.303.0) on GitHub.com. If your instance uses ephemeral self-hosted runners and you've disabled automatic updates, you must upgrade your runners to this version of the Runner application before upgrading your instance to this GitHub Enterprise Server release. [Updated: 2024-04-25]
  + On instances in a cluster configuration, GitHub Actions is available as a private beta. Beta features are subject to change. For more information, and to enroll in the beta, [contact your representative on GitHub's Sales team](https://github.com/enterprise/contact).
  + Administrators of self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions can configure auto-scaling runners using Actions Runner Controller and runner scale sets. For more information, see "[About Actions Runner Controller](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/about-actions-runner-controller)."
  + Administrators can bypass all protection rules for a given environment and force the pending jobs referencing the environment to proceed. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#allow-administrators-to-bypass-configured-protection-rules)."
  + Users who deploy with OIDC can define more advanced access policies by including additional custom claims within a token. To help uniquely verify the source of a workflow job, include the following claims.

    - `actor_id`
    - `repository_id`
    - `repository_owner_id`
    - `workflow_ref`
    - `workflow_sha`
    - `job_workflow_sha`

    For more information, see [Security hardening your deployments](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments).
  + To improve security for workflows that use `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the following defaults apply to new organizations and repositories.

    - New organizations that users create inherit permissions from the instance's enterprise-level configuration. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions)."
    - New repositories that users create within an organization inherit permissions from the organization. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions)."
    - New user-owned repositories have a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN`. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions)."
  + To allow workflow authors to pin a required workflow file to a fully validated version, required workflows can be referenced using any branch, tag, or commit SHA from the repository containing the workflow file. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-a-required-workflow-for-your-organization)."
  + To enforce required workflows throughout an organization, GitHub Enterprise Server blocks direct pushes to branches where required workflows are enforced. To allow direct pushes for a particular repository, remove the repository as a target for the required workflow. For more information, see "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#configuring-a-required-workflow-for-your-organization)."

### [3.9.0: Changes](#3.9.0-changes)

* Field names and destinations for some service logs on GitHub Enterprise Server have changed. If any tooling or processes in your environment rely on specific field names within logs, or log entries in specific files, the following changes may affect you.

  + `level` is now `SeverityText`.
  + `log_message`, `msg`, or `message` is now `Body`.
  + `now` is now `Timestamp`.
  + Custom field names such as `gh.repo.id` or `graphql.operation.name` use semantic names.
  + Log statements that the instance would previously write to `auth.log`, `ldap.log`, or `ldap-sync.log` now appear in containerized logs for `github-unicorn` if the statement originated from a web request, or in logs for `github-resqued` if the statement originated from a background job. For more information about containerized logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-appliance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)."

  For a full list of field mappings, download the [OpenTelemetry attribute mapping CSV](/assets/ghes-3.9-opentelemetry-attribute-mappings.csv). This change is part of GitHub's gradual migration to internal semantic conventions for [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), and additional field names will change in upcoming releases.
* On a configured instance, the name for the HAProxy service is now `haproxy-frontend`. Previously, the name was `haproxy`. Additionally, on an unconfigured instance, there is a new service named `haproxy-pre-config`. If your instance forwards logs to an external system, update your rules to reflect these changes. For more information, see "[Log forwarding](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/exploring-user-activity/log-forwarding)" article
* For an instance or organization with 2FA enabled, when a user sets up 2FA, GitHub Enterprise Server suggests an authenticator app (TOTP) by default.
* When a person with administrative SSH access to an instance submits a support bundle using either the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utility, a period for log collection specified with the `-p` or `--period` no longer requires quotes to enclose the date value. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-support-bundle)."
* To provide additional context within the web interface on an instance where Dependabot alerts are enabled, links to Dependabot alerts in an issue or pull request comment display an improved label and hovercard with alert details.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, people with write or maintain access to a repository can view or act on Dependabot alerts by default. Custom roles, the security manager role, organization permissions, and notification settings are not affected.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and GitHub Connect enabled for the synchronization of actions from GitHub.com, CodeQL code scanning is up to 16% faster. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning for your appliance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-github-connect-to-sync-github-actions)."
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and email configured for notifications, users can receive notifications for secret scanning alerts by watching a repository and choosing "All activity" or "Security alerts". To continue receiving notifications for secret scanning alerts in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9 and later, users must enable email notifications in the web interface at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/settings/notifications` under "Watching" by choosing "Email".
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, secret scanning alerts display whether detected tokens from GitHub are valid.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, the enterprise and organization audit logs now display an event when an owner enables or disables a push protection for a custom pattern for a repository, organization, or the enterprise. For more information, see "[Reviewing the audit log for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#org-category-actions)" and "[Audit log events for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise#business_secret_scanning_push_protection-category-actions)."
* Users can filter the lists of alerts for Dependabot, code scanning, and secret scanning by repository topic or team in the security overview for an organization. For more information, see "[Filtering alerts in security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/security-overview/filtering-alerts-in-security-overview)."
* In the security overview for an organization, the following improvements apply to the "Security coverage" view during feature enablement.

  + To provide insight into the number of GitHub Advanced Security licenses used, active committers for the repository are visible. For repositories where GitHub Advanced Security is not enabled, the number indicates the number of licenses required to enable the feature.
  + Unsaved changes are now labeled with a "Modified" tag, and the "Save security settings" button now displays the total number of changes to save.
  + While a security feature is being enabled, the "Security coverage" view shows a status of "Updating..." to inform you of the ongoing process.

  For more information, see "[About security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/security-overview/about-security-overview)."
* In the security overview's "Security risk" and "Security coverage" views, when a user selects a team from the "Team" drop-down or filters by team, results appear for repositories where the team has write or administrative access or has been granted access to security alerts. Previously, users could only view results for repositories where the team had administrative access or had been granted access to security alerts.
* To provide more context within a project, users can share a deep link to a specific issue in a project to have the issue open in the project's side panel.
* Organization owners can create up to five custom repository roles. Previously, the limit was three. For more information, see "[About custom repository roles](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/about-custom-repository-roles)."
* When transferring a repository, users can also rename the repository. For more information, see "[Transferring a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)."
* If a user archives a repository, responses from the GraphQL API that include information about the repository now include an `archivedAt` value with a timestamp representing the archival date.
### [3.9.0: Backups](#3.9.0-backups)

* Before beginning a backup with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 and later, the `ghe-host-check` utility will now perform a preflight check on the backup host to confirm the software version and disk space requirements. For more information, see the [3.9.0 release](https://github.com/github/backup-utils/releases/tag/v3.9.0) in the `github/backup-utils` repository on GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.0 allows administrators to view the progress of backup and restoration operations on the backup host using the `ghe-backup-progress` utility. For more information, see "[Configuring backups on your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance#monitoring-backup-or-restoration-progress)."
### [3.9.0: Known issues](#3.9.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9 or 3.10, I/O utilization will increase, and in some cases the instance's performance will be impacted.
  Reduced performance is due to the database server being upgraded from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0.
  For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance)."
* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 and later, the requirements for TLS security levels have changed due to an upgrade to containers in the underlying OS. After upgrading from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and a custom TLS certificate, users may experience disruptions with workflow runs if the TLS certificate uses weak encryption. Workflow runs will not trigger, and the following error message will appear in system logs for `babeld`.

  ```
  CA certificate key too weak

  ```

  To resolve this issue, confirm that your certificate complies
  with level 2 of the OpenSSL security specification. For more information, see [SSL\_CTX\_set\_security\_level](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.html#DEFAULT-CALLBACK-BEHAVIOUR) in the OpenSSL docs. For more information about reviewing your instance's logs, see "[About system logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/about-system-logs#system-logs-in-the-systemd-journal)".

  If the error appears in `babeld` logs because your TLS certificate does not comply with level 2 of the specification, you must create and upload a new certificate with stronger security before you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10 or later. For more information, see "[Configuring TLS](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/hardening-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-tls)." [Updated: 2023-10-26]
* The Management Console may get stuck in a loop showing "Checking requirements..." when attempting to download an update. It is safe to proceed the update process manually via the command line.
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, 3.8.0, or 3.9.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.9.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* After upgrading an existing instance to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API is unavailable. To enable the API, SSH into the instance and run the following commands.

  Shell
  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo chown -R ghes-manage-gateway:ghes-manage-gateway /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo systemctl restart ghes-manage-gateway ghes-manage-gateway-consul

  ```
  ```
  sudo mkdir -p /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo chown -R ghes-manage-gateway:ghes-manage-gateway /data/ghes-manage-gateway/current
  sudo systemctl restart ghes-manage-gateway ghes-manage-gateway-consul

  ```

  For more information about the Manage GitHub Enterprise Server API, see "[Manage GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/rest/enterprise-admin/manage-ghes?apiVersion=2022-11-28)." [Updated: 2023-06-22]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, after you upgrade nodes other than the primary MySQL node and before you upgrade the primary MySQL node, the following output may appear multiple times after you run `ghe-config-apply`.

  ```
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete IMAGE_ID (cannot be forced) - image is being used by running container CONTAINER_ID

  ```

  You can safely ignore this message.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* The `mbind: Operation not permitted` error in the `/var/log/mysql/mysql.err` file can be ignored. MySQL 8 does not gracefully handle when the `CAP_SYS_NICE` capability isn't required, and outputs an error instead of a warning.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account will not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, Mermaid diagrams in the web UI display an "Unable to render rich display" error and fail to render. [Updated: 2023-08-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if shared runner groups are configured for the enterprise, the enterprise security overview page may return a `500` error. You can avoid the issue by trying one of the following workarounds.

  + Add a runner scale set to the enterprise runner group shared with the repositories.
  + Remove access to the enterprise runner group from the affected repositories or organizations.

  [Updated: 2023-09-05]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration with high availability configured, `ghe-config-apply` times out while waiting for `hookshot-go` to start on replica application nodes. [Updated: 2023-09-21]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, ephemeral self-hosted runners do not automatically update to the latest version. Users will need to manually update the runners to the latest version. [Updated: 2023-09-29]
* Jobs in a deprecated queue are not processed and may accumulate over time. These jobs are reflected in the monitor dashboard's "Aqueduct queue depth" graph as an increase in `resource_activity`. In some cases, a buildup of unprocessed jobs can result in memory exhaustion. If you observe memory exhaustion on your instance and see a high metric for `resource_activity`, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-10-10]
* When an administrator uses the `-p` flag with the `ghe-support-bundle` utility to collect data for a specific number of hours, the utility erroneously collects more logs than necessary. [Updated: 2023-10-13]
* The settings for enabling scheduled reminders were added unintentionally to this release. Scheduled reminders are not officially supported. [Updated: 2023-10-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, after an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 or earlier, an internal exception could prevent successful completion of some operations, like upgrades or the configuration of new replica nodes for high availability. If this issue occurs, administrators may see the following error in `/data/user/common/ghe-config.log`.

  ```
  Error occurred while executing servicing step 'Clone datatier login to secondary replica' for component CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins during CopyAvailabilityGroupSqlLogins: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

  ```

  To resolve this issue, upgrade to the latest patch release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-12-04]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
* During periods of high traffic, interruptions in service may occur due to insufficient resource allocations for internal components. [Updated 2024-01-23]
* Redundant messages may cause an increase in the volume of events logged in `/var/log/syslog`. [Updated: 2024-03-08]
* If a hotpatch upgrade requires the `haproxy-frontend` service to be restarted, the restart will hang if there are existing long-lived connections, such as browser web sockets or Git operations. No new connections will be accepted for up to 5 minutes. Any existing unfinished connections at this time will be disconnected. [Updated: 2024-06-17]
### [3.9.0: Deprecations](#3.9.0-deprecations)

* #### [Change to command-line utility for management of replication](#change-to-command-line-utility-for-management-of-replication)

  + On an instance with multiple nodes, people with administrative SSH access to the instance should use `ghe-spokesctl` for management of Git replication instead of `ghe-spokes`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-spokesctl)."
* #### [Dependency graph no longer ingests go.sum files](#dependency-graph-no-longer-ingests-gosum-files)

  + Because `go.sum` files are not lock files and may result in false positive Dependabot alerts, on an instance with the dependency graph enabled, the `go.sum` files are no longer ingested for users' Go repositories. If Dependabot alerts are enabled, Dependabot will no longer alert users for vulnerabilities in a `go.sum` file's dependencies. The dependency graph continues to support `go.mod` files, the recommended format for Go projects. Use Go 1.17 or higher to ensure your `go.mod` file contains a comprehensive view of all direct and transitive dependencies. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."
* #### [Only GitHub Actions can publish a GitHub Pages site if source includes symbolic links](#only-github-actions-can-publish-a-github-pages-site-if-source-includes-symbolic-links)

  + To improve the security of an instance where users deploy sites using GitHub Pages, sites that contain symbolic links will no longer build outside of GitHub Actions. If a user's site is affected and a site administrator has configured email for the instance, the user will receive an email with instructions about how to fix the error. To continue using symbolic links in the site's source, the instance must be configured for GitHub Actions, and the user must write a GitHub Actions workflow to use as a publishing source. For more information, see "[About GitHub Pages](/en/enterprise-server%403.9/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)."
### [3.9.0: Errata](#3.9.0-errata)

* Previously, these release notes indiciated that organization owners could enable the display of organization members' IP addresses in audit log events. Audit logs for GitHub Enterprise Server always include IP addresses. [Updated: 2024-03-28]

## Enterprise Server 3.7.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.19/download)

December 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.19: Security fixes](#3.7.19-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed arbitrary file reading when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com/) program and assigned [CVE-2023-46645](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2023-46645).
* **MEDIUM**: An insertion of sensitive information into log file vulnerability was identified in the log files for a GitHub Enterprise Server backend service that could permit an adversary in the middle attack when combined with other phishing techniques. To exploit this, an attacker would need access to the log files for the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, a backup archive created with GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities, or a service which received streamed logs. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-6746](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6746) for this vulnerability.
* **MEDIUM**: Due to an improper access control, an attacker could view private repository names by enumerating check run IDs with the "Get a check run" API endpoint. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content other than the name. GitHub has requested CVE ID [CVE-2023-46646](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46646) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be updated with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability did not allow unauthorized access to any repository content as it also required `contents.write` and `issues.read` permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51379](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51379).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified that allowed issue comments to be read with an improperly scoped token. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-51380](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51380).
* **LOW:** To render interactive maps in an instance's web UI using Azure Maps, GitHub Enterprise Server has migrated from use of an unsecure Azure Maps API token to a more secure access token provided by role-based access control (RBAC) in Entra ID. After upgrading to this release, to re-enable interactive maps, an administrator must reconfigure authentication to Azure Maps in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)."
* To address scenarios that could lead to denial of service, HAProxy has been upgraded to version 2.8.4. [Updated 2024-01-03]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.19: Bug fixes](#3.7.19-bugs)

* When an administrator ran the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` command, the `-p` flag did not produce bundles with log durations as specified. The duration period can now only be specified in `days`. Additionally, unnecessary files were sanitized by the commands.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, upgrades could fail due to a background job running during database migration.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, the `ghe-repl-teardown` command failed when provided with a UUID.
* In some environments, stale `.backup` log files could accumulate in the system.
* On an instance hosted on AWS, when configuring GitHub Packages, virtual-hosted-style AWS S3 URLs would default to path-style URLs if a `region-code` was included. For more information, see [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.
* Because the `|` character was not permitted, administrators could not add an SMTP username to authenticate with the Azure Communication Service.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, site administrators using the `ghe-secret-scanning` command would not see a relevant error message if their input was invalid.
* After importing a migration archive using `ghe-migrator` or REST API endpoints for organization migrations, in some cases, some review comments within pull requests were not associated with lines of code.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning alert emails were sent to organization owners even if their email address did not comply with domain restrictions.
* A missing executable on the PATH caused the `ghe-spokesctl ssh` command to fail.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, some system users were incorrectly counted as consuming a license following license sync.
* A user in the process of being converted into an organization could be added as a collaborator on a repository. This resulted in the new organizations owners unexpectedly receiving access to the repository.
* Pre-receive hook failures were not visible in the administrator audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.7.19: Changes](#3.7.19-changes)

* When adding a node to an instance, performance is improved during initial database replication.
* An administrator can run the new `ghe-check-background-upgrade-jobs` command to ensure all upgrade jobs that run in the background have finished. This allows the administrator to know when they can start the next upgrade to their GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
* When using `ghe-migrator prepare` to import an archive, a missing `schema.json` file results in an `UnsupportedArchive` error rather than an `UnsupportedSchemaVersion` error.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.7.19: Known issues](#3.7.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance.
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.
* Restoring backups with `ghe-restore` on a GHES cluster will exit prematurely if `redis` has not restarted properly.
* The upgrade of `HAProxy` to version `2.8.4` (to address scenarios that could
  lead to denial of service) is causing elevated error rates when HAProxy
  is upgraded as part of a hotpatch upgrade to a GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
  These elevated error rates should resolve within 5 minutes of the hotpatch being applied.

  Please note, when performing a hotpatch upgrade to
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.7.19 or higher
  you will encounter this known issue only if you are hotpatching from
  GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.7.18 or lower
  . [Updated 2024-01-03]
### [3.7.19: Deprecations](#3.7.19-deprecations)

* #### [Interactive maps in the web UI no longer allow authentication using an Azure Maps API key](#interactive-maps-in-the-web-ui-no-longer-allow-authentication-using-an-azure-maps-api-key)

  + To allow users to render interactive maps in an instance's web UI by writing GeoJSON or TopoJSON syntax, GitHub Enterprise Server previously required a potentially unsecure API key for authentication with Azure Maps. If an administrator previously enabled interactive maps on an instance, the feature is disabled upon upgrade to this release.

    To re-enable interactive maps for your instance, you must configure an application on an Entra ID tenant that has access to Azure Maps using role-based access control (RBAC). For more information, see "[Configuring interactive maps](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-user-applications-for-your-enterprise/configuring-interactive-maps)" and the security fixes for this release.
## Enterprise Server 3.7.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.18/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.18: Security fixes](#3.7.18-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** Due to an incorrect permission assignment for some configuration files, an attacker with access to a local operating system user account could read MySQL connection details including the MySQL password. [Updated: 2023-11-13]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.18: Bug fixes](#3.7.18-bugs)

* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
* `ghe-repl-status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states and incorrectly suggested that a failover could be performed safely. In some cases, this led to data loss during failover.
* Repository exports using `ghe-migrator` or the REST API's operation for organization migrations could fail when a large number of commit comments or long commit comments were present.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, secret scanning suggested incorrect filters when viewing both open and closed alerts.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, `ghe-spokes status` did not identify Git replicas in certain incomplete states, causing a false report that replication was in sync and leading to data loss or replication issues during failover.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, dry runs sometimes incorrectly reported no results for custom patterns.
### [3.7.18: Changes](#3.7.18-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, administrators can identify the repository networks or gists that are common across a specified set of storage nodes using the `spokesctl find-on-replicas` command.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. This change strengthens GitHub Pages's symbolic link detection.
### [3.7.18: Known issues](#3.7.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
## Enterprise Server 3.7.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.17/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.17: Security fixes](#3.7.17-security-fixes)

* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
* To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.17: Bug fixes](#3.7.17-bugs)

* When displaying a list of subdomains in the Management Console, the list included the outdated `render` subdomain, and excluded the newer `containers`, `docker`, `notebook`, and `viewscreen` subdomains.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
* Duplicated intermediate commit trailers wont appear in pull request squash messages.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
* When viewing git blame data, the reviewer menu was loaded even when the suggested reviewer calculation timed out.
* When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
* On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.7.17: Changes](#3.7.17-changes)

* Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
### [3.7.17: Known issues](#3.7.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.16/download)

August 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.16: Security fixes](#3.7.16-security-fixes)

* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.16: Bug fixes](#3.7.16-bugs)

* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* When running the ghe-migrator, certain error messages contained an invalid link to import documentation.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, repository creation could fail if an organization owner did not set a primary email address.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.7.16: Changes](#3.7.16-changes)

* Administrators with SSH access to an instance can view the version of GitHub Enterprise Server on the instance by using the `-v` flag with the `ghe-version` utility.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.7.16: Known issues](#3.7.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

### [3.7.15: Security fixes](#3.7.15-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.15: Bug fixes](#3.7.15-bugs)

* In rare circumstances, Git commits signed with SSH keys using the RSA algorithm would incorrectly indicate the signature was invalid.
* Issues with cross references to pull requests from deleted accounts would not load.
* The site admin page for organizations erroneously included a "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link.
* The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.7.15: Changes](#3.7.15-changes)

* The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
* Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]

### [3.7.13: Security fixes](#3.7.13-security-fixes)

* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.7.13: Bug fixes](#3.7.13-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with custom firewall rules defined, a configuration run with `ghe-config-apply` could take longer than expected.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* When an administrator updated an instance's TLS certificate via the API as a query parameter instead of in the request body, the certificate and key appeared in `unicorn.log`.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
* After a migration using GitHub Enterprise Importer, some repository autolink references were created with an incorrect format.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, a committer would not receive an email notification for a secret scanning alert where push protections were bypassed.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if a user filtered by a custom pattern on an organizations "Code & security analysis" page using an invalid query, the entire GitHub Advanced Security disappeared and an error reading "Sorry, something went wrong loading GitHub Advanced Security settings" appeared.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
* The audit log reported the incorrect target repository for pre-receive hook failures.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* On an instance with multiple nodes, when using the `spokesctl` command-line utility to manage repositories with replicas that failed to fully create, the utility would spuriously attempt to repair healthy replicas.
### [3.7.13: Changes](#3.7.13-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* During initialization of a cluster configuration, output from the `ghe-cluster-config-init` command-line utility is improved and simplified.
* On an instance with 170 or fewer vCPUs, the default for `app.babeld.threads-max` is 512 instead of 3 times the number of vCPUs. The monitor dashboard also includes metrics within the "Babeld threads" section.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
### [3.7.13: Known issues](#3.7.13-known-issues)

## Enterprise Server 3.7.11

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.11](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.11/download)

May 30, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.11: Security fixes](#3.7.11-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Scoped installation tokens for a GitHub App kept approved permissions after the permissions on the integration installation were downgraded or removed. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
### [3.7.11: Bug fixes](#3.7.11-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when upgrading the MySQL master node, the post-upgrade configuration run would take 600 seconds longer than required due to incorrect detection of unhealthy nodes.
* In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output.
* If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 could take longer than expected.
* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, the correct path appears for manifests that originate from build-time submission snapshots.
### [3.7.11: Changes](#3.7.11-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access to an instance can configure the maximum memory usage in gigabytes for Redis using `ghe-config redis.max-memory-gb VALUE`.
### [3.7.11: Known issues](#3.7.11-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* When using an outbound web proxy server, the `ghe-btop` command may fail in some circumstances with the error "Error querying allocation: Unexpected response code: 401".
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. The performance of this upgrade has been improved in 3.6.14 and 3.7.11, however if you have tens of thousands of recently deleted repositories the upgrade could still take multiple hours. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have tens of thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]

### [3.7.10: Security fixes](#3.7.10-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog.
### [3.7.10: Bug fixes](#3.7.10-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users with the security manager role for an organization could not view GitHub Advanced Security settings for the organization.
* If a user clicked the link to share feedback or report bugs for the beta of user lists, the web interface responded with a `404` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, alerts were erroneously hidden when different vulnerabilities were detected by multiple build-time submission detectors.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.7.10: Changes](#3.7.10-changes)

* On an instance with the dependency graph enabled, background services can handle more traffic.
* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.
### [3.7.10: Known issues](#3.7.10-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)."

April 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.9: Security fixes](#3.7.9-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: An attacker with write access to a repository could craft a pull request that would hide commits made in its source branch. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23764). [Updated: 2023-07-26]
### [3.7.9: Bug fixes](#3.7.9-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* Download requests for Git LFS objects did not complete until reporting the final download size, which affected the latency of these requests, particularly on an instance with nodes functioning as repository caches.
* For instances with both GitHub Connect and automatic access to GitHub.com actions enabled, Dependabot would fail to update actions hosted on GitHub.com.
* In some cases on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users could not load the security analysis page and saw a `500` error.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, issues in private and internal repositories were not included in users search results for GitHub.com.
* After restoration of a deleted organization, the organization did not appear in the instance's list of organizations.
* Collectd logs could grow rapidly in size due to the inclusion of `kredz.*` metrics, which can't be parsed by StatsD and resulted in error messages.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
### [3.7.9: Changes](#3.7.9-changes)

* If a site administrator provides an invalid configuration for blob storage for GitHub Actions or GitHub Packages on an instance, the preflight checks page displays details and troubleshooting information.
### [3.7.9: Known issues](#3.7.9-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

## Enterprise Server 3.7.8

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.8](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.8/download)

March 23, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.8: Security fixes](#3.7.8-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Addressed an improper authentication vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to modify other users' secret gists by authenticating through an SSH certificate authority. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23761). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
* **MEDIUM**: Addressed an incorrect comparison vulnerability that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-23762](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23762). [Updated: 2023-04-07]
### [3.7.8: Bug fixes](#3.7.8-bugs)

* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, nested calls to reusable workflows within a reusable workflow job with a matrix correctly evaluate contexts within expressions, like `strategy: ${{ inputs.strategies }}`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* In some cases, graphs on the Management Console's monitor dashboard failed to render.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* On instances configured to use the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, users' authentication with SSH keys and personal access tokens failed due to an erroneous requirement for authorization.
* After a user imported a repository with push protection enabled, the repository was not immediately visible in the security overview's "Security Coverage" view.
* Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* In some cases on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server erroneously stopped writing to replica fileservers, causing repository data to fall out of sync.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table.
* An enterprise owner could not enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an instance if any enterprise owners had not enabled 2FA for their user accounts. [Updated: 2023-04-17]
* On an instance with GitHub Packages enabled, after users pushed to the Container registry, the instance erroneously responded with a `429 Too Many Requests` error in cases when the instance could accommodate the request. The limits have been raised, and users should receive this message less often. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
### [3.7.8: Changes](#3.7.8-changes)

* When the dependency submission API received a submission with one or more dependencies without a version, the dependency graph will now correctly report this fact.
* To avoid a failure during a configuration run on a cluster, validation of `cluster.conf` with the `ghe-cluster-config-check` utility ensures that the `consul-datacenter` field for each node matches the top-level `primary-datacenter` field.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
### [3.7.8: Known issues](#3.7.8-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]

### [3.7.5: Security fixes](#3.7.5-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.5: Bug fixes](#3.7.5-bugs)

* After a site administrator adjusted the cutoff date for allowing SSH connections with RSA keys using `ghe-config app.gitauth.rsa-sha1`, the instance would still disallow connections with RSA keys if the connection attempt was signed by the SHA-1 hash function.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* After disabling Dependabot updates, the avatar for Dependabot was displayed as the **@ghost** user in the Dependabot alert timeline.
* In some cases, users could experience a `500` error when viewing the **Code security & analysis** settings page for an instance with a very high number of active committers.
* Some links to contact GitHub Support or view the GitHub Enterprise Server release notes were incorrect.
* The additional committers count for GitHub Advanced Security always showed 0.
* In some cases, users were unable to convert existing issues to discussions. If an issue is stuck while being converted to a discussion, enterprise owners can review the "Known issues" section below for more information.

## Enterprise Server 3.7.3

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.3](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.3/download)

January 12, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.3: Security fixes](#3.7.3-security-fixes)

* Sanitize additional secrets in support bundles and the configuration log.
* Dependencies for the CodeQL action have been updated to the latest security versions.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.7.3: Bug fixes](#3.7.3-bugs)

* Some services incorrectly connected directly to kafka-lite instead of through its internal proxy. In a cluster environment where web services and job services execute on separate nodes, messages generated from the Insights job service werent delivered to kafka-lite.
* The metrics `Active workers` and `Queued requests` for `github` (renamed from metadata), `gitauth`, and `unicorn` container services werent correctly read from collectd and displayed in the Management Console.
* Dependabot Alert emails would be sent to disabled repositories.
* Data migrations could fail when the underlying database table contained only a single record.
* Sorting and filtering the list of custom patterns for secret scanning at the organization level did not work correctly.
* After upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, viewing the security settings page for an organization or repository could result in a `500` error due to a GitHub Advanced Security backfill job not completing before the upgrade started.
* The `git-janitor`command was unable to fix outdated `multi-pack-index.lock` files, resulting in the repository failing maintenance.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
* When updating custom patterns, the pattern state was immediately set to published.
### [3.7.3: Changes](#3.7.3-changes)

* Improved the reliability of the real time updates service (Alive) to make it more resilient against network issues with Redis.
* The `ghe-support-bundle` and `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` commands were updated to include the `-p/--period` flag to generate a time constrained support bundle. The duration can be specified in days and hours, for example: `-p '2 hours'`, `-p '1 day'`, `-p '2 days 5 hours'`.
* When upgrading an instance with a new root partition, running the `ghe-upgrade` command with the `-t/--target` option ensures the preflight check for the minimum disk storage size is executed against the target partition.
* The performance of configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` has been improved.
* When exporting account data, backing up a repository, or performing a migration, the link to a repository archive now expires after 1 hour. Previously the archive link expired after 5 minutes.
### [3.7.3: Known issues](#3.7.3-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`.

## Enterprise Server 3.7.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.7.2/download)

December 13, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.7.19) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.7.2: Security fixes](#3.7.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
### [3.7.2: Bug fixes](#3.7.2-bugs)

* A race condition blocked upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later until a site administrator retried the upgrade.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-status` command on a cache replica via the administrative shell (SSH), the command incorrectly reported overall Git and Alambic cluster replication status information as if it pertained only to cache replication.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* In a high availability configuration, after promotion of a replica to be the primary node, a site administrator could not force replication to stop on a secondary replica node using the `ghe-repl-stop -f` command.
* When using repository caching with an instance in a high availability configuration, if a Git client used SSH instead of HTTPS for a repositorys remote URL, Git LFS would fetch objects from the instances primary node instead of the appropriate cache replica node.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* In some cases, searches via the API returned a `500` error.
* Adding a collaborator to a user-owned fork of a private, organization-owned repository with triage, maintain, or custom access resulted in a `500` error.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* Dismissing a Dependabot alert that contained certain characters could result in a `400` error.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* On an instance that uses SAML for authentication, the **Configure SSO** dropdown menu appeared erroneously for personal access tokens and SSH keys.
* An upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5 to 3.7 could fail because the instance had not yet purged deleted repositories.
* In a high availability or repository caching configuration, Unicorn services on nodes other than the primary node were unable to send log events to the primary node.
* Fixes a bug in which a GHES log file could get filled very quickly and cause the root drive to run out of free space.
* When viewing code scanning results for Ruby, an erroneous beta label appeared.
### [3.7.2: Changes](#3.7.2-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot alerts, GitHub Enterprise Server enqueues the synchronization of advisory data to ensure hourly updates from GitHub.com.
* A user's list of recently accessed repositories no longer includes deleted repositories.
* For participants in the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, custom mappings for SAML user attributes are now supported. Custom mappings allow the use of a value other than `NameID` as the unique identifying claim during SAML authentication. For more information, see "[Configuring user provisioning with SCIM for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-user-provisioning-with-scim-for-your-enterprise#about-identities-and-claims)." [Updated: 2023-02-27]
### [3.7.2: Known issues](#3.7.2-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up.

For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* When validating domain settings on an instance with TLS and subdomain isolation enabled, the Management Console does not display GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7's two new subdomains, `http(s)://notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `http(s)://viewscreen.HOSTNAME`, in the list of domains. [Updated: 2023-01-12]
* For participants in the private beta of SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server, authentication for requests to resources other than the REST API using a personal access token or SSH key may not succeed. A fix will be available in a forthcoming release of GitHub Enterprise Server. [Updated: 2023-02-27]

### [3.7.1: Security fixes](#3.7.1-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: An improper neutralization of argument delimiters in a command vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that enabled remote code execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. This bug was originally reported via GitHub's Bug Bounty program and assigned [CVE-2022-23740](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23740). [Updated: 2022-12-02]
* **HIGH**: A check was added within Pages to ensure the working directory is clean before unpacking new content to prevent an arbitrary file overwrite bug. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-46255](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46255).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Scoped user-to-server tokens from GitHub Apps could bypass authorization checks in GraphQL API requests when accessing non-repository resources. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23739).
* **MEDIUM**: Pull request preview links did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing a malicious user to embed dangerous links in the instances web UI. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
### [3.7.1: Bug fixes](#3.7.1-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* Running the `ghe-spokesctl` command returned a `failed to get repo metrics` error.
* Setting the maintenance mode with an IP Exception List would not persist across upgrades.
* GitHub Pages builds could time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability.
* Status details for the replication of Git LFS objects to repository cache replica nodes were not visible in the `ghe-repl-status` output on those nodes.
* The audit log timestamp for Dependabot alert events returned the creation date of the alert instead of the timestamp when a user took action on the alert.
* When accessing an instances JavaScript resources from behind a proxy, the browser displayed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.
* If a user named a status check with leading or trailing spaces, the instance created a duplicate check if another check existed with the same name and no leading or trailing spaces.
* If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook.
* In some cases, an instance could replace an active repository with a deleted repository.
* Git LFS objects in a repository with a cache replication policy would not be copied to cache replicas if the total number of objects in the repository exceeded 5,000.
* After running migrations for the GitHub Enterprise Importer on an instance configured for high availability, replication of migration storage assets would not catch up.
* Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container.

Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]

For upgrade instructions, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.7.0: Features](#3.7.0-features)

* #### [Instance administration](#instance-administration)

  + To increase the security of the Management Console, site administrators can configure the rate limit for sign-in attempts, as well as the lockout duration after exceeding the rate limit. For more information, see "[Configuring rate limits](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-rate-limits#configuring-rate-limits-for-authentication-to-the-management-console)."
  + The minimum password requirements for the Management Console are more stringent.
  + Attempts to authenticate to the Management Console and changes made by a site administrator within the Management Console are written to a log file in `/var/log/enterprise-manage/audit.log`.
* #### [Instance services](#instance-services)

  + Azure Maps replaces MapBox for rendering GeoJSON files as graphical maps. Administrators can enable map rendering and provide an Azure Maps token in the Management Console. For more information, see "[Administering your instance from the Management Console](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console)."
* #### [Authentication](#authentication)

  + Users can verify commits using an SSH public key. For more information, see "[About commit signature verification](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification)."
  + Site administrators can provision users and groups on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance automatically with SCIM. SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server is in private beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Configuring user provisioning with SCIM for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-user-provisioning-with-scim-for-your-enterprise)" and "[SCIM](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/enterprise-admin/scim)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [GitHub Advanced Security](#github-advanced-security)

  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can view and comment on code scanning alerts in their repository within a pull request's **Conversation** tab. If the **Require conversation resolution before merging** branch protection rule is enabled for the repository, all comments on these code scanning alerts must be resolved before a user merges the pull request. For more information, see "[About code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning#about-code-scanning)," "[About pull request reviews](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)," and "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-conversation-resolution-before-merging)."
  + To simplify the rollout of secret scanning for instances with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of organizations, enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can enable secret scanning and push protection for the instance using the web interface. For more information, see "[Managing GitHub Advanced Security features for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/managing-github-advanced-security-features-for-your-enterprise)."
  + Organization owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can perform a dry run of custom patterns for secret scanning for all repositories within an organization. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + If a site administrator has enabled email notifications for an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, users who watch a repository's secret scanning alerts will receive an email notification when a contributor bypasses a secret blocked by push protection. Previously, notifications were not sent if the secret was marked as a false positive or used in tests. For more information, see "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)" and "[Configuring email for notifications](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-email-for-notifications)."
  + To ease the management of dozens or hundreds of custom patterns for secret scanning, users, organization owners, or enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can sort and filter the list of patterns for a repository, organization, or the entire instance. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license who protect pushes with secret scanning can specify a custom link that will display in the error message when push protection detects and blocks a potential secret. For more information, see "[Protecting pushes with secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/secret-scanning/protecting-pushes-with-secret-scanning)."
  + Users can publish CodeQL packs to the Container registry. For more information, see [Creating and working with CodeQL packs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-and-working-with-codeql-packs/) in the CodeQL CLI documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use CodeQL packs with code scanning, including packs that are published to the instance's GitHub Container registry. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#downloading-codeql-packs-from-github-enterprise-server)" and [Publishing and using CodeQL packs](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/publishing-and-using-codeql-packs/)" in the CodeQL CLI documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can exclude unnecessary CodeQL queries for code scanning by using query filters. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#about-code-scanning-configuration)."
  + Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can retrieve code scanning results for the entire instance using the REST API. The new endpoint supplements the existing endpoints for repositories and organizations. For more information, see "[Code Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/code-scanning#list-code-scanning-alerts-for-an-enterprise)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Organization owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can retrieve the enablement status or configure the automatic enablement of the following features using the REST API.

    - GitHub Advanced Security
    - Secret scanning
    - Push protection

    For more information, see "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/orgs/orgs#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use cursors to paginate secret scanning alert results retrieved with the REST API's organization and repository endpoints. For more information, see "[Secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/secret-scanning)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + The security overview for the instance includes information about Dependabot. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."
  + Users can see more information about the activity associated with a Dependabot alert. Within the details for a Dependabot alert, users can see a timeline of events, such as when the alert was opened, fixed, or reopened. Events will also show additional metadata when available, like relevant pull requests. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)."
  + Users' Dependabot alerts are sorted by importance by default. Importance considers CVSS as the primary factor, as well as potential risk, relevancy, and ease of fixing the vulnerability. The calculation will improve over time.
  + Users can sort Dependabot alerts by the scope of the dependency, either runtime or development.
  + Users can optionally add a comment when dismissing a Dependabot alert. Dismissal comments appear in the event timeline and within the `dismissComment` field in the GraphQL API's `RepositoryVulnerabilityAlert` object. For more information about the GraphQL API, see "[Objects](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/graphql/reference/objects#repositoryvulnerabilityalert)" in the GraphQL API documentation.
  + Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once.
  + Organization owners on an instance can retrieve the enablement status or configure the automatic enablement of the following features for dependency management using the REST API.

    - Dependency graph
    - Dependabot alerts
    - Dependabot security updates

    For more information, see "[Organizations](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/orgs/orgs#enable-or-disable-a-security-feature-for-an-organization)" in the REST API documentation.
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + Enterprise owners, organization owners, and security managers can access a centralized view of risk across the entire instance. The view also includes an alert-centric view of all code scanning, secret scanning, and Dependabot alerts. Enterprise owners can view alerts for organizations that they are owners of. Organization owners and security managers can view repositories and alerts for the organizations that they have full access to. For more information, see "[About the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/security-overview/about-the-security-overview)."
  + Organization owners can manage teams of security managers using the REST API. For more information, see "[Security Managers](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/orgs/security-managers)" in the REST API documentation.
  + Users of the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories) can now see advisories for GitHub Actions vulnerabilities. For more information, see "[Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database#about-the-github-advisory-database)."
  + Users can populate a repository's dependency graph by submitting the dependencies for the repository using the REST API. The dependency graph powers Dependabot alerts and Dependabot security updates. For more information, see "[Using the Dependency submission API](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api)."
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + GitHub Actions supports Google Cloud Storage as a storage provider for logs, artifacts, and caches. For more information, see "[Enabling GitHub Actions with Google Cloud Storage](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/enabling-github-actions-with-google-cloud-storage)."
  + GitHub Actions users who use dependency caching to speed up workflows can now use the GitHub CLI to manage the GitHub Actions cache for a repository. To manage caches using the GitHub CLI, install the `gh-actions-cache` extension. For more information, see the [`gh-actions-cache` documentation](https://github.com/actions/gh-actions-cache#readme).
  + Workflow re-runs in GitHub Actions use the actor who initially triggered the workflow for privilege evaluation. The actor who triggered the re-run will continue to be displayed in the UI, and can be accessed in a workflow via the `triggering_actor` field in the `github` context. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)" and "[Contexts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)."
  + Users can call reusable workflows from a matrix or other reusable workflows. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-reusable-workflows)."
  + When querying GitHub Actions for artifacts, the REST API returns information about the run and branch that produced the artifact. For more information, see "[GitHub Actions Artifacts](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/artifacts)" in the REST API documentation.
  + To support secure cloud deployments at scale, organization owners and repository administrators can complete the following tasks with the OpenID Connect REST API. For more information, see "[GitHub Actions OIDC](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/oidc)" in the REST API documentation

    - Enable a standard OpenID Connect configuration across cloud deployment workflows by customizing the `subject` claim format.
    - Ensure additional compliance and security for OpenID Connect deployments by appending the `issuer` URL with the enterprise's slug.
    - Configure advanced OpenID Connect policies by using additional OpenID Connect token claims like `repository_id` and `repo_visibility`.

    For more information, see "[About security hardening with OpenID Connect](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token)."
  + GitHub Actions users who use dependency caching to speed up workflows can now use the GitHub Actions Cache REST API to accomplish the following tasks.

    - List all caches within a repository and sort by metadata.
    - Delete a corrupt or stale cache entry.
      For more information, see "[Caching dependencies to speed up workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#managing-caches)" and "[GitHub Actions Cache](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/rest/actions/cache)" in the REST API documentation.
  + If a non-ephemeral self-hosted GitHub Actions runner does not communicate with the GitHub Enterprise Server instance for more than 14 days, the instance will automatically remove the runner. If an ephemeral self-hosted runner does not communicate with the instance for more than one day, the instance will automatically remove the runner. Previously, GitHub Enterprise Server removed runners after 30 days. For more information, see "[About self-hosted runners](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#about-self-hosted-runners)."
  + GitHub Actions can run self-hosted macOS workflows in a macOS ARM64 runtime with [runner](https://github.com/actions/runner) support for Apple silicon, such as the M1 or M2 chip. For more information, see "[Using self-hosted runners in a workflow](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow#using-default-labels-to-route-jobs)."
* #### [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)

  + Users can deploy a GitHub Pages site directly from a repository using GitHub Actions, without configuration of a publishing source. Using GitHub Actions provides control over the authoring framework and version, as well as more control over the publishing process with features like deployment gates. For more information, see "[Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site)."
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + Enterprise owners can prevent users from creating repositories owned by their user accounts. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-repository-creation)."
  + Enterprise owners can control where users can fork repositories. Forking can be limited to preset combinations of organizations, the same organization as the parent repository, user accounts, or everywhere. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-forking-private-or-internal-repositories)."
  + Repository administrators can block potentially destructive pushes by limiting the number of branches and tags that can be updated by a single push. By default, there is no limit to the number of branches and tags that can be updated in a single push. For more information, see "[Managing the push policy for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-push-policy-for-your-repository)."
  + Users can further customize the default commit message when squash-merging a pull request. For more information, see "[Configuring commit merging for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-merging-for-pull-requests)" and "[Configuring commit squashing for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests)."
  + Users can create a branch from a repository's **Branches** overview page by clicking the **New branch** button. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch)."
  + When a user renames or moves a file to a new directory, if at least half of the file's contents are identical, the commit history indicates that the file was renamed, similar to `git log --follow`. For more information, see the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-06-view-commit-history-across-file-renames-and-moves/). [Updated: 2023-02-10]
  + Improvements have been made to the creation and management of forks.

    - When forking a repository, users can choose to only include the repository's default branch in the fork.
    - Users can use a repository's' **Fork** button to see existing forks of the repository.
    - The **Fetch upstream** button has been renamed to **Sync fork** to better describe the button's behavior. If the sync causes a conflict, the web UI prompts the user to contribute changes to the parent repository, discard changes, or resolve the conflict.
    - To address situations where people work within one organization and don't want to fork a repository to a different organization or user account, users can fork a repository to the same organization as the parent repository.
    - Users can fork an internal repository to another organization and the fork will retain internal visibility. When forking an internal repository, users can choose which organization should own the fork.

    For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."
  + Repository administrators can block the creation of branches that match a configured name pattern with the **Restrict pushes that create matching branches** branch protection rule. For example, if a repository's default branch changes from `master` to `main`, a repository administrator can prevent any subsequent creation or push of the `master` branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#restrict-who-can-push-to-matching-branches)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule)."
  + Users can create files with geoJSON, topoJSON, and STL diagrams and render the diagrams in the web interface. For more information, see "[Working with non-code files](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files)."
  + Users can create autolink references using either alphanumeric or numeric identifiers. For more information, see "[Configuring autolinks to reference external resources autolinks](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."
  + Users can customize exclusions in the file finder like `vendor/` and `build/` by using `linguist` attributes in a `.gitattributes` file. For more information, see "[Finding files on GitHub](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/search-github/searching-on-github/finding-files-on-github#customizing-excluded-files)" and "[Customizing how changed files appear on GitHub](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/customizing-how-changed-files-appear-on-github)."
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Users can browse the files modified in an individual commit using the tree view. For more information, see "[About commits](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits#using-the-file-tree)."
* #### [Issues](#issues)

  + Users can manually link existing branches or pull requests to an issue from the "Development" section in the issue's sidebar. For more information, see "[Linking a pull request to an issue](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-or-branch-to-an-issue-using-the-issue-sidebar)."
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Users can use Mermaid syntax when writing Markdown, which displays a diagram when rendering the Markdown. For more information, see "[Creating diagrams](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)."
  + Users can write mathematical expressions using fenced code blocks with the `math` syntax in addition to the existing delimiters. `$$` is not required with this method. For more information, see "[Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)."

    - **Note**: This feature is unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7. The feature will be available in an upcoming release. [Updated: 2022-11-16]
  + Users can render maps directly in Markdown using fenced code blocks with the `geojson` or `topojson` syntax, and embed STL 3D renders using `stl` syntax. For more information, see "[Creating diagrams](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)."
  + In Markdown, users can write LaTeX-style syntax to render math expressions inline using `$` delimiters, or in blocks using `$$` delimiters. For more information, see "[Writing mathematical expressions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)."
### [3.7.0: Changes](#3.7.0-changes)

* To improve stability, the service for rendering GeoJSON, Jupyter Notebook, PDF, PSD, SVG, SolidWorks, and other binary formats has been replaced.
* If TLS and subdomain isolation are configured for your instance and your certificate is not a wildcard certificate, you must generate a new certificate that includes the additional subdomains for these services, `notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `viewscreen.HOSTNAME`. For more information, see "[Enabling subdomain isolation](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/enabling-subdomain-isolation)." [Updated: 2022-12-02]
* Secret scanning no longer supports custom patterns that use `.*` as an end delimiter in the "After secret" field, as the pattern syntax would cause scan problems and inconsistencies.
* When creating a new release, users can now submit the form using `Ctrl` + `Enter` in macOS, or `Ctrl` + `Enter` in Windows or Linux.
* The **Wiki** tab in a repository only appears when a wiki exists. Previously, the tab always appeared.
* Rendered wikis display mathematical expressions and Mermaid diagrams.
* The size of the search field for user, organization, and enterprise audit logs has increased.
* The maximum number of self-hosted runners in a runner group is limited to 10,000. Previously, there was no limit. [Updated: 2023-05-24]
* If a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved. [Updated: 2023-09-06]
### [3.7.0: Known issues](#3.7.0-known-issues)

* After an administrator upgrades from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 or 3.8, to 3.9 or 3.10, MySQL may not start back up. For more information, see "[Known issues with upgrades to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/known-issues-with-upgrades-to-your-instance#mysql-does-not-start-after-upgrade-to-github-enterprise-server-39-or-310)." [Updated: 2023-08-11]
* After restoration of a backup created using GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.0, users may not be able to sign into the instance. To fix this issue, plus a bug that was preventing secret scanning encryption keys from being backed up, upgrade your backup host to use GitHub Enterprise Server Backup Utilities 3.7.1 and generate a new full backup using `ghe-backup`. For more information on using an existing backup, see "[Known issues with backups for your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/known-issues-with-backups-for-your-instance#users-cannot-sign-in-after-restoration-of-a-backup)." [Updated: 2023-07-31]
* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
* In some cases after upgrading to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0, users may encounter `Internal Server Error` or `500` errors when initiating `git` operations over SSH or HTTPS. Example:

  ```
  git push origin master
  Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
  remote: Internal Server Error
  To ghes.hostname.com:User/repo.git
  ! [remote rejected]       master -> master (Internal Server Error)

  ```

  If these are encountered, please [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) with a support bundle. The known temporary workaround at this time is to restart the `github-gitauth` service with the commands below:

  ```
  nomad stop github-gitauth
  nomad run /etc/nomad-jobs/github/gitauth.hcl
  nomad status github-gitauth

  ```

  We are currently investigating a permanent fix for a future hot patch [Updated: 2022-11-24].
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* When validating domain settings on an instance with TLS and subdomain isolation enabled, the Management Console does not display GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7's two new subdomains, `http(s)://notebooks.HOSTNAME` and `http(s)://viewscreen.HOSTNAME`, in the list of domains. [Updated: 2023-01-12]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* On instances in a high availability configuration, site administrators should only run the `ghe-repl-start` and `ghe-repl-stop` commands while the instance is in maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode)" and "[About high availability configuration](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability/about-high-availability-configuration#utilities-for-replication-management)." [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
* On an instance hosted in AWS, system time may lose synchronization with Amazon's servers after an administrator reboots the instance. [Updated 2023-11-10]
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, restoration of a backup using `ghe-restore` will exit prematurely if Redis has not restarted properly. [Updated 2023-12-05]
* On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1. [Updated 2023-12-13]
### [3.7.0: Deprecations](#3.7.0-deprecations)

* **Upcoming deprecation**: In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.8 and later, unsecure algorithms will be disabled for SSH connections to the administrative shell.
* Commit comments, which are comments that users add directly to a commit outside of a pull request, no longer appear in the pull request timeline. Users could not reply to or resolve these comments. The Timeline events REST API and the GraphQL API's `PullRequest` object also no longer return commit comments.
* Diffing GeoJSON, PSD, and STL files is no longer possible.
* Package registries on the new GitHub Packages architecture, including Container registry and npm packages, no longer expose data through the GraphQL API. In a coming release, other GitHub Packages registries will migrate to the new architecture, which will deprecate the GraphQL API for those registries as well.
* In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 and later, GitHub is changing the supported algorithms and hash functions for Git operations over SSH. By default, SSH connections that satisfy **both** of the following conditions will fail.

  + The RSA key was added to a user account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance after the cutoff date of midnight UTC on August 1, 2022.
  + The SSH client signs the connection attempt with the SHA-1 hash function.

  You can adjust the cutoff date. For more information, see "[Configuring SSH connections to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-ssh-connections-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-09-29]
### [3.7.0: Errata](#3.7.0-errata)

* "[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.7/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
* "[Features](#3.7.0-features)" incorrectly indicated that users of the GitHub Advisory Database can see advisories for both Elixir and malware. These features are unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, and will be available in a future release. [Updated 2023-08-21]

## Enterprise Server 3.6.20

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.20](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.20/download)

October 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.20: Security fixes](#3.6.20-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.20: Bug fixes](#3.6.20-bugs)

* `/var/log/lastlog` was not copied over as a sparse file during `ghe-upgrade`, which could cause issues by using additional disk space.
### [3.6.20: Changes](#3.6.20-changes)

* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.6.20: Known issues](#3.6.20-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact).
## Enterprise Server 3.6.19

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.19](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.19/download)

September 21, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.19: Security fixes](#3.6.19-security-fixes)

* To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.19: Bug fixes](#3.6.19-bugs)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.
### [3.6.19: Changes](#3.6.19-changes)

* When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
### [3.6.19: Known issues](#3.6.19-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.18

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.18](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.18/download)

August 24, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.18: Security fixes](#3.6.18-security-fixes)

* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* An authorization/sensitive information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a fork to retain read access to an upstream repository after the fork's visibility was changed to private. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and assigned [CVE-2023-23763](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23763). [Updated: 2023-09-01]
### [3.6.18: Bug fixes](#3.6.18-bugs)

* If MinIO was configured for external blob storage on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled and MinIO was configured for bucket replication, the instance's credential validation with MinIO would occasionally fail.
* syslog-ng configurations for containerized services caused errors for log forwarding services. The configurations have been removed.
* When an instance exhausted available memory, in some cases, the system's out-of-memory killer (OOMK) killed the process for `dockerd`, causing Nomad to fail to recover after systemd restarted Docker.
* When an administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up.
* On an instance with Dependabot alerts enabled, repository creation could fail if an organization owner did not set a primary email address.
### [3.6.18: Changes](#3.6.18-changes)

* Administrators with SSH access to an instance can view the version of GitHub Enterprise Server on the instance by using the `-v` flag with the `ghe-version` utility.
* As a security measure, GitHub Pages does not build sites that contain symbolic links except when using custom GitHub Actions workflows. When the page builder encounters a symbolic link, the build will fail with an error indicating that the symbolic link should be dereferenced. Custom workflows for GitHub Pages are available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later.
### [3.6.18: Known issues](#3.6.18-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.17

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.17](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.17/download)

August 10, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.17: Security fixes](#3.6.17-security-fixes)

* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a reopened pull request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23766](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23766). [Updated: 2023-09-22]
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.17: Bug fixes](#3.6.17-bugs)

* On an instance in a high availability configuration, on some platforms, replication could perform poorly over links with very high latency.
* On an instance with custom firewall rules defined, a configuration run with `ghe-config-apply` could take longer than expected.
* Events related to repository notifications did not appear in the audit log.
* A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories.
* GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily.
* On an instance configured to use an outbound web proxy server, an administrator could not exclude private domains in [this list](https://github.com/weppos/publicsuffix-ruby/blob/main/data/list.txt) from the proxy configuration. [Updated: 2023-11-27]
### [3.6.17: Changes](#3.6.17-changes)

* The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console.
* The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`.
* Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand.
### [3.6.17: Known issues](#3.6.17-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
* If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
* When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
## Enterprise Server 3.6.16

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.16](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.16/download)

July 18, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.16: Security fixes](#3.6.16-security-fixes)

* An attacker with access to the password hash of the root site administrator user for the instance's Management Console could make requests to the password API endpoint from outside of the instance.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
* **LOW:** An incorrect comparison vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed commit smuggling by displaying an incorrect diff in a re-opened Pull Request. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need write access to the repository. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and was assigned [CVE-2023-23765](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23765).
### [3.6.16: Bug fixes](#3.6.16-bugs)

* Customers who use Azure Blob store as the remote blob provider to back GitHub Packages would have validation errors if the `EndpointSuffix` part of their Connection string was anything other than `core.windows.net`. Now all valid `EndpointSuffix` are accepted.
* After creation of a blob object from the web UI, pre-receive hook events were missing from the instance's audit log.
* On an instance with an outbound web proxy server configured, the proxy interfered with internal operations that used `nomad alloc exec`.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-balance` behaved inconsistently when displaying status or managing jobs with more than one task group.
* On an instance configured for LDAP authentication, if the LDAP server sent an empty string for the `sshPublicKey` attribute, LDAP user sync would fail.
* On an instance with Dependabot enabled, in some situations, Dependabot alerts were not updated when a user pushed to a repository.
* On an instance that was not configured to deliver email notifications using SMTP, background jobs to deliver email were enqueued unnecessarily.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, output from Git for a push blocked by push protection always included an `http://` link.
### [3.6.16: Changes](#3.6.16-changes)

* On an instance in a cluster configuration, the `ghe-cluster-config-check` command-line utility will return an affirmative message when no warnings or errors are detected. The affirmative message is "Configuration validation complete. No errors found."
* On an instance with 170 or fewer vCPUs, the default for `app.babeld.threads-max` is 512 instead of 3 times the number of vCPUs. The monitor dashboard also includes metrics within the "Babeld threads" section.
* The Management Console displays a warning about unexpected consequences that may result from modification of the instance's hostname after initial configuration.
### [3.6.16: Known issues](#3.6.16-known-issues)

* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.

* If a user's request to the instance's API included authentication credentials within a URL parameter, administrators could see the credentials in JSON within the instance's audit log.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.15: Bug fixes](#3.6.15-bugs)

* If an administrator updated the instance's TLS certificate using the Management Console API's [Set settings](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console) endpoint, sending the certificate and key data as a URL query parameter resulted in the data appearing unmasked in system logs.
* If an instance had tens of thousands of deleted repositories, an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 could take longer than expected.
* After an enterprise owner set a permanent rate limit for a users GitHub App at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/installations`, the instance did not respect the rate limit.
* Determining suggested reviewers on a pull request could time out or be very slow.
### [3.6.15: Changes](#3.6.15-changes)

### [3.6.13: Security fixes](#3.6.13-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated Git to include fixes from 2.40.1. For more information, see [Git security vulnerabilities announced](https://github.blog/2023-04-25-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced-4/) on the GitHub Blog.
### [3.6.13: Bug fixes](#3.6.13-bugs)

* Users were unable to upload GIF files as attachments within a comment in an issue or pull request.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, a `git push` operation could fail if GitHub Enterprise Server was simultaneously creating the repository on a replica node.
* A site administrator could not bypass a proxy for a top-level domain (TLD) from the instance's exception list or IANAs registered top-level domains (TLDs).
* On some platforms, after someone with administrative SSH access ran `ghe-diagnostics`, the command's output included a cosmetic `SG_IO` error.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer to import data from GitHub Enterprise Cloud, migrations failed during the import of file-level comments. This failure no longer prevents the import from proceeding.
* When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer, import of a repository failed if a project column in the repository contained 2,500 or more archived cards.
* In some situations on an instance with multiple nodes, Git replication failed to fully replicate repositories that had previously been deleted, which resulted in a warning in `ghe-repl-status` output.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was also configured for a timezone greater than UTC, the list of secret scanning alerts displayed a "Loading secrets failed" error if a user sorted secrets by date in descending order.
### [3.6.13: Changes](#3.6.13-changes)

* People with administrative SSH access who generate a support bundle using the `ghe-support-bundle` or `ghe-cluster-support-bundle` utilities can specify the period of time to gather data with `-p` or `--period` without using spaces or quotes. For example, in addition to `'-p 5 days'` or `-p '4 days 10 hours'`, `-p 5days` or `-p 4days10hours` are valid.

* In the Management Console's monitor dashboard, the `Cached Requests` and `Served Requests` graphs, which are retrieved by the `git fetch catching` command, did not display metrics for the instance.
* After a site administrator exempted the **@github-actions[bot]** user from rate limiting by using the `ghe-config app.github.rate-limiting-exempt-users "github-actions[bot]"` command, running `ghe-config-check` caused a `Validation is-valid-characterset failed` warning to appear.
* GitHub Actions (`actions`) and Microsoft SQL (`mssql`) did not appear in the list of processes within the instances monitor dashboard.
* After an administrator used the `/setup/api/start` REST API endpoint to upload a license, the configuration run failed with a `Connection refused` error during the migrations phase.
* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, users may have seen a discrepancy between the number of alerts displayed on a repositorys "Security" tab and in the sidebar for the "Security" tab.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator set maintenance mode using `ghe-maintenance -s`, a `Permission denied` error appeared when the utility tried to access `/data/user/common/cluster.conf`.
* On an instance in a high availability configuration, if an administrator tore down replication from a replica node using `ghe-repl-teardown` immediately after running `ghe-repl-setup`, but before `ghe-repl-start`, an error indicated that the script `cannot launch /usr/local/bin/ghe-single-config-apply - run is locked`. `ghe-repl-teardown` now displays an informational alert and continues the teardown.
* During configuration of high availability, if a site administrator interrupted the `ghe-repl-start` utility, the utility erroneously reported that replication was configured, and the instance would not perform expected clean-up operations.
* Responses from the `/repositories` REST API endpoint erroneously included deleted repositories.
* When a site administrator used `ghe-migrator` to migrate data to GitHub Enterprise Server, in some cases, nested team relationships would not persist after teams were imported.
* If a repository contained a `CODEOWNERS` file with check annotations, pull requests "Files changed" tab returned a `500` error and displayed "Oops, something went wrong" in the "Unchanged files with check annotations" section.
* After upgrading an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7, creating a repository or viewing the security settings page for an organization or repository could result in a `500` error due to a GitHub Advanced Security backfill job not completing before the upgrade started.
* On an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, if a user manually triggered a workflow using the REST API but did not specify values for optional booleans, the API failed to validate the request and returned a `422` error.
* The CSV reports for all users and all active users, available from the site admin dashboard, did not consider recent access using SSH or personal access tokens.
* On an instance with GitHub Connect enabled, if "Users can search GitHub.com" was enabled, users would not see issues in private and internal repositories in search results for GitHub.com.
* GitHub Enterprise Server published distribution metrics that cannot be processed by collectd. The metrics included `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.referenced_oids`, `pre_receive.lfsintegrity.dist.unknown_oids`, and `git.hooks.runtime`.
* On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, if code scanning had been used while running GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 or earlier, a subsequent upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6 or 3.7 could fail when attempting to add a unique index to a database table.
* On an instance with GitHub Packages enabled, after users pushed to the Container registry, the instance erroneously responded with a `429 Too Many Requests` error in cases when the instance could accommodate the request. The limits have been raised, and users should receive this message less often. [Updated: 2023-05-30]
### [3.6.11: Changes](#3.6.11-changes)

* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot updates, the instance creates the initial set of updates faster.
* On an instance in a cluster configuration, when a site administrator sets maintenance mode on a single cluster node using `ghe-maintenance -s`, the utility warns the administrator to use `ghe-cluster-maintenance -s` to set maintenance mode on all of the clusters nodes. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode#enabling-or-disabling-maintenance-mode-for-all-nodes-in-a-cluster)."
* When a site administrator configures an outbound web proxy server for GitHub Enterprise Server, the instance now validates top-level domains (TLDs) excluded from the proxy configuration. By default, you can exclude public TLDs that the IANA specifies. Site administrators can specify a list of unregistered TLDs to exclude using `ghe-config`. The `.` prefix is required for any public TLDs. For example, `.example.com` is valid, but `example.com` is invalid. For more information, see "[Configuring an outbound web proxy server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-network-settings/configuring-an-outbound-web-proxy-server)."
* To avoid intermittent issues with the success of Git operations on an instance with multiple nodes, GitHub Enterprise Server checks the status of the MySQL container before attempting a SQL query. The timeout duration has also been reduced.
* The default path for output from `ghe-saml-mapping-csv -d` is `/data/user/tmp` instead of `/tmp`. For more information, see "[Command-line utilities](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/command-line-utilities#ghe-saml-mapping-csv)."
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.11: Known issues](#3.6.11-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* Following an upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, existing inconsistencies in a repository such as broken refs or missing objects, may now be reported as errors like `invalid sha1 pointer 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, `Zero-length loose reference file`, or `Zero-length loose object file`. Previously, these indicators of repository corruption may have been silently ignored. GitHub Enterprise Server now uses an updated Git version with more diligent error reporting enabled. For more information, see this [upstream commit](https://github.com/git/git/commit/968f12fdac) in the Git project.

  If you suspect a problem like this exists in one of your repositories, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance.
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* On an instance configured for SAML authentication, when signing in, users may erroneously see an error indicating "User has already been taken." [Updated: 2023-07-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]

### [3.6.8: Security fixes](#3.6.8-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: A code injection vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed setting arbitrary environment variables from a single environment variable value in GitHub Actions when using a Windows based runner due to improper sanitization of null bytes. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need existing permission to control the value of environment variables for use with GitHub Actions. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2023-22381](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22381).
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.8: Bug fixes](#3.6.8-bugs)

* After a site administrator adjusted the cutoff date for allowing SSH connections with RSA keys using `ghe-config app.gitauth.rsa-sha1`, the instance would still disallow connections with RSA keys if the connection attempt was signed by the SHA-1 hash function.
* During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object error` may have occurred for the Notebook and Viewscreen services.
* When enabling automatic TLS certificate management with Let's Encrypt, the process could fail with the error `The certificate is not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) or the certificate chain in missing intermediate CA signing certificates`.
* In some cases, users were unable to convert existing issues to discussions. If an issue is stuck while being converted to a discussion, enterprise owners can review the "Known issues" section below for more information.
### [3.6.8: Changes](#3.6.8-changes)

* When a timeout occurs during diff generation, such as when a commit displays an error that the diff is taking too long to generate, the `push` webhook event will deliver empty diff information. Previously, the `push` webhook event would fail to be delivered.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later.

January 12, 2023

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.6: Security fixes](#3.6.6-security-fixes)

* Sanitize additional secrets in support bundles and the configuration log.
* Dependencies for the CodeQL action have been updated to the latest security versions.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.6: Bug fixes](#3.6.6-bugs)

* The metrics `Active workers` and `Queued requests` for `github` (renamed from metadata), `gitauth`, and `unicorn` container services werent correctly read from collectd and displayed in the Management Console.
* Dependabot Alert emails would be sent to disabled repositories.
* Data migrations could fail when the underlying database table contained only a single record.
* When viewing a pull requests diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* The `git-janitor`command was unable to fix outdated `multi-pack-index.lock` files, resulting in the repository failing maintenance.
* The `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts were incorrectly set as `false` when branch protections did exist.
* Dropped `launch.*` metrics that can't be parsed by statsd, as the resulting statsd errors caused collectd logs to grow rapidly in size.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.5

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.5](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.5/download)

December 13, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.5: Security fixes](#3.6.5-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed remote code execution when building a GitHub Pages site. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the instance. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-46256).
* **HIGH**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin access for a repository. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.0. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23741](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23741).
* **MEDIUM**: An information disclosure vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed private repositories to be added to a GitHub Actions runner group via the API by a user who did not have access to those repositories, resulting in the repository names being shown in the UI. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the GHES instance, permissions to modify GitHub Actions runner groups, and successfully guess the obfuscated ID of private repositories. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46257).
### [3.6.5: Bug fixes](#3.6.5-bugs)

* A race condition blocked upgrades to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later until a site administrator retried the upgrade.
* Site administrators were not able to manage security products settings for repositories they had unlocked.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-status` command on a cache replica via the administrative shell (SSH), the command incorrectly reported overall Git and Alambic cluster replication status information as if it pertained only to cache replication.
* When a site administrator ran the `ghe-repl-sync-ca-certificates` command from an instances primary node via the administrative shell (SSH), the command only replicated CA certificates from the instances primary node to a single replica node. The command did not replicate the certificates to all available replica nodes.
* When using repository caching with an instance in a high availability configuration, if a Git client used SSH instead of HTTPS for a repositorys remote URL, Git LFS would fetch objects from the instances primary node instead of the appropriate cache replica node.
* Installation of GitHub Enterprise Server on the VMware ESXi hypervisor failed due to the generation of an OVA file with an invalid capacity value.
* When users performed an operation using the API, GitHub Enterprise Server enforced repository size quotas even when disabled globally.
* If a user uploaded more than one file while creating a new Gist, the user could not delete any files uploaded after the first.
* In some cases, searches via the API returned a `500` error.
* In some cases, when browsing repositories in the web interface, an erroneous banner indicated that a repository didn't contain a specific undefined path on the current branch.
* The `member` webhook event did not include the `from` and `to` field values for the `permission` field as part of the `changes` field.
* Adding a collaborator to a user-owned fork of a private, organization-owned repository with triage, maintain, or custom access resulted in a `500` error.
* In some cases, the page for setting up code scanning would erroneously report that GitHub Actions was not configured for the instance.
* After a user's account was deleted from the instance, image attachments that the user uploaded in comments were no longer visible in the web interface.
* A debug-level message appeared in a system log, which could consume space rapidly on the instance's root storage volume.
### [3.6.5: Changes](#3.6.5-changes)

* To avoid failing domain verification due to the 63-character limit enforced by DNS providers for DNS records, the GitHub-generated `TXT` record to verify domain ownership is now limited to 63 characters.
* After an enterprise owner enables Dependabot alerts, GitHub Enterprise Server enqueues the synchronization of advisory data to ensure hourly updates from GitHub.com.
* A user's list of recently accessed repositories no longer includes deleted repositories.
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)."

### [3.6.4: Security fixes](#3.6.4-security-fixes)

* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Scoped user-to-server tokens from GitHub Apps could bypass authorization checks in GraphQL API requests when accessing non-repository resources. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23739](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23739).
* **MEDIUM**: Pull request preview links did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing a malicious user to embed dangerous links in the instances web UI. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com).
* **MEDIUM**: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a repository-scoped token with read/write access to modify GitHub Actions workflow files without a workflow scope. The "[Repository contents](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/repos/contents#create-or-update-file-contents)" should enforce workflow scope. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com) and has been assigned [CVE-2022-46258](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46258).
### [3.6.4: Bug fixes](#3.6.4-bugs)

* If a GitHub Actions dependency uses a pinned SHA version, Dependabot will no longer mark the dependency as vulnerable.
* Setting the maintenance mode with an IP Exception List would not persist across upgrades.
* GitHub Pages builds could time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability.
* Status details for the replication of Git LFS objects to repository cache replica nodes were not visible in the `ghe-repl-status` output on those nodes.
* After configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would send digest emails to suspended users.
* The audit log timestamp for Dependabot alert events returned the creation date of the alert instead of the timestamp when a user took action on the alert.
* When using the CodeQL action, the runs annotations would include a spurious `HttpError: Upload not found` error.
* When accessing an instances JavaScript resources from behind a proxy, the browser displayed Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.
* If a user named a status check with leading or trailing spaces, the instance created a duplicate check if another check existed with the same name and no leading or trailing spaces.
* If a user configured a pre-receive hook for multiple repositories, the instances **Hooks** page would not always display the correct status for the hook.
* In some cases, an instance could replace an active repository with a deleted repository.
* Git LFS objects in a repository with a cache replication policy would not be copied to cache replicas if the total number of objects in the repository exceeded 5,000.
* After running migrations for the GitHub Enterprise Importer on an instance configured for high availability, replication of migration storage assets would not catch up.
* Zombie processes no longer accumulate in the `gitrpcd` container.
### [3.6.4: Changes](#3.6.4-changes)

* If a site administrator has not yet configured GitHub Actions for the instance, the UI for setting up code scanning will prompt the user to configure GitHub Actions.

### [3.6.3: Security fixes](#3.6.3-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: Updated dependencies for the Management Console to the latest patch versions, which addresses security vulnerabilities including [CVE-2022-30123](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wq4h-7r42-5hrr) and [CVE-2022-29181](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m).
* **HIGH**: Added checks to address an improper cache key vulnerability that allowed an unauthorized actor to access private repository files through a public repository. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-23738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23738).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated [CommonMarker](https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker) to address a scenario where parallel requests to the Markdown REST API could result in unbounded resource exhaustion. This vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2022-39209](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39209).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated Redis to 5.0.14 to address [CVE-2021-32672](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32672) and [CVE-2021-32762](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32762).
* **MEDIUM**: Updated GitHub Actions runners to fix a bug that allowed environment variables in GitHub Actions jobs to escape the context of the variable and modify the invocation of `docker` commands directly. For more information, see the [Actions Runner security advisory](https://github.com/actions/runner/security/advisories/GHSA-2c6m-6gqh-6qg3).
* **MEDIUM**: An improper privilege management vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed users with improper privileges to create or delete pages via the API. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be added to an organization's repo with write permissions. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned [CVE-2022-23737](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23737).
* **LOW**: Due to a CSRF vulnerability, a `GET` request to the instance's `site/toggle_site_admin_and_employee_status` endpoint could toggle a user's site administrator status unknowingly.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.3: Bug fixes](#3.6.3-bugs)

* After a site administrator made a change that triggered a configuration run, such as disabling GitHub Actions, validation of services would sometimes fail with the message `WARNING: Validation encountered a problem`.
* After a site administrator installed a hotpatch containing changes to web interface assets such as JavaScript files or images, the instance did not serve the new assets.
* When a user accessed a renamed repository using Git, the hostname in the Git output incorrectly indicated GitHub.com instead of the instance's hostname.
* On instances using LDAP authentication and LDAP sync, sync would fail and print `undefined method ord for nil:NilClass` in `ldap-sync.log`.
* When a user visited links to view history or suggest an improvement to the GitHub Advisory Database, the URLs were incorrect, resulting in a `404` error.
* Deleted assets and assets scheduled to be purged within a repository, such as LFS files, took too long to to be cleaned up.
* On instances configured for high availability, `ghe-repl-status` incorrectly reported that replication was behind for repositories that users had previously deleted.
* If a user installed a GitHub App for the user account and then converted the account into an organization, the app was not granted organization permissions.
* Missing secret scanning alerts on instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license that was not upgraded directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4 are now visible in the web interface and through the REST API.
* In some cases, on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license, some tokens detected by secret scanning were reported as "unknown tokens."
### [3.6.3: Changes](#3.6.3-changes)

* To ensure that site administrators can successfully complete an upgrade, the instance will now execute a preflight check to ensure that the virtual machine meets minimum hardware requirements.

### [3.6.3: Known issues](#3.6.3-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* On an instance configured for SAML authentication, when signing in, users may erroneously see an error indicating "User has already been taken." [Updated: 2023-07-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages.

## Enterprise Server 3.6.2

[Download GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.2](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.6.2/download)

September 21, 2022

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.2: Features](#3.6.2-features)

* Repository archives for migrations now include an `is_archived` field.
### [3.6.2: Security fixes](#3.6.2-security-fixes)

* **HIGH**: A GitHub App could use a scoped user-to-server token to bypass user authorization logic and escalate privileges.
* **LOW**: Granting a user the ability to bypass branch protections no longer allows the user to bypass the requirement for signature verification.
* Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
### [3.6.2: Bug fixes](#3.6.2-bugs)

* In some cases, collectd could log excessive metrics-related errors in `/var/log/collectd.log`.
* When configuring the external domain name of a repository cache replica node using `ghe-repl-node --cache-domain`, the command would return an error that prevented Git LFS caching from being enabled.
* Installation of a TLS certificate failed when the certificate's subject string included UTF-8 characters.
* Configuration runs could fail when `retry-limit` or `retry-sleep-duration` were manually set by an administrator using `ghe-config`.
* The option to enable TLS encryption for incoming SMTP connections to an instance was missing from the Management Console.
* In some cases, the Management Console's monitor dashboard would not load correctly.
* Removed a non-functional link for exporting Management Console monitor graphs as a PNG image.
* The `ghe-find-insecure-git-operations` command did not return all insecure Git operations after each invocation.
* When sending a support bundle to GitHub Enterprise Support using `ghe-support-upload`, the `-t` option would not successfully associate the uploaded bundle with the specified ticket.
* A link back to the security settings for the instance's enterprise account could render an incorrect view.
* In rare cases, an upgrade from GitHub Enterprise Server 3.3 to 3.4 would incorrectly modify how data is stored, resulting in failures during future upgrades. When upgrading directly to this release from 3.3, the failure will not occur.
* When using a VPC endpoint URL as an AWS S3 URL for GitHub Packages, publication and installation of packages failed.
* Git clones or fetches over SSH could experience data corruption for transfers over 1GB in size.
* After a user deleted or restored packages from the web interface, counts for packages could render incorrectly.
* After successful configuration of Dependabot and alert digest emails, the instance would not send digest emails.
* Manually disabled GitHub Actions workflows in a repository were re-enabled if the repository received a push containing more than 2048 commits, or if the repository's default branch changed.
* When viewing a pull request's diff for a large file with many lines between changes, it was not possible to expand the view to display all of the changes.
* If branch protections were enabled, the `GITHUB_REF_PROTECTED` environment variable and `github.ref_protected` contexts for GitHub Actions workflow runs were incorrectly set as `false`.
* Repositories for packages erroneously displayed a "Used by" section.
### [3.6.2: Changes](#3.6.2-changes)

📣 This is not the [latest patch release](#3.6.20) of this release series, and this is not the [latest release](/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes) of Enterprise Server. Please use the latest release for the latest security, performance, and bug fixes.

### [3.6.1: Bug fixes](#3.6.1-bugs)

* After unlocking a repository for temporary access, a site administrator was unable to manage settings for security products in the repository.
* Duplicate administrative SSH keys could appear in both the Management Console and the `/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* The site admin page for individual users at `http(s)://HOSTNAME/stafftools/users/USERNAME/admin` contained functionality not intended for GitHub Enterprise Server.
* In some cases, running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` could replicate an empty configuration to existing nodes in a cluster.
* In some cases, configuration runs started with `ghe-config-apply` did not complete, or returned a `Container count mismatch` error.
* After updating a self-signed TLS certificate on a GitHub Enterprise Server instance, UI elements on some pages in the web interface did not appear.
* In some cases, background tasks could stall due to a library that was used concurrently despite not being thread-safe.
* The site admin bar at the top of the web interface contained a broken link to the SHA for the currently running version of the application.
* Organization owners were unable to set the level of access required to create discussions.
* Discussions users were incorrectly directed to the community guidelines for GitHub.com.
* In some cases, users were incorrectly instructed to verify their email before creating a discussion.
* Alerts from secret scanning for GitHub Advanced Security customers were missing in the web UI and REST API if a site administrator did not upgrade directly to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. The alerts are now visible.
### [3.6.1: Changes](#3.6.1-changes)

* Generation of support bundles is faster as a result of parallelized log sanitization. For more information about support bundles, see "[Providing data to GitHub Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/providing-data-to-github-support)."
* APIs that contain the `organization` or `org` route now accept either the organization's slug or ID. Previously, the APIs only accepted slugs, which caused `Link` headers for GitHub Advanced Security endpoints to be inaccessible. For more information, see "[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/orgs)" in the REST API documentation.
* The enterprise audit log now includes more user-generated events, such as `project.create`. The REST API also returns additional user-generated events, such as `repo.create`. For more information, see "[Accessing the audit log for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/accessing-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise)" and "[Using the audit log API for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/using-the-audit-log-api-for-your-enterprise#querying-the-audit-log-rest-api)."
* In some cases, cache replicas could reject some Git operations on recently updated repositories. For more information about repository caching, see "[About repository caching](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/caching-repositories/about-repository-caching)."
* You can now configure the global announcement banner to be dismissable using the REST API.

    - "[Secret Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/secret-scanning#list-secret-scanning-alerts-for-an-enterprise)" in the REST API documentation
  + Enterprise owners on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can perform dry runs of custom secret scanning patterns for the enterprise, and all users can perform dry runs when editing a pattern. Dry runs allow you to understand a pattern's impact across the entire instance and hone the pattern before publication and generation of alerts. For more information, see "[Defining custom patterns for secret scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/secret-scanning/defining-custom-patterns-for-secret-scanning)."
  + Users on an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license can use `sort` and `direction` parameters in the REST API when retrieving secret scanning alerts, and sort based on the alert’s `created` or `updated` fields. The new parameters are available for the entire instance, or for individual organizations or repositories. For more information, see the following documentation.

    - "[List secret scanning alerts for an enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/secret-scanning#list-secret-scanning-alerts-for-an-enterprise)"

    - "[Secret Scanning](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/rest/secret-scanning)" in the REST API documentation
  + The contents of the `github/codeql-go` repository have moved to the `github/codeql` repository, to live alongside similar libraries for all other programming languages supported by CodeQL. The open-source CodeQL queries, libraries, and extractor for analyzing codebases written in the Go programming language with GitHub's CodeQL code analysis tools can now be found in the new location. For more information, including guidance on migrating your existing workflows, see [github/codeql-go#741](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/issues/741).
* #### [Dependabot](#dependabot)

  + Enterprise owners on instances with a GitHub Advanced Security license can see an overview of Dependabot alerts for the entire instance, including a repository-centric view of application security risks, and an alert-centric view of all secret scanning and Dependabot alerts. The views are in beta and subject to change, and alert-centric views for code scanning are planned for a future release of GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[Viewing the security overview](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/security-overview/viewing-the-security-overview#viewing-the-security-overview-for-an-enterprise)."
  + Users can select multiple Dependabot alerts, then dismiss or reopen or dismiss the alerts. For example, from the **Closed alerts** tab, you can select multiple alerts that have been previously dismissed, and then reopen them all at once. For more information, see "[About Dependabot alerts](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."

    - **Note**: This feature is unavailable in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0. The feature is available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7.0 and later. [Updated: 2022-10-19]
  + Dependabot updates `@types` dependencies alongside corresponding packages in TypeScript projects. Before this change, users would see separate pull requests for a package and the corresponding `@types` package. This feature is automatically enabled for repositories containing `@types` packages in the project's `devDependencies` within the *package.json* file. You can disable this behavior by setting the [`ignore`](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#ignore) field in your `dependabot.yml` file to `@types/*`. For more information, see "[About Dependabot version updates](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)" and "[Configuration options for the *dependabot.yml* file](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file)."
* #### [Code security](#code-security)

  + GitHub Actions can enforce dependency reviews on users' pull requests by scanning for dependencies, and will warn users about associated security vulnerabilities. The `dependency-review-action` action is supported by a new API endpoint that diffs the dependencies between any two revisions. For more information, see "[About dependency review](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review#dependency-review-enforcement)."
  + The dependency graph detects *Cargo.toml* and *Cargo.lock* files for Rust. These files will be displayed in the **Dependency graph** section of the **Insights** tab. Users will receive Dependabot alerts and updates for vulnerabilities associated with their Rust dependencies. Package metadata, including mapping packages to repositories, will be added at a later date. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)."
  + If GitHub Connect is enabled for your instance, users can contribute an improvement to a security advisory in the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories). To contribute, click **Suggest improvements for this vulnerability** while viewing an advisory's details. For more information, see the following articles.

    - "[Managing GitHub Connect](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-github-connect/managing-github-connect)"
    - "[Browsing security vulnerabilities in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/browsing-security-vulnerabilities-in-the-github-advisory-database)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation
    - "[About GitHub Security Advisories for repositories](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation
    - "[Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation
* #### [GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

  + Within a workflow that calls a reusable workflow, users can pass the secrets to the reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`. For more information, see "[Reusing workflows](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#using-inputs-and-secrets-in-a-reusable-workflow)."
  + When using GitHub Actions, to reduce the risk of merging a change that was not reviewed by another person into a protected branch, enterprise owners and repository administrators can prevent Actions from creating pull requests. Organization owners could previously enable this restriction. For more information, see the following articles.

    - "[Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
    - "[Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
    - "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests)"
  + Users can write a single workflow triggered by `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call`, and use the `inputs` context to access input values. Previously, `workflow_dispatch` inputs were in the event payload, which increased difficulty for workflow authors who wanted to write one workflow that was both reusable and manually triggered. For workflows triggered by `workflow_dispatch`, inputs are still available in the `github.event.inputs` context to maintain compatibility. For more information, see "[Contexts](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#inputs-context)."
  + To summarize the result of a job, users can generate Markdown and publish the contents as a job summary. For example, after running tests with GitHub Actions, a summary can provide an overview of passed, failed, or skipped tests, potentially reducing the need to review the full log output. For more information, see "[Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary)."
  + To more easily diagnose job execution failures during a workflow re-run, users can enable debug logging, which outputs information about a job's execution and environment. For more information, see "[Re-running workflows and jobs](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs)" and "[Using workflow run logs](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures)."
  + If you manage self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions, you can ensure a consistent state on the runner itself before and after a workflow run by defining scripts to execute. By using scripts, you no longer need to require that users manually incorporate these steps into workflows. Pre- and post-job scripts are in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Running scripts before or after a job](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/running-scripts-before-or-after-a-job)."
* #### [GitHub Packages](#github-packages)

  + Enterprise owners can migrate container images from the GitHub Docker registry to the GitHub Container registry. The Container registry provides the following benefits.

    - Improves the sharing of containers within an organization
    - Allows the application of granular access permissions
    - Permits the anonymous sharing of public container images
    - Implements OCI standards for hosting Docker images

    The Container registry is in beta and subject to change. For more information, see "[Migrating your enterprise to the Container registry from the Docker registry](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/packages/migrating-your-enterprise-to-the-container-registry-from-the-docker-registry)."
* #### [Community experience](#community-experience)

  + GitHub Discussions is available for GitHub Enterprise Server. GitHub Discussions provides a central gathering space to ask questions, share ideas, and build connections. For more information, see "[GitHub Discussions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/discussions)."
  + Enterprise owners can configure a policy to control whether people's usernames or full names are displayed within internal or public repositories. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-the-display-of-member-names-in-your-repositories)."
* #### [Organizations](#organizations)

  + Users can create member-only READMEs for an organization. For more information, see "[Customizing your organization's profile](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)."
  + Organization owners can pin a repository to an organization's profile directly from the repository via the new **Pin repository** dropdown. Pinned public repositories appear to all users of your instance, while public, private, and internal repositories are only visible to organization members.
* #### [Repositories](#repositories)

  + While creating a fork, users can customize the fork's name. For more information, see "[Fork a repo](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)."
  + Users can delete a branch that's associated with an open pull request. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)."
  + Repositories with multiple licenses display all of the licenses in the "About" sidebar on the  **Code** tab. For more information, see "[Licensing a repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)."
  + Users can require a successful deployment of a branch before anyone can merge the pull request associated with the branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-deployments-to-succeed-before-merging)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
  + Enterprise owners can prevent organization owners from inviting collaborators to repositories on the instance. For more information, see "[Enforcing a policy for inviting collaborators to repositories](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-collaborators-to-repositories)."
  + Users can grant exceptions to GitHub Apps for any branch protection rule that supports exceptions. For more information, see "[About apps](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)" and "[Managing a branch protection rule](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)."
* #### [Commits](#commits)

  + For public GPG signing keys that are expired or revoked, GitHub Enterprise Server verifies Git commit signatures and show commits as verified if the user made the commit while the key was still valid. Users can also upload expired or revoked GPG keys. For more information, see "[About commit signature verification](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)."
  + To affirm that a commit complies with the rules and licensing governing a repository, organization owners and repository administrators can now require developers to sign off on commits made through the web interface. For more information, see "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-organization)" and "[Managing the commit signoff policy for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-repository)."
* #### [Pull requests](#pull-requests)

  + Using the file tree located in the **Files changed** tab of a pull request, users can navigate modified files, understand the size and scope of changes, and focus reviews. The file tree appears if a pull request modifies at least two files, and the browser window is sufficiently wide. For more information, see "[Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)" and "[Filtering files in a pull request](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/filtering-files-in-a-pull-request)."
  + Users can default to using pull requests titles as the commit message for all squash merges. For more information, see "[Configuring commit squashing for pull requests](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests)."
* #### [GitHub Mobile](#github-mobile)

  + In GitHub Mobile for iOS 1.80.0 and later, users can edit files within a pull request's topic branch. Support for editing files will come to GitHub Mobile for Android in a future release. [Updated: 2022-09-13]
* #### [Releases](#releases)

  + When viewing the details for a particular release, users can see the creation date for each release asset. For more information, see "[Viewing your repository's releases and tags](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags)."
  + While creating a release with automatically generated release notes, users can see the tag identified as the previous release, then choose to select a different tag to specify as the previous release. For more information, see "[Automatically generated release notes](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes)."
* #### [Markdown](#markdown)

  + Editing Markdown in the web interface has been improved.

    - After a user selects text and pastes a URL, the selected text will become a Markdown link to the pasted URL.
    - When a user pastes spreadsheet cells or HTML tables, the resulting text will render as a table.
    - When a user copies text containing links, the pasted text will include the link as a Markdown link.

    For more information, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)."
  + When editing a Markdown file in the web interface, clicking the **Preview** tab will automatically scroll to the place in the preview that you were editing. The scroll location is based on the position of your cursor before you clicked the **Preview** tab.
### [3.6.0: Changes](#3.6.0-changes)

* The unencrypted and unauthenticated Git protocol is now disabled by default. If you do not re-enable the protocol after you upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or later, `git://` connections on port 9418 will return the following error.

  ```
  The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported.

  ```

  If you wish to support the protocol in your environment, you must manually re-enable the feature. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#configuring-anonymous-git-read-access)" and the [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-28-improving-git-protocol-security-on-github-enterprise-server/). [Updated: 2023-01-31]
* Interactive elements in the web interface such as links and buttons show a visible outline when focused with a keyboard, to help users find the current position on a page. In addition, when focused, form fields have a higher contrast outline.
* VMware vSphere ESXi hypervisor version 7.0 is now supported. [Updated: 2022-09-07]
* Releases in the 3.6 series of GitHub Enterprise Server are no longer suitable for testing SCIM. To continue using the private beta of SCIM, upgrade your instance to version 3.7.3 or later. For more information, see "[Upgrading GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/enterprise-management/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/upgrading-github-enterprise-server)." [Updated: 2023-04-17]
### [3.6.0: Known issues](#3.6.0-known-issues)

* On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
* Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
* Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
* When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
* Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
* Actions services need to be restarted after restoring an instance from a backup taken on a different host.
* In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
* In some cases, users cannot convert existing issues to discussions.
* Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.
* In some cases, GitHub Advanced Security customers who upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 may notice that alerts from secret scanning are missing in the web UI and REST API. To ensure the alerts remain visible, do not skip 3.4 as you upgrade to the latest release. To plan an upgrade through 3.4, see the [Upgrade assistant](https://support.github.com/enterprise/server-upgrade).

  + To display the missing alerts for all repositories owned by an organization, organization owners can navigate to the organization's **Code security and analysis** settings, then click **Enable all** for secret scanning. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#enabling-or-disabling-a-feature-for-all-existing-repositories)."
  + To display the missing alerts for an individual repository, people with admin access to the repository can disable then enable secret scanning for the repository. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your repository](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository)."

  A fix is available in the [3.6.1](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/release-notes#3.6.1) patch release.

  [Updated: 2022-09-01]
* After upgrading a replica node to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6.0 or later and restarting replication, Git replication may stop progressing and continue to show `WARNING: git replication is behind the primary …`. If you encounter this known issue, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket). [Updated: 2022-10-03]
* GitHub Pages builds may time out on instances in AWS that are configured for high availability. [Updated: 2022-11-28]
* Instances experiencing a high sustained number of concurrent Git requests may experience performance issues. If you suspect that this issue is affecting your instance, contact GitHub Support. For more information, see "[Creating a support ticket](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket)."
* On instances in a high availability configuration, `git push` operations may fail in the following situations.

  + During creation of the repository on a replica node
  + After failure to create the repository on a replica node, before automatic repair of the repository [Updated: 2023-03-17]
* An upgrade to GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 or 3.7 from 3.5 or earlier may be long running if a large number of deleted repositories exist. Deleted repositories are purged automatically after 90 days, but for a faster upgrade they can be purged manually. If you suspect you have thousands of recently deleted repositories, and you are concerned about a long running upgrade, [contact GitHub Enterprise Support](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/support/contacting-github-support/creating-a-support-ticket) for assistance purging deleted repositories. [Updated: 2023-05-09]
* On an instance configured for SAML authentication, when signing in, users may erroneously see an error indicating "User has already been taken." [Updated: 2023-07-18]
* In rare circumstances, a small instance with both high availability and GitHub Actions configured may report that MSSQL replication is unhealthy after many upgrades with full upgrade packages. If you encounter this issue, [contact GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact). [Updated: 2023-08-24]
### [3.6.0: Deprecations](#3.6.0-deprecations)

* #### [Changes to supported SSH algorithms](#changes-to-supported-ssh-algorithms)

  + In GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6 and later, GitHub is changing the supported algorithms and hash functions for Git operations over SSH. By default, SSH connections that satisfy **both** of the following conditions will fail.

    - The RSA key was added to a user account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance after the cutoff date of midnight UTC on August 1, 2022.
    - The SSH client signs the connection attempt with the SHA-1 hash function.

    You can adjust the cutoff date. For more information, see "[Configuring SSH connections to your instance](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/configuring-ssh-connections-to-your-instance)." [Updated: 2023-01-31]
### [3.6.0: Errata](#3.6.0-errata)

* "[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-server%403.6/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)" incorrectly indicated that secrets for GitHub Actions are encrypted in the instance's database. The article has been updated to reflect that secrets are not encrypted on the instance. To encrypt secrets at rest, you must encrypt your instance's block storage device. For more information, refer to the documentation for your hypervisor or cloud service. [Updated: 2023-06-01]
* The "Changes" section of these release notes indicated that if a user refreshes the page while creating a new issue or pull request, the assignees, reviewers, labels and projects will all be preserved. This change is not available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, but is available in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7 and later. [Updated: 2023-09-06]
