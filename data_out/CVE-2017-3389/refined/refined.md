    "information": "The provided document is a Critical Patch Update advisory from Oracle, which includes information about CVE-2017-3389.\n\n**CVE-2017-3389** is listed as one of the CVEs addressed by the fix for **CVE-2017-3373** in Oracle E-Business Suite.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Not explicitly stated, but it falls under the category of 'User Interface' in 'Oracle Advanced Outbound Telephony'.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The specific vulnerability is not described in detail but is related to the user interface component of the Oracle Advanced Outbound Telephony module. The provided table entry indicates a weakness that can lead to a Changed scope in the CVSS vector.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to a 'Changed' scope impact, with High confidentiality impact, Low integrity impact, and no availability impact. This would typically involve unauthorized access to sensitive data and the potential for limited modification of data, but no denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is 'Network', and the protocol involved is 'HTTP'.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server and the user interaction is required. This indicates that exploitation involves a user's action, such as a click that causes the malicious request to be made by the user on behalf of the attacker (likely an XSS vulnerability).\n\nThe document also indicates that this CVE is one of a group of CVEs that share the same description, vulnerability type, Component, Sub-Component and affected versions listed in the risk matrix entry, but occur in different code sections within the Sub-Component. All are addressed with the same patch."
