Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-46125:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Fides webserver API allowed users to retrieve its configuration via the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint.
- Although the configuration data was filtered to remove most sensitive information, the filtered data still contained internal details, backend infrastructure information, server addresses, ports, and database usernames.
- The vulnerability was caused by the `CONFIG_READ` scope being incorrectly assigned to roles with lower privileges (e.g. `viewer` and `contributor`), allowing them to access this configuration data which should have been restricted to higher privilege roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to configuration data, which included potentially sensitive information about the system's internals.
- Inadequate Access Control: Lower-privileged users were able to access data meant for administrative users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could gain knowledge of internal infrastructure details, server addresses, ports, and database usernames. This information could be used to potentially carry out further attacks.
- The vulnerability exposed information useful for both administrative users and attackers.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the API endpoint: `GET api/v1/config`.
- Any Admin UI user with the viewer or contributor role could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with a viewer or contributor role within the Fides application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version `2.22.1` by removing the `CONFIG_READ` scope from the `viewer` and `contributor` roles.
- There are no workarounds mentioned.
- The vulnerability is considered to have low severity.
