- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Fan Page Widget by ThemeNcode plugin (versions <= 2.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, which allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when guests visit the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts through the plugin's interface. The required privilege for this is Administrator.
