# Weave GitOps leaked cluster credentials into logs on connection errors

Critical

published
GHSA-xggc-qprg-x6mw
Jun 23, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v0.8.1-rc.5

## Patched versions

v0.8.1-rc.6

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters, including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage if enabled by the management cluster.

This vulnerability is due to the client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all cluster configurations of registered clusters.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage the registered Kubernetes clusters.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed by commit [567356f](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/commit/567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca). Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps core version >= v0.8.1-rc.6 released on 31/05/2022.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

### References

Disclosed by Stefan Prodan, Principal Engineer, Weaveworks.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
