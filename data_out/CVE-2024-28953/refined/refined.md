Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path in some EMON (likely an abbreviation for a specific Intel component or functionality related to monitoring/profiling).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The software searches for resources in locations that are not properly controlled. This could allow a malicious user to place a crafted file or resource in a location that the software will access, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should normally have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have some form of authentication on the system, as the vulnerability description mentions "an authenticated user".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the vulnerable software.
- The attacker must be able to place files or resources in locations that will be accessed by the vulnerable software due to the uncontrolled search path.
- User Interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Intel® Graphics Performance Analyzers (Intel® GPA), Intel® VTune™ Profiler, and Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit software before specific versions.
- The advisory provides specific versions that fix the issue and links to download the updated software.
- The CVSS scores indicate that this is a medium severity vulnerability.
- Intel thanks Mohamed amine saidani for reporting the issue.
