- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the certificate import feature, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into system calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection [CWE-78]
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized operating system commands. This may result in complete compromise of the system depending on the privileges of the user that runs the command.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the management interface of FortiTester by manipulating the arguments passed to the certificate import feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the management interface of FortiTester and have sufficient privileges to interact with the certificate import function.
