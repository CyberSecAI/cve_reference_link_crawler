- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect file permission assignment for critical resources allows low-privilege users to edit scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability due to incorrect permission assignment (CWE-732).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Low-privilege users can edit scripts, bypassing Access Control Lists (ACLs), and potentially gain further access within the system, leading to unauthorized actions and potentially complete control.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low-privilege user account on the affected system.
