Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-21751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an input verification issue within the ZTE BigVideo analysis product. Specifically, there's an inconsistency between front-end and back-end verifications when configuring the large screen page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of consistent validation between the front-end and back-end during the configuration of the large screen page. This allows for manipulation of inputs that should be rejected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Exception:** Successful exploitation can lead to a service exception, indicating disruption or malfunction of the affected service.
*   **URL Tampering:** Attackers can manipulate URLs due to the inconsistent validation, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially unauthorized actions.
*   **Information Integrity:** While there is a "low" impact on data integrity, the attacker can still alter the URL, indicating that data integrity is not completely protected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the URL when configuring the large screen page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges:** An attacker needs to have high privileges within the system to exploit this vulnerability. This indicates the attacker must already have some level of access and permissions.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker also needs to make changes to the large screen page, which requires some user interaction.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** The vulnerability affects the "ZXIN10 CMS" product.
*  **Affected Versions:** All versions up to "ZXOMS-BIGDATA-IOPSWEBV3.01.01.04" are affected
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is resolved in version "ZXOMS-BIGDATA-IOPSWEBV8.01.01.01".
*   The vulnerability was found by ZTE's internal testing team.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.5 (Medium), indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   The official description of CVE-2021-21751 in the NVD is: "ZTE BigVideo analysis product has an input verification vulnerability. Due to the inconsistency between the front and back verifications when configuring the large screen page, an attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to tamper with the URL and cause service exception."
