- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), low privileges required (PR:L), user interaction is required (UI:R), scope changed (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low privileges needs to inject malicious scripts that will be stored and executed when other users interact with the affected part of the application.
