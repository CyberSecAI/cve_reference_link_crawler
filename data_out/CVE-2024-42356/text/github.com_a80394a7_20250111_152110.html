# Server Side Template Injection in Twig using Context functions

GHSA-35jp-8cgg-p4wj

## Package

composer

shopware/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 6.5.8.12
>= 6.6.0.0 <=6.6.5.0

## Patched versions

6.5.8.13
6.6.5.1

composer

shopware/platform
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

<= 6.5.8.12
>= 6.6.0.0 <=6.6.5.0

6.5.8.13
6.6.5.1

## Description

### Impact

The `context` variable is injected into almost any Twig Template and allows to access to current language, currency information. The context object allows also to switch for a short time the scope of the Context as a helper with a callable function.

Example call from PHP:

```
$context->scope(Context::SYSTEM_SCOPE, static function (Context $context) use ($mediaService, $media, &$fileBlob): void {
    $fileBlob = $mediaService->loadFile($media->getId(), $context);
});
```

This function can be called also from Twig and as the second parameter allows any callable, it's possible to call from Twig any staticly callable PHP function/method.

It's not possible as customer to provide any Twig code, the attacker would require access to Administration to exploit it using Mail templates or using App Scripts.

### Patches

Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13

### Workarounds

For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
