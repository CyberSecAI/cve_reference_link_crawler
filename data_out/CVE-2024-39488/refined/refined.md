- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When `CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n`, the assembly code that creates bug table entries does not include explicit padding at the end of the entry, which is necessary for correct alignment as per the arm64 ABI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The lack of trailing padding bytes for bug entries when `CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n` causes `module_bug_finalize()` to miscalculate the number of bug entries. This leads to `module_find_bug()` missing the last entry.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This can cause a kernel panic due to an unhandled bug, because the last bug entry will be missed, preventing the kernel from finding the appropriate handler.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a module containing a `WARN()` call (or any similar bug reporting macro) is loaded into the kernel with `CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE=n` on arm64 architecture.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to load a custom kernel module into the system.
