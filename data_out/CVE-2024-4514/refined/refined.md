Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `grade` parameter within the `/view/timetable_insert_form.php` file of the "Complete Web-Based School Management System".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `grade` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the context of a user's browser session when they access the vulnerable page.
*  **System compromise**: The injected script could redirect the user to malicious websites, display inappropriate content, steal cookies, or download malware, potentially compromising the user's system.
*   **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation can harm the reputation of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `grade` parameter within the vulnerable file path `/view/timetable_insert_form.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `grade` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is `grade`.
*   The vulnerable file is `/view/timetable_insert_form.php`.
*   The provided payload is `grade=grade'"()%26%25<zzz><ScRiPt%20>alert(9902)</ScRiPt>` which includes a script tag with an alert function.
*  The vulnerable software is "Campcodes Complete Web-Based School Management System" version 1.0 or lower.
