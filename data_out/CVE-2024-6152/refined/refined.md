**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `flipbox_builder_Flipbox_ShortCode` function which deserializes data from the `flipbox_builder_Flipbox_data` meta field without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The function `unserialize(get_post_meta($PostId, 'flipbox_builder_Flipbox_data', true))` deserializes data retrieved from the database. This can lead to PHP Object Injection if the serialized data is crafted maliciously.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the input before deserialization.
- **Dependency on User Provided Input:** The content of the post meta `flipbox_builder_Flipbox_data` comes from user input when creating/editing a flipbox item.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If a suitable POP chain (a sequence of code that can be executed through the vulnerable deserialization) exists in the WordPress installation (through other plugins or themes), an attacker could:
    - Delete arbitrary files.
    - Retrieve sensitive data.
    - Execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `Flipbox` shortcode.
- An attacker can inject a malicious serialized PHP object by creating a flipbox item containing the malicious serialized data in the `flipbox_builder_Flipbox_data` meta field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher.
- They need the ability to create or edit content on the WordPress site to add the malicious data to the post meta.
