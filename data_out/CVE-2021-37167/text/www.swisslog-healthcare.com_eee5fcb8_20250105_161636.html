Workaround and Mitigation
Network firewalls
Network firewalls that restrict inter-VLAN traffic on the network must allow inbound and
outbound internal network connections for the ports listed in “Windows firewalls”. Do not restrict
these ports to specific applications.

Layer 3 Access Control List
If there is no firewall between the SCC and the floor devices, apply an extended access control
list (ACL) in the layer 3 VLAN that is dedicated to the PTS floor equipment. Both inbound and
outbound access lists are required between the SCC server and floor equipment, allowing the
use of the TCP and UDP ports listed.

Swisslog Healthcare recommends upgrading to the latest software version as soon as available.
