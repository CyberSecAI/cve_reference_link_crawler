# Diagnosis and therapy at the right place at the right time.

We support hospitals in **initiating therapies** quickly and reliably. On the one hand, we achieve this with automated and traceable transport solutions for critical goods, such as laboratory samples and medications. Our advanced pharmacy systems, on the other hand, support the various hospital processes, from automated storage and retrieval to fully automated, patient-specific therapy preparation.

Swisslog Healthcare is the only provider to offer **storage and transport processes along the supply chain of** [medication management](/en-gb/medication-management) from one single source. We also have a team that drives developments in both transport and pharmacy automation, based on the specific requirements of the hospital environment.

## Do you know what’s behind these numbers?

![Illustration of key figures](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/medication-management-figures.jpg?rev=ed118ca69753412aa4a1d96711502157&w=1920&hash=E61408BF89403461CC9E70124FCAD356)

* #### **20 %** of the medicines purchased by a hospital never reach the patient's bedside.

  ![Illustration of 20 %]()

  German hospitals spend 4.3 billion euros per year on pharmaceuticals, which results in an annual medication waste of 860 million euros plus cost-intensive disposal. On an unweighted average, this means 1.5 million euros in drug losses per year for each hospital in Germany.

  A hospital-wide **inventory control system** for pharmaceuticals supports hospitals in **reducing costs**, **optimizing processes**, and **redistributing medications**. The software Pharmacy Manager monitors and optimizes all medication stocks, from the central pharmacy to the wards. The [robotic dispensing](/en-gb/medication-management/robotic-dispensing) systems, BoxPicker and EvoTec, in the central pharmacy as well as automated dispensing cabinets **counteract medication waste**.

  This interaction increases the cost-related efficiency of clinics.
* #### Up to **10 %** of medications administered in clinics are mistaken.

  ![Illustration of 10 %]()

  This conflicts with the hospital's core task of achieving treatment success. However, such errors can be avoided by ensuring **seamless tracking** of all patient medications.

  In particular, unit doses increase **medication and, thus, therapy safety**. Errors in medication dispensing can be almost completely avoided if unit doses are already bundled into patient-specific therapies in the central pharmacy, for example with a [unit dose system](/en-gb/products/pharmacy-automation/pillpick).
* #### **6.8 %** of vacancies for clinical nursing staff already exceed the total resources available in Germany.

  ![Illustration of 6.8 %]()

  This represents a **deficit of nearly 20,000 people** to ensure the quality of care. In addition, forecasts show that the shortage of skilled workers will continue to worsen in the coming years. Projections indicate that up to 640,000 vacancies in Germany alone will not be filled by 2035.

  In order to maintain a **high quality of care** despite shortages of personnel, clinical staff must be relieved of non-patient-centric tasks wherever possible. **Automation** and **digitization** go hand in hand in this approach.

  [Transport solutions](/en-gb/products/transport) reduce errands; unit dose systems enable time-saving centralized therapy creation and dispensing; and integrated [software solutions](/en-gb/products/software) prevent time-consuming documentation of the ordering, tracking, and dispensing processes.

## Leaders of better care

You know that the best therapy only works if it’s adhered to. Your goal is to discharge **satisfied and healthy patients** who return home with the feeling of having been in the best hands. We know we can't replace the best hands, but we can help them do their job while maintaining the **highest quality**.

It's difficult to implement changes based on [automated solutions](/en-gb/products) without increasing the level of complexity. It often requires a **mindset shift**—one that you initiate.

## Change for better care

Swisslog Healthcare is the only company that does not focus its development efforts on intralogistics and pharmacy automation but is specifically dedicated to **intralogistics and medication management in hospitals**.

We are your partner in implementing your clinic-specific change in areas that really count: for improved clinical processes, for the deployment of your nursing staff in line with their core competencies, and for the patients. **Together** with you and thanks to reliable systems, user-oriented software, and specific components, we take you step by step along the path to better patient care.

## What is most important for your patients?

## Align all steps in your medication management.

Our goal is to combine transport and pharmacy automation into one holistic medication management solution. Let’s close the loop together and deliver the right medication at the right place and time.

[Find your solution](/en-gb/medication-management)

![Female pharmacist](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/persona-pharmacy-automation.jpg?rev=4d4528a770054e9886eaa64cfb9de162&w=1900&hash=6E68F0518FD149AE0362F9ABEE562906)

## Pharmacy automation that sustainably reduces complexity

The integration of automation solutions aims to increase efficiencies, close safety gaps and **improve the overall therapy quality**. However, implementing automation into pharmacies also means changing processes within the pharmacy and at the point of care. Though, this incremental sophistication does not necessarily mean increasing complexity.

To really reach a sustainable **simplification of work processes**, we analyze your status quo and prioritize your goals together – in order not to offer you a standard product, but to develop a step-by-step solution to simplify the inventory of medications and the administration of the patient therapy.

## Close the loop. From the central pharmacy to the point of care.

![Illustration hospital environment](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/hospital-pharmacists.jpg?rev=2d37fb33d9134282ba0b320127a87527&w=1920&hash=587AD31C018E9C07C8883EDC57155A1E)

* #### Optimize your drug inventory.

  ![Illustration of a pharmacist in a hospital pharmacy]()

  In a decentralized medication management approach ward stocks are supplied and replenished by the [hospital pharmacy](/en-gb/medication-management/hospital-pharmacy). In this scenario, **demand-driven and predictive inventory management**, combined with the ability to **track and monitor medications**, are key to cost savings, streamlined drug procurement and inventory management.

  **Robotic dispensing systems** such as BoxPicker or EvoTec support the medication supply chain in your hospital or hospital group.
* #### A unit-dose approach enhances patient safety.

  ![Illustration of a unit dose ring]()

  Many hospital pharmacists place a higher priority on **medication and patient safety** instead of just increasing operational effectiveness. By using a unit dose system, patient therapies are provided **fully automatically** from the central pharmacy.

  In doing so, the integrity of the **original packaging is maintained.** Thus, documentation is adhered to, and since the medications have **patient-independent packaging,** they can easily be returned to the system when they were not used.

  Using the robot-based solution, a completely centralized medication management can be implemented. However, typically a small decentralized storage is recommended for acute medications.

  [Learn more about the unit dose approach.](/en-gb/company/blog/how-unit-doses-improve-clinical-workflows)
* #### Accurate and safe dispensing at your clinical points of care.

  ![Illustration of two nurses]()

  In both the centralized and decentralized medication management models, safe medication handling as well as **accurate and secure dispensing at the point of care** become possible with MedSMART [automated dispensing cabinets](/en-gb/company/blog/drug-dispensing-with-automated-dispensing-cabinet). Digitalized drug handling processes on the wards guide caregivers to the right drug in the right dose for the right patient.

  Automated dispensing cabinets supports storage and retrieval of all medication forms, including bulky and refrigerated drugs, and are tailored and [configurated](/en-gb/products/pharmacy-automation/medsmart/configurator) to your specific needs.

## Europe lacks **1 million** caregivers

Within the upcoming years, Europe can’t fill the position of one million caregivers because qualified staff are missing. Automation solutions help you **solve efficiency problems** and **economical challenges** in your pharmacy that arise due to the staff shortage.

Our technology relieves pharmaceutical staff of repetitive, mundane tasks, allowing them to **devote more time to actual patient care**.

## Transport solutions, tailored to the specific requirements of hospitals

In the areas of pneumatic tube systems (PTS) and autonomous transport robots, we are the only company to focus on the **hospital environment** in terms of **development, product safety and service**. Regarding planning and architecture, you benefit from standardized solutions and connections that go beyond the safety and performance requirements of hospitals. Our user components have been specifically developed to meet the needs of the main users on the wards, in the laboratory and in the central pharmacy.

The high reliability is tested and proven several times before realization. Our **service teams**, which support you in your daily work, are not only technicians but also PTS experts. This ensures fast and targeted support for your operation.

## From user requirements to system

![Illustration of transport workflows in a hospital](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/logistic-experts-pts-workflows.jpg?rev=e66a451c4c05417a82a11fa7c27aebd7&w=1920&hash=7C6991344AE9F60C1712C3B685126583)

* ![Illustration laboratory]()

  **Reliable delivery**, **traceable transport**, ensuring the **integrity of lab samples**, and direct **connection to analysis lines**—these are the core requirements for lab transport solutions.

  You can meet these demands already during planning or in the course of retrofitting with the following options:

  + Delivery Manager software to digitally track the whereabouts of samples in real time.
  + Special inlays for containers prevent shocks to the laboratory samples.
  + Fully automated connection of the [PTS to the analysis lines](/en-gb/company/blog/lab-automation-with-openlog-interface) with the OpenLog station and transport extensions.
* ![Illustration of a femal pharmacist in a hospital pharmacy]()

  Frequent **requests for information** on the whereabouts of medications for wards, the planning and execution of the **delivery of time-sensitive medications**, and the time-consuming, **multi-step documentation** of medication transport cause interruptions in pharmacy workflows, locking up valuable resources.

  Our solutions support employees in the central pharmacy:

  + Requests are reduced through shipment tracking with Delivery Manager.
  + The [pneumatic tube system](/en-gb/company/blog/how-a-pneumatic-tube-system-works) can be integrated directly, for example, with the PillPick unit dose system.
  + Networked inventory and transport software solutions streamline documentation.
* ![Illustration of nursing staff on a ward]()

  The **shortage of skilled workers** makes every minute that nursing staff gain for patient care even more valuable. They are faced with **time-consuming manual transport** over several floors, **verbal inquiries** regarding the whereabouts of required medications, and **possible malfunctions of transport systems**.

  Our systems address these issues in the right way to optimize efficiency on patient wards and relieve nursing staff:

  + **Fewer errands** through the use of the pneumatic tube system, [TranspoNet](/en-gb/products/transport/transponet-pneumatic-tube-system).
  + **Reliable, traceable transport** and secure removal of critical goods.
  + **Fast troubleshooting** by in-house technicians with the use of the new TranspoNet software.

### **3** departments document the same transport

Even simple transports usually require 3 independent departments, all of which are obliged to document the transport.

Critical goods, such as special prescriptions and blood bags, require seamless and **elaborate transport documentation**. This multi-layered documentation demands a great deal of time and resources. If this is not fulfilled, the hospital runs the risk of a negative reputation and complaints from the state authorities.

Digitize and streamline the transport documentation of individual process steps. Our software enables simpler, safer, and more effective management and coordination of workflows.

### About **75 %** of all errors occur during the preanalytical phase

Damaged samples can no longer be used for analysis, which delays diagnostics and the initiation of therapy for patients. The economic consequences for the hospital should not be neglected either: Damaged samples are associated with an average **loss of 157 €** each.

Errors are partly caused by **improper transport**. Faults in the pneumatic tube system are detected too late. There is a lack of data on the current quality of the transported samples, and profound analyses are difficult to implement in everyday work due to staff shortages.

In order to detect possible impairments of the transport solutions at an early stage and to implement countermeasures, a [proactive analysis of the PTS logistics](/en-gb/products/software/delivery-manager) is recommended.
