# Diagnosis and therapy at the right place at the right time.

We support hospitals in **initiating therapies** quickly and reliably. On the one hand, we achieve this with automated and traceable transport solutions for critical goods, such as laboratory samples and medications. Our advanced pharmacy systems, on the other hand, support the various hospital processes, from automated storage and retrieval to fully automated, patient-specific therapy preparation.

Swisslog Healthcare is the only provider to offer **storage and transport processes along the supply chain of** [medication management](/en-gb/medication-management) from one single source. We also have a team that drives developments in both transport and pharmacy automation, based on the specific requirements of the hospital environment.

## Do you know what’s behind these numbers?

![Illustration of key figures](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/medication-management-figures.jpg?rev=ed118ca69753412aa4a1d96711502157&w=1920&hash=E61408BF89403461CC9E70124FCAD356)

* #### **20 %** of the medicines purchased by a hospital never reach the patient's bedside.

  ![Illustration of 20 %]()

  German hospitals spend 4.3 billion euros per year on pharmaceuticals, which results in an annual medication waste of 860 million euros plus cost-intensive disposal. On an unweighted average, this means 1.5 million euros in drug losses per year for each hospital in Germany.

  A hospital-wide **inventory control system** for pharmaceuticals supports hospitals in **reducing costs**, **optimizing processes**, and **redistributing medications**. The software Pharmacy Manager monitors and optimizes all medication stocks, from the central pharmacy to the wards. The [robotic dispensing](/en-gb/medication-management/robotic-dispensing) systems, BoxPicker and EvoTec, in the central pharmacy as well as automated dispensing cabinets **counteract medication waste**.

  This interaction increases the cost-related efficiency of clinics.
* #### Up to **10 %** of medications administered in clinics are mistaken.

  ![Illustration of 10 %]()

  This conflicts with the hospital's core task of achieving treatment success. However, such errors can be avoided by ensuring **seamless tracking** of all patient medications.

  In particular, unit doses increase **medication and, thus, therapy safety**. Errors in medication dispensing can be almost completely avoided if unit doses are already bundled into patient-specific therapies in the central pharmacy, for example with a [unit dose system](/en-gb/products/pharmacy-automation/pillpick).
* #### **6.8 %** of vacancies for clinical nursing staff already exceed the total resources available in Germany.

  ![Illustration of 6.8 %]()

  This represents a **deficit of nearly 20,000 people** to ensure the quality of care. In addition, forecasts show that the shortage of skilled workers will continue to worsen in the coming years. Projections indicate that up to 640,000 vacancies in Germany alone will not be filled by 2035.

  In order to maintain a **high quality of care** despite shortages of personnel, clinical staff must be relieved of non-patient-centric tasks wherever possible. **Automation** and **digitization** go hand in hand in this approach.

  [Transport solutions](/en-gb/products/transport) reduce errands; unit dose systems enable time-saving centralized therapy creation and dispensing; and integrated [software solutions](/en-gb/products/software) prevent time-consuming documentation of the ordering, tracking, and dispensing processes.

## Leaders of better care

You know that the best therapy only works if it’s adhered to. Your goal is to discharge **satisfied and healthy patients** who return home with the feeling of having been in the best hands. We know we can't replace the best hands, but we can help them do their job while maintaining the **highest quality**.

It's difficult to implement changes based on [automated solutions](/en-gb/products) without increasing the level of complexity. It often requires a **mindset shift**—one that you initiate.

## Change for better care

Swisslog Healthcare is the only company that does not focus its development efforts on intralogistics and pharmacy automation but is specifically dedicated to **intralogistics and medication management in hospitals**.

We are your partner in implementing your clinic-specific change in areas that really count: for improved clinical processes, for the deployment of your nursing staff in line with their core competencies, and for the patients. **Together** with you and thanks to reliable systems, user-oriented software, and specific components, we take you step by step along the path to better patient care.

## What is most important for your patients?

## Align all steps in your medication management.

Our goal is to combine transport and pharmacy automation into one holistic medication management solution. Let’s close the loop together and deliver the right medication at the right place and time.

[Find your solution](/en-gb/medication-management)

![Female pharmacist](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/persona-pharmacy-automation.jpg?rev=4d4528a770054e9886eaa64cfb9de162&w=1900&hash=6E68F0518FD149AE0362F9ABEE562906)

## Pharmacy automation that sustainably reduces complexity

The integration of automation solutions aims to increase efficiencies, close safety gaps and **improve the overall therapy quality**. However, implementing automation into pharmacies also means changing processes within the pharmacy and at the point of care. Though, this incremental sophistication does not necessarily mean increasing complexity.

To really reach a sustainable **simplification of work processes**, we analyze your status quo and prioritize your goals together – in order not to offer you a standard product, but to develop a step-by-step solution to simplify the inventory of medications and the administration of the patient therapy.

## Close the loop. From the central pharmacy to the point of care.

![Illustration hospital environment](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/hospital-pharmacists.jpg?rev=2d37fb33d9134282ba0b320127a87527&w=1920&hash=587AD31C018E9C07C8883EDC57155A1E)

* #### Optimize your drug inventory.

  ![Illustration of a pharmacist in a hospital pharmacy]()

  In a decentralized medication management approach ward stocks are supplied and replenished by the [hospital pharmacy](/en-gb/medication-management/hospital-pharmacy). In this scenario, **demand-driven and predictive inventory management**, combined with the ability to **track and monitor medications**, are key to cost savings, streamlined drug procurement and inventory management.

  **Robotic dispensing systems** such as BoxPicker or EvoTec support the medication supply chain in your hospital or hospital group.
* #### A unit-dose approach enhances patient safety.

  ![Illustration of a unit dose ring]()

  Many hospital pharmacists place a higher priority on **medication and patient safety** instead of just increasing operational effectiveness. By using a unit dose system, patient therapies are provided **fully automatically** from the central pharmacy.

  In doing so, the integrity of the **original packaging is maintained.** Thus, documentation is adhered to, and since the medications have **patient-independent packaging,** they can easily be returned to the system when they were not used.

  Using the robot-based solution, a completely centralized medication management can be implemented. However, typically a small decentralized storage is recommended for acute medications.

  [Learn more about the unit dose approach.](/en-gb/company/blog/how-unit-doses-improve-clinical-workflows)
* #### Accurate and safe dispensing at your clinical points of care.

  ![Illustration of two nurses]()

  In both the centralized and decentralized medication management models, safe medication handling as well as **accurate and secure dispensing at the point of care** become possible with MedSMART [automated dispensing cabinets](/en-gb/company/blog/drug-dispensing-with-automated-dispensing-cabinet). Digitalized drug handling processes on the wards guide caregivers to the right drug in the right dose for the right patient.

  Automated dispensing cabinets supports storage and retrieval of all medication forms, including bulky and refrigerated drugs, and are tailored and [configurated](/en-gb/products/pharmacy-automation/medsmart/configurator) to your specific needs.

## Europe lacks **1 million** caregivers

Within the upcoming years, Europe can’t fill the position of one million caregivers because qualified staff are missing. Automation solutions help you **solve efficiency problems** and **economical challenges** in your pharmacy that arise due to the staff shortage.

Our technology relieves pharmaceutical staff of repetitive, mundane tasks, allowing them to **devote more time to actual patient care**.

## Transport solutions, tailored to the specific requirements of hospitals

In the areas of pneumatic tube systems (PTS) and autonomous transport robots, we are the only company to focus on the **hospital environment** in terms of **development, product safety and service**. Regarding planning and architecture, you benefit from standardized solutions and connections that go beyond the safety and performance requirements of hospitals. Our user components have been specifically developed to meet the needs of the main users on the wards, in the laboratory and in the central pharmacy.

The high reliability is tested and proven several times before realization. Our **service teams**, which support you in your daily work, are not only technicians but also PTS experts. This ensures fast and targeted support for your operation.

## From user requirements to system

![Illustration of transport workflows in a hospital](/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/images/home/logistic-experts-pts-workflows.jpg?rev=e66a451c4c05417a82a11fa7c27aebd7&w=1920&hash=7C6991344AE9F60C1712C3B685126583)

* ![Illustration laboratory]()

  **Reliable delivery**, **traceable transport**, ensuring the **integrity of lab samples**, and direct **connection to analysis lines**—these are the core requirements for lab transport solutions.

  You can meet these demands already during planning or in the course of retrofitting with the following options:

  + Delivery Manager software to digitally track the whereabouts of samples in real time.
  + Special inlays for containers prevent shocks to the laboratory samples.
  + Fully automated connection of the [PTS to the analysis lines](/en-gb/company/blog/lab-automation-with-openlog-interface) with the OpenLog station and transport extensions.
* ![Illustration of a femal pharmacist in a hospital pharmacy]()

  Frequent **requests for information** on the whereabouts of medications for wards, the planning and execution of the **delivery of time-sensitive medications**, and the time-consuming, **multi-step documentation** of medication transport cause interruptions in pharmacy workflows, locking up valuable resources.

  Our solutions support employees in the central pharmacy:

  + Requests are reduced through shipment tracking with Delivery Manager.
  + The [pneumatic tube system](/en-gb/company/blog/how-a-pneumatic-tube-system-works) can be integrated directly, for example, with the PillPick unit dose system.
  + Networked inventory and transport software solutions streamline documentation.
* ![Illustration of nursing staff on a ward]()

  The **shortage of skilled workers** makes every minute that nursing staff gain for patient care even more valuable. They are faced with **time-consuming manual transport** over several floors, **verbal inquiries** regarding the whereabouts of required medications, and **possible malfunctions of transport systems**.

  Our systems address these issues in the right way to optimize efficiency on patient wards and relieve nursing staff:

  + **Fewer errands** through the use of the pneumatic tube system, [TranspoNet](/en-gb/products/transport/transponet-pneumatic-tube-system).
  + **Reliable, traceable transport** and secure removal of critical goods.
  + **Fast troubleshooting** by in-house technicians with the use of the new TranspoNet software.

### **3** departments document the same transport

Even simple transports usually require 3 independent departments, all of which are obliged to document the transport.

Critical goods, such as special prescriptions and blood bags, require seamless and **elaborate transport documentation**. This multi-layered documentation demands a great deal of time and resources. If this is not fulfilled, the hospital runs the risk of a negative reputation and complaints from the state authorities.

Digitize and streamline the transport documentation of individual process steps. Our software enables simpler, safer, and more effective management and coordination of workflows.

### About **75 %** of all errors occur during the preanalytical phase

Damaged samples can no longer be used for analysis, which delays diagnostics and the initiation of therapy for patients. The economic consequences for the hospital should not be neglected either: Damaged samples are associated with an average **loss of 157 €** each.

Errors are partly caused by **improper transport**. Faults in the pneumatic tube system are detected too late. There is a lack of data on the current quality of the transported samples, and profound analyses are difficult to implement in everyday work due to staff shortages.

In order to detect possible impairments of the transport solutions at an early stage and to implement countermeasures, a [proactive analysis of the PTS logistics](/en-gb/products/software/delivery-manager) is recommended.

Information:
information/cve-disclosures

swisslog-healthcare.com/en-us/customer-care/security-

Summary

An insecure permissions issue was discovered in HMI-3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare
Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. A user
logged in using the default credentials can gain root access to the device, which provides
permissions for all of the functionality of the device.

Affected Products
The following table lists the product impacted by the vulnerabilities listed above and the current
state of remediation planning.

Product
HMI-3 Panel

Fix Version
7.2.5.7

Target Release Date
August 2, 2021

Workaround and Mitigation
Network firewalls
Network firewalls that restrict inter-VLAN traffic on the network must allow inbound and
outbound internal network connections for the ports listed in “Windows firewalls”. Do not restrict
these ports to specific applications.

Layer 3 Access Control List
If there is no firewall between the SCC and the floor devices, apply an extended access control
list (ACL) in the layer 3 VLAN that is dedicated to the PTS floor equipment. Both inbound and
outbound access lists are required between the SCC server and floor equipment, allowing the
use of the TCP and UDP ports listed.

General Security Recommendations
Swisslog Healthcare recommends upgrading to the latest software version as soon as available.

Vulnerability Classification
The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in
version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) (NVD - CVSS v3 Calculator (nist.gov). The CVSS environmental score
is specific to the customer’s environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The
environmental score should therefore be individually defined by the customer to accomplish final
scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37167
To exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker must be on the local network.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score
CVSS v3.1 Vector:
CWE Reference:

9.1
AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CWE-250

Recommended Actions

# Nine Vulnerabilities in Critical Infrastructure Used by 80% of Major Hospitals in North America

### What was Discovered?

Armis researchers have identified a set of nine critical vulnerabilities in the leading solution for pneumatic tube systems (PTS) in North America – the Translogic PTS system by Swisslog Healthcare. This system is used in over [80% of hospitals in North America](https://www.swisslog-healthcare.com/-/media/swisslog-healthcare/documents/products-and-services/transport/translogic-pts/pts-513-swisslog-healthcare-delivers-unmatched-innovation.pdf?rev=b22ea11dac49417697716cbc93afc7fe&hash=BECBF557F88BF22AEF64E05631D221B4), and installed in more than 3,000 hospitals worldwide. PTS systems play a crucial role in patient care, and are utilized nearly 100% of the time.

Dubbed PwnedPiper, the vulnerabilities allow for complete take over of the Translogic Nexus Control Panel, which powers all current models of Translogic PTS stations. Older IP-connected Translogic stations are also impacted, but are no longer supported by Swisslog.

This blog will provide a high-level overview of this research and its implications. Additional material is available here:

* [Technical Research Paper](https://media.armis.com/pdfs/wp-Armis-PwnedPiper-en.pdf) on the PwnedPiper vulnerabilities
* [White paper](https://www.armis.com/white-papers/securing-the-patient-journey-operational-considerations-to-drive-cyber-resilience/) on how Armis helps healthcare institutions with operational considerations to drive cyber resilience
* Swisslog’s [security advisories](https://www.swisslog-healthcare.com/en-us/customer-care/security-information) on the discovered vulnerabilities

### Why is this Important?

The Swisslog PTS system is vital to hospital operations as it automates logistics and the transport of materials throughout the hospital via a network of pneumatic tubes. The system is designed so that hospitals can provide better patient care with automated material transport that includes highly sensitive materials such as lab specimens, blood products, pathology lab tests, medications, and more. Prior to the use of PTS systems, hospitals were required to transfer the various items manually. Today due to their wide adoption, [these systems are vital for proper workflow](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2010/01/gone-with-the-wind-tubes-are-whisking-samples-across-hospital.html) of hospital operations.

### The Process:

Armis reported the vulnerabilities to Swisslog on May 1, 2021, and has worked with them ever since to fully understand the impact of the vulnerabilities, develop and test a patch that would remediate them, and develop mitigation steps until a patch is installed.

Swisslog Healthcare has released a security advisory today, that is available [here](https://www.swisslog-healthcare.com/en-us/company/news#publications).

See our proposed mitigation steps and how the Armis platform detects and mitigates these vulnerabilities below.

### How Could PwnedPiper Be Used?

These vulnerabilities can enable an unauthenticated attacker to take over Translogic PTS stations and essentially gain complete control over the PTS network of a target hospital. This type of control could enable sophisticated and worrisome ransomware attacks, as well as allow attackers to leak sensitive hospital information.

The Translogic PTS system is an advanced system that integrates with other hospital systems, which may allow the information shared between these systems to be leaked or manipulated by an attacker if the Translogic PTS network were to be compromised.

Here are examples of such advanced features, and the risks they entail:

1. The PTS system includes the *WhoTube* integration with a hospital’s access control system. This integration allows authentication of staff members using their RFID cards, limiting access to PTS stations, and allowing the use of Secure Transfers, in which carriers are released to a certain individual only when they present their RFID card and/or password. While these types of advanced features enhance the physical security of the system, they also expose staff records and their RFID credentials to potential attackers, if the PTS system were to be compromised.
2. The PTS system supports variable speed transactions which, on the one hand allow for express shipment of urgent items, while on the other, enable the slow transfer of sensitive items, such as blood products that may be harmed if jolted too quickly within the tubes. If an attacker were to compromise the PTS system, he may alter the system’s speed restrictions, which can in turn damage such sensitive items.
3. The PTS system offers an alert messaging solution that may integrate with the hospital’s communication solutions, enabling the notification and tracking of delivered carriers, and alerting the PTS system’s maintenance crew to any faults in the system. Abusing these communications can interfere with the hospital’s workflows.

Lastly, compromising the PTS network can allow an attacker to control the carrier’s paths by acting as a man-in-the-middle, and altering the requested destinations of the carriers when a transaction request is sent to the PTS network’s central server. Combining one or more of the described primitives above can allow for a devastating ransomware attack to be unleashed. The attacker can either re-route carriers, derailing the operations of the hospital, or halt the system altogether. The most severe of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-37160) can allow an attacker to maintain persistence on compromised PTS stations via their unsecure firmware upgrade procedure, allowing him to hold the stations hostage until a ransom is paid.

While such an attack may ultimately be remediated with manual firmware upgrades of all compromised stations, such a process will take considerable time and effort. Hospitals don’t necessarily have any contingency in place to handle a prolonged shutdown of the PTS system, which ultimately may translate to harm to patient care.

### How Armis Can Help

Today’s healthcare delivery organizations operate on more than traditional IT systems and connected medical devices. There also exists secondary technology and machines that serve as the infrastructure which facilitates the continuous delivery of patient care. In addition to the Translogic PTS system, hospitals also rely upon elevator control systems in the context of patient movement, temperature control sensors for vaccine storage, gas control systems for suction and oxygen delivery and more. As these critical infrastructure elements connect to the network, they also become targets for exploitation.

Current security measures, including traditional endpoint protection and network security solutions are simply not designed to protect this infrastructure or identify these types of attacks. The Armis platform has been purpose-built to identify vulnerabilities like PwnedPiper and will help in the following ways:

* Armis can search for and identify the various components of the Swisslog system, providing complete visibility to the PTS elements.

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)

*Identifying Swisslog PTS Components*

* The discovered vulnerabilities will appear as CVEs in the Armis console and all the affected devices will be matched with the CVEs.

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)

*Matching CVEs to Discovered Swisslog Devices*

* Policies that detect exploit attempts of the CVEs can be created, alerting security personnel so that remediation steps can be taken.

Armis strongly recommends the use of mitigation steps outlined by Swisslog in their security advisory which can be [accessed here](https://www.swisslog-healthcare.com/en-us/company/news#publications).

### Technical Overview

As described above, the research yielded the discovery of nine critical vulnerabilities in the Nexus Control Panel that powers all current models of Translogic PTS stations. All current firmware versions of this device are susceptible to these vulnerabilities.

Swisslog has also acknowledged that older station models that are IP-connected (such as the IQ station) share code with the Nexus Control Panel, and are thus likely to be impacted by some of the vulnerabilities as well. However, these older stations are no longer supported by Swisslog, and will not get a patch released.

For the Nexus Control Panel, Swisslog is providing its customers a new version that mitigates the majority of the vulnerabilities – version 7.2.5.7. One remaining vulnerability (CVE-2021-37160) is currently unresolved by the latest version, and is expected to be patched in a future release.

This is a high-level description of the discovered vulnerabilities:

* Two vulnerabilities that are hardcoded passwords of user and root accounts, that can be accessed by login to the Telnet server on the Nexus Control Panel – that is enabled by default, and can not be turned off by native configuration of the system.
  + CVE-2021-37163 – Two hardcoded passwords accessible through the Telnet server
* A privilege escalation vulnerability due to a user script being run by root. By using the hardcoded credentials of the user account, through the telnet server, the user can leverage this PE to gain root access.
  + CVE-2021-37167 – User script run by root can be used for PE
* Four memory corruption bugs in the implementation of the TLP20 protocol as used in the Nexus Control Panel, that can lead to remote-code-execution and denial-of-service. The TLP20 protocol is the control protocol for all Translogic stations.
  + CVE-2021-37161 – Underflow in udpRXThread
  + CVE-2021-37162 – Overflow in sccProcessMsg
  + CVE-2021-37165 – Overflow in hmiProcessMsg
  + CVE-2021-37164 – Off-by-three stack overflow in tcpTxThread
* A denial-of-service vulnerability that is a result of the GUI process on the Nexus Control Panel binding a local service on all interfaces, allowing external connections to hijack it’s connection. This can allow an attacker to mimic the GUI commands versus the low-level process that controls the Nexus Control Panel, effectively accessing all GUI commands through the network
  + CVE-2021-37166 – GUI socket Denial Of Service
* A design flaw in which firmware upgrades on the Nexus Control Panel are unencrypted, unauthenticated and do not require any cryptographic signature. This is the most severe vulnerability, since it can allow an attacker to gain unauthenticated remote-code-execution by initiating a firmware update procedure while also maintaining persistence on the device.
  + CVE-2021-37160 – Unauthenticated, unencrypted, unsigned firmware upgrade

All of the vulnerabilities can be triggered by sending unauthenticated network packets, without any user-interaction.

For a detailed technical deep dive on the discovered vulnerability, read the [technical research paper](https://media.armis.com/pdfs/wp-Armis-PwnedPiper-en.pdf).

This research will be presented at the [Black Hat conference](https://www.blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/index.html#a-hole-in-the-tube-uncovering-vulnerabilities-in-critical-infrastructure-of-healthcare-facilities-23546) by Ben Seri, Armis’ VP of Research, and Barak Hadad, a researcher on Ben’s team, later this week.

#### Remediation Steps

While patching the vulnerable Translogic PTS stations is essential, external mitigations can also be useful for detection and preventing attacks on these systems.

Here are mitigation steps that can be used to identify and potentially block the discovered vulnerabilities:

1. Block any use of Telnet (port 23) on the Translogic PTS stations (the Telnet service is not required in production)
2. Deploy access control lists (ACLs), in which Translogic PTS components (stations, blowerd, diverters, etc.) are only allowed to communicate with the Translogic central server (SCC).
3. Use the following Snort IDS rule to detect exploitation attempts of CVE-2021-37161, CVE-2021-37162 and CVE-2021-37165:

   `alert udp any any -> any 12345 (msg:"PROTOCOL-OTHER Pwned piper exploitation attempt, Too small and malformed Translogic packet"; dsize:<21; content:"TLPU"; depth:4; content:"|00 00 00 01|"; distance:4; within:4; reference:cve,2021-37161; reference:url,https://www.armis.com/pwnedPiper; sid:9800002; rev:1;)`
4. Use the following Snort IDS rule to detect exploitation attempts of CVE-2021-37164:

   `alert udp any any -> any 12345 (msg:"PROTOCOL-OTHER Pwned piper exploitation attempt, Too large and malformed Translogic packet";dsize:>350; content:"TLPU"; depth:4; reference:cve,2021-37164; reference:url,https://www.armis.com/pwnedPiper; sid:9800001;)`

Other than these specific steps, hardening the access to sensitive systems such as PTS solutions, through the use of network segmentation, and limiting access to such devices through strict Firewall rules, is always good practice, that should be in use.

### Final Notes

This research sheds light on systems that are hidden in plain sight but are nevertheless a crucial building block to modern-day healthcare. Understanding that patient care depends not only on medical devices, but also on the operational infrastructure of a hospital is an important milestone to [securing healthcare environments](https://www.armis.com/platform/armis-centrix-for-medical-device-security/).
