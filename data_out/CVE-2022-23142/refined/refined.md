**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) issue in ZXEN CG200.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to its inability to handle a large number of HTTP GET requests.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can render the product management websites inaccessible by sending a large number of HTTP GET requests in a short period of time. This impacts the availability of the management interface, effectively disrupting the ability to manage or monitor the device.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a large number of HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to send the malicious HTTP GET requests. No special authentication or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability, and the attack can be performed from a network adjacent to the target device.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal testing by ZTE.
*   The affected versions include all versions of ZXEN CG200 up to V1.0.0P1N5\_M.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version V1.0.0P1N6\_M.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.5 (/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), which indicates a medium severity issue. The attack vector is adjacent, with low complexity, no privileges required and no user interaction needed, with impact only on availability.
