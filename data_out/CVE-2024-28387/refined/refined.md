- The vulnerability stems from a lack of permission control in the Axonaut module for PrestaShop. This allows unauthorized access to log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor):** The core issue is that sensitive information, specifically personal data, is accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Insufficient access control:** The module fails to properly restrict access to log files, leading to information exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Personal Information:** Attackers can download log files containing sensitive data from `ps_customer` and `ps_address` tables, including email addresses and full postal addresses.
- **GDPR Violation:** The exposure of personal data constitutes a GDPR violation, potentially leading to legal and financial consequences for affected users.
- **Potential for Malicious Use**: Stolen personal data can be used for identity theft, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Access to the vulnerable resource**: A guest can directly access log files via the URI pattern `modules/axonaut/`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privilege Required:** An attacker does not need any specific privileges or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** Exploitation does not require any interaction from the user.
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker with network access to the affected PrestaShop installation.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the Axonaut module up to and including 3.1.23. Version 3.2.0 contains a fix for this issue.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as high with a CVSS score of 7.5 due to the potential for significant confidentiality breach.
- **Mitigation:** The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to the latest version of the module and restrict access to the URI pattern: `modules/axonaut/`.
