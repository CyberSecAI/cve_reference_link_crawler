Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code in `dc_get_link_at_index` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/core/dc_link_exports.c` was not checking if the `link_index` was within the bounds of the `dc->links` array before accessing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** If `link_index` is greater than or equal to `MAX_LINKS`, the code would attempt to access `dc->links` at an invalid memory location. This leads to a read out-of-bounds vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The commit message states that Coverity reported 3 OVERRUN and 1 RESOURCE_LEAK issues, although it does not provide details.
- While the provided patch does not specify the full impact, out-of-bounds reads can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, data corruption, or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when calling the `dc_get_link_at_index` function with a `link_index` value that is out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `link_index` passed to the `dc_get_link_at_index` function.
- This likely involves interacting with the DRM/KMS subsystem and/or the AMD display driver, possibly through a malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix introduces a check `if (link_index >= MAX_LINKS)` to return NULL if the index is out of bounds, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read.
- The commit message mentions that this fixes issues reported by Coverity, indicating that this vulnerability was identified via static analysis.
- The patch also indicates that a resource leak issue was resolved by this change, although no details about how this is fixed was mentioned.
- The fix is present in both commit logs which shows that the fix was backported to the stable tree.
