Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Peering Manager application. This occurs because the application unsafely embeds user-supplied data into Jinja2 templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server Side Template Injection (SSTI): Allows attackers to inject template code into the server-side rendering process.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): The SSTI vulnerability leads to the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- Insufficient input validation: User input is not properly sanitized before being used in the Jinja2 template.
- Use of unsandboxed Jinja2 templates: Prior to version 1.8.3, Jinja2 templates were not run in a sandboxed environment, exacerbating the risks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server operating system.
- Full control of the server: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain full access to the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability: Impact includes high confidentiality and integrity risks, and a potential for denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- User input: The attack is triggered by inserting malicious code into a user input field that gets processed by the Jinja2 template.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- High privileges: The attacker needs to have high privileges, likely administrator or privileged user access to inject the malicious template.
- User interaction:  User interaction is required, specifically, an authenticated high-privilege user must input the malicious template code.
- Ability to reach the vulnerable application: The attacker needs network access to reach the Peering Manager instance.
- Understanding of template syntax: The attacker needs knowledge of the Jinja2 template syntax and its capabilities in order to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Peering Manager versions <=1.8.2 and is fixed in version 1.8.3, which implemented a sandbox for Jinja2 templates.
- Although the fix implements a sandbox, the documentation warns that sandboxing isn't guaranteed protection. Users are advised to always check code from other sources before using it.
- The provided documentation also points to other resources including OWASP guides on Command Injection and Server Side Template Injection as well as StackOverflow discussions on sanitizing user inputs.
- The CVSS score is 8.1, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
