# Remote Code Execution using Server Side Template Injection

High

published
GHSA-q37x-qfrx-jcv6
Mar 12, 2024

## Package

peering-manager/peering-manager
(git)

## Affected versions

<=1.8.2

## Patched versions

1.8.3

docker

peeringmanager/peering-manager
([docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

<=1.8.2

1.8.3

## Description

### Summary

There is a [Server Side Template Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/18-Testing_for_Server_Side_Template_Injection) vulnerability that leads to [Remote Code Execution](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) in Peering Manager `<=1.8.2`.

### Impact

Arbitrary commands can be executed on the operating system that is running Peering Manager.

### Suggestions

* Update to version `1.8.3` where a sandbox is used for jinja templates.
* As now mentioned in the documentation, sandboxing is not a guaranteed protection. Always check any code before using it in your instance.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
