Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-26066:

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code that is then stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and the attacker needs to trick a user to interact with the injected script (UI:R).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject the malicious script into the application, which will then be executed when a user interacts with the injected content. This typically means the attacker needs to be able to add content to the application.

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
