```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sprintf` function within the web server program `tdhttpd` does not limit the length of its third parameter, which is derived from the accessed path, allowing an attacker to provide an overly long string that overwrites the stack buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow due to unchecked string length passed to `sprintf` function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) attack. The stack overflow causes the `tdhttpd` web server to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the device's web server with a long string in the URI/path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically on the same network."
