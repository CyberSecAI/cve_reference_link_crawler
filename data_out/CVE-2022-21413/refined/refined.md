Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-21413:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

- The content from both `www.oracle.com` and `security.netapp.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2022-21413 as part of a list of vulnerabilities.
- `security.netapp.com` also specifies that the vulnerability is related to the MySQL server. This aligns with Oracle's April 2022 Critical Patch Update advisory, which includes fixes for MySQL Server.
- Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2022-21413.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

- **Root Cause:** The root cause isn't specified beyond "MySQL Server" but it relates to the DML component within MySQL Server.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The vulnerability lies within the Data Manipulation Language (DML) processing of the MySQL Server. 
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a "partial or complete DoS" of the MySQL server, meaning a denial-of-service where the server could hang or crash frequently.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is over the "MySQL Protocol".
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker requires high privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They must be in a network position to interact with the server.

**3. Technical Details:**

- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS v3.1 score assigned to CVE-2022-21413 is 4.9 (MEDIUM) with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability is present in `MySQL Server versions 8.0.28 and prior`.  This is explicitly stated in the netapp document. Oracle's documentation indicates the vulnerability could exist in products embedding the vulnerable MySQL version, requiring affected users to patch their MySQL version.
- **Netapp Products Affected:** Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows, Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere, OnCommand Insight, OnCommand Workflow Automation, and SnapCenter.
-   **Netapp Products NOT Affected:** A number of NetApp products which do not bundle MySQL server.

**4. Additional Information:**
    - The NetApp document mentions that they are aware of public discussions around the vulnerability.
    - The Oracle document is part of a larger critical patch update, suggesting this vulnerability is one of many being addressed in the same release.
    - Netapp indicates that the root issue is in the Oracle MySQL server, and a MySQL software upgrade may be required.
    - The Oracle document includes a large list of products affected, many of which bundle Oracle database products.

**5. Summary of Extracted Information**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw within the DML processing of the MySQL server.
*   **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of Data Manipulation Language (DML) within the MySQL Server, leading to potential server hangs or crashes.
*  **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS), with the MySQL server hanging or repeatedly crashing.
*   **Attack Vector:** Over the network through the MySQL protocol.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires high privileges on the MySQL server and a network connection.
