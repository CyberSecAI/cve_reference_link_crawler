## Embedded Reporting

Reporting turns data into the information your users need to make good decisions. Embedded reporting puts that information where users need it: in their applications. A complete solution lets users create the embedded reports they need. Now, you can
get all this in one embedded reporting tool.

With Telerik Reporting you’ll get a fully functional Web Report Designer that will help you to enable your business users to create, edit, style, view and export reports on their own. The reports can be easily embedded in any web or desktop
application.

Your involvement as a developer will be minimal – just in the initial stage of integration. Then business users can take the helm.

## Report Designers

#### Standalone Desktop Report Designer

Desktop based WYSIWYG report generation

The Standalone report designer, featuring an easy to use environment, is the heart of Telerik Reporting. It enables both developers and users to create, design, edit, preview, save, export and print ad-hoc reports seamlessly and without any code.

[Learn more about Standalone .NET Report Designer](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/standalone-report-designer/overview)

#### Web Report Designer

Web-based WYSIWYG report generation

The Web Report Designer allows editing of declarative report definitions. It features a WYSIWYG design surface with mouse and keyboard item selection, move and resize. New items may be added using a convenient Toolbox area. The designer exposes the properties of the selected items in user-friendly property editors customized for all different property types. The Report Explorer area allows easy navigation in the report structure and provides additional modification abilities.

[Learn more about Web Report Designer](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview)

#### Visual Studio Report Designer

Developer-centric WYSIWYG report generation

The Visual Studio report designer is specially created for developers that prefer VS for report authoring. It works with .NET framework type report definitions (.CS or .VB files). You can add and edit charts, tables and groups, fill them with data, calculate values, style, preview, share and export the ready reports.

## Report Viewer Controls

Created reports can be viewed in the most used report viewer controls, where we aim for the same look of the reports regardless of the platform:

* ASP.NET Core
* Blazor
* ASP.NET MVC
* ASP.NET Web Forms
* HTML5/JS
* Angular
* React
* WPF
* WinForms
* WinUI
* And more

Your reports can also be embedded in your application so you can display them directly on the form or page. The set of interactivity features are available in all report viewer controls that enables you to deliver a rich report environment without worrying about platform limitations.

# Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability

## [Description](#description)

* Telerik Reporting 2024 Q1 (18.0.24.130) and older.

## [Root Cause](#root-cause)

In ProgressÂ® TelerikÂ® Reporting versions prior to 2024 Q1 (18.0.24.130), a code execution attack is possible through an insecure deserialization vulnerability. In the case of CVE-2024-1856, this may also be possible to leverage remotely in a special set of circumstances in a misconfigured web application.

## [Solution](#solution)

Updating to at least version Reporting [2024 Q1 (18.0.24.305)](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/reporting/release-history/progress-telerik-reporting-2024-q1-%2818-0-24-305%29) is the only way to remove this vulnerability. Please visit the upgrade documentation [Upgrade Overview - Telerik Reporting](/reporting/upgrade/overview) and follow the instructions for the version you are upgrading from.

## [Notes](#notes)

* We would like to thank 07842c0e165d4d2d8733dd4eab48b3ed0f7afe38 working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for their responsible disclosure and cooperation.
* To check your current version of Telerik Reporting, there are two primary options:
  + If youâre using the REST service, you can visit the `/api/reports/version/` endpoint (e.g., <https://demos.telerik.com/reporting/api/reports/version>).
  + If youâre only using the desktop tooling, check **PC Settings** > **Installed Apps** > expand **Telerik Reporting** item for details.
* Our customersâ security is of the utmost importance to us. If you have any questions, concerns, or problems related to this issue, you can open a new [Technical Support](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/) case (Technical Support is available to customers with an active Support subscription).
