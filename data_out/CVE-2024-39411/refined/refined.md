The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that includes information about CVE-2024-39411.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from an improper access control, allowing a user to potentially perform actions they should not be authorized to execute.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation. Specifically, a user with lower privileges could gain the ability to perform actions or access resources that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack is of low complexity (AC:L) and requires a low privileged user (PR:L) with no user interaction (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U), indicating the vulnerability is confined to the component itself.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileged access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
