- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of PIMv2 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. This can be achieved using either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a PIM-enabled interface on the vulnerable device.
