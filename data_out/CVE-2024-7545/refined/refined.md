- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the parsing of STK command PDUs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account, potentially leading to privilege escalation and full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker who has already gained the ability to execute code on the target modem can trigger the vulnerability by providing specially crafted STK command PDUs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must first be able to execute code on the target modem. This indicates a requirement for prior access or exploitation of a separate vulnerability on the modem itself.
