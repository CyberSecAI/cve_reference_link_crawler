Based on the provided content, the following information about CVE-2024-50055 can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `bus_register()` function within the Linux kernel's driver core. Specifically, if an error occurs after `kset_register()` during the bus registration process, the private data structure (`priv` or `bus->p`) associated with the bus could be freed twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is a kernel crash due to the double free. This could lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered during the registration of a new bus. Any code path that can trigger a bus registration with an error condition after kset_register is a potential attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to trigger a bus registration that leads to an error after the call to `kset_register()`. This usually requires some form of privilege (e.g., root access) or a vulnerable driver loading path.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves setting the `priv` or `bus->p` pointer to NULL after the first free, preventing the second attempt.
- The fix was backported to various stable kernel versions, with slight variations depending on the specific kernel version (e.g., using `bus->p = NULL` instead of `priv = NULL` in some backports)
- The commits mention `commit bfa54a793ba77ef696755b66f3ac4ed00c7d1248` as the upstream fix for the issue.
- The vulnerability is present in the `drivers/base/bus.c` file.
