# Insecure SSH configuration for node and server containers

Moderate

[bartvanb](/bartvanb)
published
GHSA-2wgc-48g2-cj5w
Jan 30, 2024

## Package

pip

vantage6
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 4.1.3

## Patched versions

4.2.0+

## Description

### Impact

Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.

We will probably opt to completely remove the ssh option as it is only used for debugging. Later, we can add a debug mode where we can activate it if necessary.

### Patches

No

### Workarounds

Remove the ssh part from the docker file and build your own docker image

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-21653

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)
