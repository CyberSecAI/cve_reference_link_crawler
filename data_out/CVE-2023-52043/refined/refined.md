- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of whitespace characters in the WPA-PSK during synchronization between primary and secondary access points within the mesh network. The WPA-PSK string is truncated after the first whitespace character on the secondary access points.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Input validation: The device administration console allows setting a WPA-PSK containing whitespace characters.
    - Weak authentication: Secondary access points use a truncated version of the WPA-PSK, leading to a much weaker password.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized network access: An attacker can authenticate to the secondary access point using a substring of the actual WPA-PSK, potentially gaining access to the local network.
    - Denial of Service: Roaming devices may experience authentication errors and loss of network connectivity when in proximity to secondary access points because of the mismatched password strings.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Brute-force attacks: The truncated WPA-PSK is easier to brute-force due to its shorter length.
    - Password guessing: Attackers may guess the truncated password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range of the mesh network.
    - The attacker needs to be in range of a secondary access point.
