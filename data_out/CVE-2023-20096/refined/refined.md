- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a stored XSS attack, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts within the context of other users of the interface.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by entering crafted text into various input fields within the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX.
