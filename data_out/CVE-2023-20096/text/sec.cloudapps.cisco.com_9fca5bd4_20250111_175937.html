This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted text into various input fields within the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a stored XSS attack, which could allow the execution of scripts within the context of other users of the interface.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
