# HTML injection in Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab leading to DOM Clobbering

High

[krassowski](/krassowski)
published
GHSA-9q39-rmj3-p4r2
Aug 28, 2024

## Package

pip

jupyterlab
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.6.7
>=4.0.0,<=4.2.4

## Patched versions

3.6.8
4.2.5

pip

notebook
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

>=7.0.0,<=7.2.1

7.2.2

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability depends on user interaction by opening a malicious notebook with Markdown cells, or Markdown file using JupyterLab preview feature.

A malicious user can access any data that the attacked user has access to as well as perform arbitrary requests acting as the attacked user.

### Patches

JupyterLab v3.6.8, v4.2.5 and Jupyter Notebook v7.2.2 were patched.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround for the underlying DOM Clobbering susceptibility. However, select plugins can be disabled on deployments which cannot update in a timely fashion to minimise the risk. These are:

* `@jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to preview mathematical equations
* `@jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin` - users will loose ability to open Markdown previews
* `@jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin` (if installed with optional `jupyterlab-mathjax2` package) - an older version of the mathjax plugin for JupyterLab 4.x

To disable these extensions run:

```
jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/markdownviewer-extension:plugin
jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax-extension:plugin
jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab/mathjax2-extension:plugin
```

To confirm that the plugins were disabled run:

```
jupyter labextension list
```
### References

None

### Notes

This change has a potential to break rendering of some markdown. There is a setting in Sanitizer which allows to revert to the previous sanitizer settings (`allowNamedProperties`).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
