- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cgiserver.cgi` application improperly validates the JSON input provided in HTTP requests. Specifically, the code expects the `param` field within a JSON command to always be a JSON object but does not enforce this, leading to type mismatch when a string is provided instead of an object. This results in an assertion failure and a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an invalid JSON format, triggering a reboot of the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending an HTTP POST request with a crafted JSON payload to the device's `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to send HTTP requests. Although some of the vulnerable APIs require authentication, this can be bypassed using CVE-2021-44353 (TALOS-2021-1420) to make unauthenticated calls.
