- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page/post, potentially leading to session hijacking, account takeover, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By embedding a malicious shortcode containing unescaped attributes within a page/post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a "Contributor" role to be able to create/edit content containing the vulnerable shortcode.
