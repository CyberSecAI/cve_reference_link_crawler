# Ignition Release Notes

## Fixes, changes and features In Ignition

#### Select Version

### Version 8.1.33

Released October 19, 2023

Area
Change Type
Description

Alarm Journal

Alarming

Fixed an issue with database alarm journal configuration not accepting schema designation to be prepended to table names.

Alarm Status

Alarming

Fixed an issue where disabling and enabling an alarm would not generate a proper alarm event until the alarm goes into an active state.

Alarming

Fixed an issue where isAlarmActive() expression would return Bad\_NotFound qualities if an alarm was not active and gets re-enabled.

Build

Infrastructure

Updated OCI container image base from Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Designer

Swing

Updated batik library dependency from 1.16 to 1.17 due to CVEs.

Swing

Modified the Designer script console banner to display information useful to the user.

Drivers

Comms

Fixed a polling bug that caused `Bad\_NoCommunication` quality to remain after a device went offline until it was forced to reconnect by e.g. edit/saving the device configuration.

Comms

Fixed an issue causing failed writes to OPC devices to return "Good" statuses instead of "Bad" statuses.

Comms

Fixed an issue in the DNP3 driver which prevented frozen counter and frozen analog input values from updating when unsolicited messages is enabled.

Comms

Added a periodic background task to the BACnet driver which attempts recreating COV subscriptions that previously failed to be created or renewed. The rate at which this task runs can be adjusted via the newly added COV Subscription Retry Interval setting.

Comms

Updated Netty dependency to 4.1.54.Final to 4.1.97.Final.

EAM & Redundancy

Gateway Network

The EAM Remote Upgrade prep task can now be configured with a URL that points to an Ignition upgrade zip file. The zip file can be downloaded directly by agents instead of passing through the gateway network.

Gateway Network

One-shot EAM tasks can now be retried after task failure. The task is only retried for agents that failed.

Gateway Network

Gateway Network

The EAM Remote Upgrade task can now resume an interrupted upgrade zip file transfer, if the agent gateway also supports file resume.

Java - Azul

Infrastructure

The bundled version of Java has been upgraded to Java 17.0.8.

Launchers

Foundation

The Designer Launcher and Vision Client Launcher now perform stricter sanitization of launch command arguments. (Fixes ZDI-CAN-22028 and ZDI-CAN-22029)

Foundation

Ignition's bundled Java runtime is updated to 17.0.8

OPC

Comms

Fixed an issue causing writes to OPC tags through exposed tag providers to freeze and fail after a timeout.

Comms

Fixed ZDI-CAN-20499 (CVE-2023-39477), a possible resource exhaustion vulnerability.

Comms

Updated Milo OPC UA SDK to version 0.6.11.

Perspective

Perspective

Failover redirect to backup Gateway no longer fails when stopping master, if connected from same host.

Perspective

Added Gateway runtime parameters perspective.client.websocketChannel.maxIdleTimeMs and perspective.client.websocketChannel.idleCheckIntervalMs for advanced tuning of Perspective session failover redirect timing.

Perspective

Added new Google Map feature to Perspective that allows scriptable interactions and creating layers of Markers, OverlayViews, Ground Overlays, KML, Traffic, Transit, Bicycle, and Polygons (Circles, Rectangles, Polylines, and Polygons).

Perspective

Fixed issue where map geolocation was preventing following links to other views.

Perspective

Fixed gauge needle position when initial value is 0.

Perspective

Added loading screen message for new client creation and fixed loading screen layout on landscape oriented smaller displays.

Perspective

Fixed issue where filtered table columns were not displayed in the correct active state.

Perspective

Table view cells receive the correct `value` view parameter from encoded custom row objects.

Scripting

Scripting

Fixed an issue where the parsed return type description was not actually rendered in the script description popup.

Tag Historian

Tag Historian

Fixed an issue where Tag History storage wouldn't be accepted to targeted DataSink if matching Tag History provider didn't exist.

Tags & UDTs

Tags

Fixed an issue causing writes to Dataset tags through `system.tag.configure` with the "merge" collision policy to corrupt Dataset data.

Tags

Parent Data Types no longer flagged as a configuration error if their name matches UDT Instance.

Tags

Fixed an issue causing `system.tag.exists` to return true for empty strings.

Tags

OPC tags will now be in the correct state when a gateway from redundant pair assumes control.

Tags

Updated Tag Report Tool results to only display valid member results

Tags

Fixed derived tag references breaking when moving to a folder

Tags

Added JSON array coercion for array types. Users can now use methods such as `jsonGet` in array-typed derived tags to fetch nested elements of JSON documents in dependent tags.

Tags

Expression Tags calling runNamedQuery will now be evaluated on gateway start/restart

Vision

Swing

Fixed an issue where the Date Range Component wouldn't update the displayed selected range when changing from a smaller range selection to the maximum selection

Swing

Fixed an issue where the Vision Calendar Popup was not displaying correctly in multi-monitor setups

Swing

Fixed various issues related to improper 'case-folding' in certain locales (e.g. Turkish) causing dataset lookup by column name to fail.

Swing

Vision Tag Browse Tree now correctly populates the selectedPaths for DB Historian tags

Swing

Fixed unwanted autocomplete behavior in the dropdown component when it's in editable mode

Swing

Fixed an issue that caused an out-of-bounds error when viewing a components extension function script.
