The provided content describes a CSRF vulnerability related to user uploads in S/Notify for Confluence, which matches CVE-2024-23736.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the user profile pages of S/Notify, specifically in the functionality that allows users to upload their own S/MIME certificates or PGP keys. This also affects customer uploads in Jira Service Management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability
- Lack of proper validation or protection against unauthorized requests targeting user profile settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could upload a specifically crafted S/MIME certificate or PGP key for a targeted user.
- This could lead to email notifications being encrypted with the attacker's key, making them unreadable by the legitimate user.
- The impact is considered low because the user would quickly realize they can no longer decrypt their emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is initiated by the user clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website while logged into the affected application (Confluence).
- The attacker leverages social engineering tactics to trick the user into triggering the malicious request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that changes user profile settings in S/Notify.
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site.
- The attacker does not require any prior access or administrative rights to the application itself.
