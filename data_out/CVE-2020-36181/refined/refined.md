Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36181:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content, particularly from the `security.netapp.com` document, directly references CVE-2020-36181 as one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting NetApp products that incorporate the `FasterXML jackson-databind` library. 
  - The `github.com` document also confirms the relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a flaw in `FasterXML jackson-databind` versions 2.x before 2.9.10.8. It arises from the mishandling of interactions between serialization gadgets and typing, specifically related to the  `org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.cpdsadapter.DriverAdapterCPDS` class.
   - More generally, `jackson-databind` fails to prevent deserialization of objects from unsafe polymorphic base types.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Serialization Gadgets:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of classes ("gadgets") within the classpath that can be manipulated during deserialization to trigger unintended side effects. These side effects can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
   - **Mishandling of Typing:** `FasterXML jackson-databind` mishandles polymorphic type handling, particularly for properties with nominal type of `java.lang.Object` and related types (such as `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`). When using class names as type identifiers, an attacker can specify arbitrary classes and have them instantiated during deserialization.
  - Unsafe classes, that have side-effects (gadgets), can be instantiated
   - **Lack of Blocklisting (Initial):** Older versions of `jackson-databind` do not block known dangerous gadget classes from instantiation via the type id.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:**  Attackers could potentially access and leak sensitive data through the execution of malicious code during deserialization.
   - **Addition or Modification of Data:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to alter application data, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting the vulnerability can allow the attacker to cause a system or application crash, rendering it unavailable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Untrusted JSON Content:** The primary attack vector involves sending specially crafted JSON payloads by an untrusted client to a vulnerable server. These payloads include malicious gadget class names and property values which, when deserialized, would trigger malicious actions.
   - **Polymorphic Deserialization:**  The vulnerability relies on the usage of polymorphic type handling in `jackson-databind`, which causes the library to deserialize classes and objects, specified in the input JSON.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to Send JSON Payloads:** Attackers need the capability to send JSON data to the target application.
   - **Knowledge of Gadget Classes:** To construct a successful attack, an attacker must know of a valid "gadget" class within target system that can cause harm upon deserialization.
   - **Ability to Trigger Deserialization:** Attackers must be able to trigger a vulnerable deserialization endpoint.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

- **NetApp Advisory (NTAP-20210205-0005):** This advisory highlights that multiple NetApp products (Element Plug-in for vCenter Server, NetApp Cloud Backup, and NetApp Service Level Manager) are affected by a range of `jackson-databind` vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-36181. It emphasizes that successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure, data modification, or DoS.  It also mentions that NetApp is aware of public discussion of the vulnerabilities.
   - Also notes that fixes are only available for "Element Plug-in for vCenter Server".

- **Oracle's July 2021 Critical Patch Update Advisory:**
This document also mentions `jackson-databind` vulnerabilities, noting that  Oracle’s patch program periodically addresses third-party components like `jackson-databind`.  It provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability's impact -  “maliciously exploit vulnerabilities… for which Oracle has already released security patches”.

- **Github Issue (#3004):** This Github issue on FasterXML's `jackson-databind` repository confirms the root cause and lists the relevant CVEs (including CVE-2020-36181). It notes that fix was applied in `2.9.10.8` branch.
  - Mentions that issue "is a race between exploits and patches".
  - Also mentions some other reported issues stemming from this vulnerability, specifically targeting versions `2.9.2`, `2.9.6`, `2.8.11.3` and `2.7.9.4`.
  - Also points to blog post for additional explanation.

- **Blog post:** Blog post provides additional information on what is required for the vulnerability to be successfully exploited. It also outlines best practices to reduce vulnerability likelihood.

In summary, CVE-2020-36181 represents a serious deserialization vulnerability in `FasterXML jackson-databind` that can lead to significant security impacts including remote code execution, making it crucial for applications using this library to apply the necessary patches and mitigations.
