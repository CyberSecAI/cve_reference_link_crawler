# TOTP Token Stays Valid After Use

Moderate

[angrybrad](/angrybrad)
published
GHSA-wmx7-pw49-88jx
Jul 25, 2024

## Package

composer

craftcms/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0-beta.1, <= 5.2.2

## Patched versions

5.2.3

## Description

Craft CMS 5 allows reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times within the

validity period.

### Impact

An attacker is able to re-submit a valid TOTP token to establish an

authenticated session. This requires that the attacker has knowledge of the

victim's credentials.

A TOTP token can be used multiple times to establish an authenticated session.

[RFC 6238](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6238) insists that an OTP must not be used more than once.

> The verifier MUST NOT accept the second attempt of the OTP after the
>
> successful validation has been issued for the first OTP, which ensures
>
> one-time only use of an OTP.

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard v4.0.3 (ASVS) [reiterates

this property with requirement 2.8.4](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/v4.0.3/4.0/en/0x11-V2-Authentication.md#v28-one-time-verifier).

> Verify that time-based OTP can be used only once within the validity period.

It should also be noted that the validity period of an TOTP token is 2

minutes. This makes a successful brute force attack more likely, since the

four tokens are valid at the same time.

### Patches

This has been patched in Craft 5.2.3.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
