{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `loadTreeData` method in `org.jeecg.modules.system.controller.SysDictController` is vulnerable to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the `tableName` parameter in the `/sys/dict/loadTreeData` URL.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including user IDs and passwords. In some cases, it was reported that servers were compromised.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `tableName` parameter in the `/sys/dict/loadTreeData` URL. Examples provided include `tableName=sys_user`, `tableName=jeecg-boot.sys_user` and `tableName= jeecg-boot. sys_user`.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid token to access the vulnerable endpoint. In systems where registration is enabled, an attacker can register an account and obtain a token."
