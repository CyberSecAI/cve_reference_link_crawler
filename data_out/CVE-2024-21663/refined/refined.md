Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21663:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `prips` command within the Discord-Recon project's `app.py` file. Specifically, the user-provided input (the `argument` variable) was directly passed to the `subprocess.Popen` function without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By crafting a malicious input string, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code failed to sanitize the user-provided input before using it in a system call, leading to the command injection vulnerability.
- **Use of Shell=True:**  The use of `shell=True` in `subprocess.Popen` is a known vulnerability when combined with unsanitized user input because it allows the attacker to insert arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server with the privileges of the process running the Python script.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate data on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `prips` command, which takes user-supplied input as an argument.
- By sending a specially crafted argument to the `prips` command through the Discord bot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Discord bot that is running the vulnerable code and call the `prips` command.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `app.py` at line 160
- The vulnerable code uses `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True` and unsanitized user input
- A sample payload is provided: `.prips 74.125.227.0/29;ls`
- The fix implemented in commit `f9cb0f6` introduces `CommandInjection.sanitizeInput` before passing the argument to `subprocess.Popen`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by `Micro0x00` and reported in issue #23.
- The issue was patched by the repository owner `DEMON1A` in commit `f9cb0f6`.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2024-21663 and a GHSA identifier `GHSA-fjcj-g7x8-4rp7`.
- The advisory recommends updating to version 0.0.8 of ReconServer or disabling the `prips` command as a workaround.
