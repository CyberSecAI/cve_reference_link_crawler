| Summary The prips command in the Discord Recon project is vulnerable to command injection. It lacks proper input sanitization, allowing potential attackers to execute arbitrary commands through user input, which is then passed to the subprocess.Popen function.  Screenshot of vulnerable code  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/67539414/294825191-7c64cebd-dc1d-4b3d-b9c7-c6135aa055d5.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.3-dlhbJDisx2sSaWxD1zeFPZXJXkbUuNdRvbTVYHjnw) Bug Location:[app.py#L160](https://github.com/DEMON1A/Discord-Recon/blob/main/app.py#L160) Proof of Concept: An example payload demonstrating the command injection vulnerability is provided below:  ``` .prips 74.125.227.0/29;ls  ``` Command injection PoC [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/67539414/294828075-f334dd47-2662-475c-8e14-cdd11a748a09.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY2MTUxNDIsIm5iZiI6MTczNjYxNDg0MiwicGF0aCI6Ii82NzUzOTQxNC8yOTQ4MjgwNzUtZjMzNGRkNDctMjY2Mi00NzVjLThlMTQtY2RkMTFhNzQ4YTA5LnBuZz9YLUFtei1BbGdvcml0aG09QVdTNC1ITUFDLVNIQTI1NiZYLUFtei1DcmVkZW50aWFsPUFLSUFWQ09EWUxTQTUzUFFLNFpBJTJGMjAyNTAxMTElMkZ1cy1lYXN0LTElMkZzMyUyRmF3czRfcmVxdWVzdCZYLUFtei1EYXRlPTIwMjUwMTExVDE3MDA0MlomWC1BbXotRXhwaXJlcz0zMDAmWC1BbXotU2lnbmF0dXJlPTU4NmExMDM3NDQyZDM3ZGQ2NmU0Yjg1NWRlM2EzMjczZmUxNzI4MjVjOTFkNDUxM2Y5YzM4OTNiNGQ4ZWM0YjEmWC1BbXotU2lnbmVkSGVhZGVycz1ob3N0In0.V4f4TsVsBFu6SSP_O8gQZfbfvbBiqKICLyesU7aG7Zs) Impact If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the process running the Python script. This may result in unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on the context in which the vulnerable code is used. Recommendation To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the subprocess.Popen function. Consider using input validation libraries or sanitization techniques to ensure that only safe and expected input is processed.  Additionally, it's recommended to use subprocess functions that allow passing arguments as a list rather than a single string to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities. |

| I managed to reproduce the issue locally, It seems that I forgot to add the CommandInjection protection on the prips command upon updating the function, I'm going to drop a hotfix for this issue now. Thanks for your report |
