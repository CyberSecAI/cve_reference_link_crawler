# Insufficient Privilege Validation in NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14e8a81f8c7c18715d660025d52ce68a?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/john)   [John Castro](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/john)

* September 4, 2020
 ![WordPress Vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vulnerability-discovery_blog.png)

**Exploitation Level:** Easy / Remote

**DREAD Score:** 7.5

**Vulnerability:** Multiple

**Patched Version:** 4.3.18

[NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/#developers) is a plugin that  automatically publishes posts from your blog to your Social Media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Blogger, Tumblr, Flickr, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram, YouTube, WordPress, etc.

During a routine research audit for our [Sucuri Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/), we discovered a post deletion, arbitrary posting in social networks, and arbitrary plugin settings update affecting over **100,000** users of the WordPress plugin.

## Disclosure / Response Timeline:

* **August 24, 2020:** Initial contact attempt.
* **August 25, 2020:** Technical details sent.
* **September 03, 2020:** We contacted the WP team directly.
* **September 04, 2020:** Patch is live.

## Current State of the Vulnerability

It can be exploited by any subscriber and potentially by unauthenticated users once an attacker with a subscriber account changes the plugin settings. We are not aware of any exploit attempts currently using this vulnerability.

## Technical Details

Vulnerable versions of this plugin are giving access to several functionalities without using the proper restrictions — this can allow a bad actor to do the following:

* Remove Posts (by corrupting the post type and other data)
* Post Arbitrary Information in the site social networks
* Change the plugin settings

Here’s an example of a message sent by a subscriber to Telegram:

[![message claiming test post from vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nextscripts-vulnerability-message-365x650.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nextscripts-vulnerability-message.png)

Critical settings that can be activated:

[![user privileges and security settings for nextscripts plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nextscripts-vulnerability-settings-650x403.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nextscripts-vulnerability-settings.png)

An attacker can leverage multiple attacks by making use of all the functionalities provided by the plugin. We’ll provide more details in our vulnerability digest at the end of this month.

## Update as Soon as Possible

To protect against this vulnerability, we strongly encourage NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster users to update their plugin to version **4.3.18** as soon as possible. Users that are unable to update immediately can leverage the [Sucuri Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/stop-website-attacks-and-hacks) or equivalent technology to virtually patch the vulnerability.
