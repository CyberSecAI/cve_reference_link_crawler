| [@6543](https://github.com/6543) While I can understand the changes, I am pretty confused by the discussion that was done behind closed doors: <https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker-security> is a closed repo. Also, I couldn't find any approvals or reviewers for the PR. |

| The history of this PR is unclear. It was commited 6 hours ago and yet is in a released version of buildbot already. (As of writing this the CI hasn't even finished running). Can someone please clarify what's the purpose of this fix, why is it needed?  Sorry but we dont want bad acktors to attack users!  So we work serious security fixes in private, when time has passed all the information will be released. For now you can read the patch itselve and guess what to do. |
