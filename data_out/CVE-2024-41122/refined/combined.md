## Package

gomod

go.woodpecker-ci.org/woodpecker/v2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.7.0

## Description

### Impact

The server allow to create any user who can trigger a pipeline run malicious workflows:

* Those workflows can either lead to a host takeover that runs the agent executing the workflow.
* Or allow to extract the secrets who would be normally provided to the plugins who's entrypoint are overwritten.

### Patches

[#3909](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3909)

[#3934](https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/3934)

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

**Enable the "gated" repo feature and review each change upfront of running**

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[6543](/6543)** commented [Jul 14, 2024](#issuecomment-2227486059)

| ok I did go throug all the documentation and using `environment` in combination with `settings` was never showcased once and never mentioned either.  The plugin documentation is a bit lacking and can be improved. but based on our consensus to count changes of features we never have documented as non breaking, this is non breaking! 🎉 |

| FWIW, this broke my pipeline, do you have suggestions on how to migrate this to a working configuration? I need to set both environment and settings to workaround a drone compatibility issue:  ``` merge-docker-image-arm:   depends_on: [build-docker-image-arm]   when:     - evaluate: 'platform == "linux/aarch64" && UBUNTU_IMAGE == "ubuntu:22.04" && CI_PIPELINE_EVENT == "tag"'   image: plugins/manifest   failure: ignore   environment: &docker_manifest_env     # Legacy env var to prevent the plugin from throwing an error     # when converting an empty string to a number     PULLREQUEST_DRONE_PULL_REQUEST: 0   settings: &docker_manifest_settings_tag     <<: *docker_credentials     target: "something"     template: "something:${CI_COMMIT_TAG}-ARCH"     tags:       - latest       - ${CI_COMMIT_TAG}     platforms:       - linux/amd64       - linux/arm64 ``` |

| [@6543](https://github.com/6543) While I can understand the changes, I am pretty confused by the discussion that was done behind closed doors: <https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker-security> is a closed repo. Also, I couldn't find any approvals or reviewers for the PR. |

| The history of this PR is unclear. It was commited 6 hours ago and yet is in a released version of buildbot already. (As of writing this the CI hasn't even finished running). Can someone please clarify what's the purpose of this fix, why is it needed?  Sorry but we dont want bad acktors to attack users!  So we work serious security fixes in private, when time has passed all the information will be released. For now you can read the patch itselve and guess what to do. |
