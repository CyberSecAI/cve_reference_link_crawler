The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the vnote markdown editor.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vnote markdown editor does not properly sanitize user-supplied markdown content, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious code is saved in the markdown file and executed when the file is viewed.
- Inadequate input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided markdown content, specifically failing to escape or remove HTML tags.
- Bypassed XSS protection: The vulnerability bypasses the configured XSS defense mechanism (`"protect_from_xss":true`), indicating a flaw in its implementation or that the mechanism isn't applied during markdown rendering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Stealing of sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the application interface.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user creates a new markdown note within vnote.
- The user embeds an XSS payload (e.g., an `<xss>` tag with an `onclick` event) within the markdown content.
- When a user previews the markdown document, the malicious code is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create/edit markdown notes in vnote.
- No specific privileged access is required; this vulnerability can be exploited by any user capable of creating markdown notes.
