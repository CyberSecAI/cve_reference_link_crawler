{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the repair function of MSI installers, which can be triggered by low-privileged users, can execute under the context of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. Attackers can interfere with these repair functions through a visible command window that is briefly opened during program execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The main vulnerability is the presence of visible, elevated command windows during MSI installer repair operations.  Additionally, insecurely developed installers can create other vulnerabilities.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for privilege escalation because the attacker can interfere with the elevated process and gain SYSTEM level access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the MSI installer repair process.  Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that command windows opened during the repair process are briefly visible and can be interfered with. The attackers exploit the timing of these open windows.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the system with the ability to initiate a repair operation on an existing MSI installation. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the command windows opened during the installer repair process which could require some timing."
