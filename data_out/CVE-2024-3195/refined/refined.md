Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-3195:

**CVE-2024-3195:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when constructing file paths in multiple admin interface endpoints. Specifically, the `monitorlogs/download`, `monitorlogs/view`, and `index/todaypie` endpoints are affected.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used in file path construction, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory structure. This can lead to arbitrary file access or creation.
    *   Specifically:
        *  The `/admin/monitorlogs/download` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing arbitrary file downloads.
        *  The `/admin/monitorlogs/view` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing arbitrary file viewing.
        * The `/admin/index/todaypie` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing arbitrary file writes (though without control over the content).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the system, such as `/etc/shadow`, by traversing the file system.
    *   **Integrity:** Attackers can create arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack is performed through HTTP requests to the vulnerable web endpoints (`/admin/monitorlogs/download`, `/admin/monitorlogs/view`, `/admin/index/todaypie`).
    *   The `f` parameter in `monitorlogs/download` and `monitorlogs/view` is used to specify the file to download or view, and is vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   The `t` parameter in `/admin/index/todaypie` is used to specify the file to create and is vulnerable to path traversal.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to exploit these vulnerabilities, since they are located within the admin interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents indicate that the vendor has addressed this and other vulnerabilities with a patch, as seen in the merged pull request. The fixes involved sanitizing input, escaping special characters, and enforcing stricter path validations.
