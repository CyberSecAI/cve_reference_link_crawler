{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web interface session cookie is set without the HttpOnly flag.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The session cookie lacks the HttpOnly flag, making it accessible via JavaScript.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, able to inject arbitrary JavaScript into a page, can steal the `web_session` cookie. This cookie can then be used to log into the web interface, allowing for unauthorized access and control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, where malicious JavaScript is injected into a page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript into a page that interacts with the vulnerable web interface."
