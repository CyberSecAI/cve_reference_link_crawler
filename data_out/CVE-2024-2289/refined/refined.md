Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2289

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied data within the "PowerPack Lite for Beaver Builder" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly handle user-provided URLs in the link fields of various elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected through the vulnerable link fields. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed in the browsers of users who view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, allowing them to perform a wide range of malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser. This can include:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing session cookies and sensitive information
    - Defacing websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user
- **Compromised User Accounts:** By stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions, attackers could gain access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located in the "PowerPack Lite for Beaver Builder" WordPress plugin.
- **Link Fields in Multiple Elements:**  The vulnerability is present in various elements that allow link inputs.
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious payload is stored in the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress website with at least Contributor-level permissions. This level of access allows them to edit content, including utilizing the Beaver Builder page builder and injecting code through its modules.

**Technical Details from Code Changes:**
- **`bb-powerpack-lite.php`:** Version was incremented to 1.3.0.1
- **`helper-functions.php`:** A fix was made to call the function `FLBuilderColor::hex_or_rgb` properly
- **`frontend.php` (various modules):** The main change was to escape user provided URLs, using `esc_url( do_shortcode( $settings->[link_field] ) )`. For example, in the `pp-dual-button` module:
    ```diff
    -   <a href="<?php echo $settings->button_1_link; ?>" class="pp-button <?php echo $settings->button_1_css_class; ?>" role="button"<?php echo $target_1; ?><?php echo $nofollow_1; ?><?php echo $attr1; ?> onclick="">
    +  <a href="<?php echo esc_url( do_shortcode( $settings->button_1_link ) ); ?>" class="pp-button <?php echo $settings->button_1_css_class; ?>" role="button"<?php echo $target_1; ?><?php echo $nofollow_1; ?><?php echo $attr1; ?> onclick="">
    ```
    This change sanitizes the URL with `esc_url` before being rendered.
-   **`pp-heading.php`**: Media buttons were enabled by default for the heading description field.
  
**Summary**
The vulnerability allows authenticated users (Contributor+) to inject malicious scripts into various link fields within the PowerPack Lite for Beaver Builder plugin. This can result in a Stored XSS vulnerability. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.0.1 of the plugin.
