Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-25914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `collide()` function within the `object-collider` library. This function lacks proper validation of the input provided via the `arg2` parameter. Specifically, it fails to check if a provided property is an object's own property or if it resides on the prototype chain (e.g. `__proto__`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The primary weakness is prototype pollution. The `collide()` function directly assigns properties from the `arg2` object to the `arg1` object without validating if the keys are own properties or prototype properties. This allows an attacker to inject properties like `__proto__`, and modify the prototype of Object, leading to potential security issues.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks input sanitization or validation on the `arg2` parameter before attempting to merge it into `arg1`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting the prototype, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior in the application, potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, prototype pollution can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution, though this may require specific conditions or additional vulnerabilities.
- **Application logic manipulation**: By polluting the prototype, the attacker could potentially alter the behavior of application logic if it relies on specific properties not being present or having a specific value.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `collide()` function. An attacker can craft a malicious object with a `__proto__` property and pass it as the `arg2` argument to the `collide()` function to trigger the vulnerability.
- This attack can be triggered remotely, if the application is exposing the `collide()` function as part of an API or using it to process user-supplied data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the input provided to the `collide()` function, specifically the `arg2` argument. This could be achieved if the application processes user supplied data through the vulnerable function.
- **No required privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring specific privileges or prior authentication

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `src/utils/CollideUtil.ts` file. The fix involves adding a check to prevent merging the `__proto__` property.
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to pollute the object prototype by passing a specially crafted JSON payload with a `__proto__` property containing a `polluted` property.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.3 of the `object-collider` library.
- The fix is available in version 1.0.4 and users are advised to upgrade to this version.
- The severity score is rated as 9.8 (Critical) according to CVSS v3.1, highlighting the high risk associated with this vulnerability.
