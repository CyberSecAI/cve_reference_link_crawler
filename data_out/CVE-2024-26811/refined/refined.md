Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-26811:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of payload sizes within inter-process communication (IPC) responses in the ksmbd (kernel SMB daemon) module. Specifically, the `ksmbd.mountd` utility, if compromised, could return maliciously crafted IPC responses with incorrect payload sizes to the `ksmbd` kernel server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Payload Size Validation:** The ksmbd kernel server did not validate the size of the payload in IPC responses received from `ksmbd.mountd`. This allowed a malicious `ksmbd.mountd` to send responses with arbitrarily large payload sizes, which could then cause memory corruption.
- **Potential for Memory Overrun/Slab-Out-of-Bounds:** The absence of payload size validation could lead to memory overruns or slab-out-of-bounds writes when copying the payload data into kernel buffers, potentially corrupting kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption within the kernel, resulting in unpredictable behavior and system instability.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation/Code Execution:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code in the kernel context. Although not explicitly stated it is a common consequence of this type of flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised `ksmbd-tools`:** The primary attack vector involves compromising the `ksmbd-tools` package, specifically the `ksmbd.mountd` utility. A malicious version of this utility could be installed, which then sends malicious IPC responses when requested by the ksmbd kernel server.
- **IPC Communication:** The vulnerability is triggered through the IPC communication channel between the `ksmbd` kernel server and the `ksmbd.mountd` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromise `ksmbd-tools`:** The attacker would need the ability to replace the legitimate `ksmbd-tools` package, or somehow inject modified code into the `ksmbd.mountd` utility, such as during installation or an update procedure.
- **Access to IPC Communication:**  The attacker does not need direct access to kernel memory but only the ability to interact with the `ksmbd` kernel server via the existing IPC mechanism.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The patch introduces a new `msg_sz` field in the `ipc_msg_table_entry` structure to track the received message size.
- A new function `ipc_validate_msg` is added to validate the payload size of the IPC responses, specifically for the `KSMBD_EVENT_RPC_REQUEST`, `KSMBD_EVENT_SPNEGO_AUTHEN_REQUEST`, and `KSMBD_EVENT_SHARE_CONFIG_REQUEST` types.
- The patch modifies `fs/smb/server/ksmbd_netlink.h`, `fs/smb/server/mgmt/share_config.c`, and `fs/smb/server/transport_ipc.c` to validate the sizes of payloads.

This patch adds a check to validate the payload size of the ipc responses.
