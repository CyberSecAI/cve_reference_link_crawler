### Description

The WP Hardening – Fix Your WordPress Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Security Feature Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.6. This is due to use of an incorrect regular expression within the "Stop User Enumeration" feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and expose site usernames.
