The provided content is related to CVE-2024-32633.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a comparison of an unsigned value against 0. Due to the nature of unsigned integers, they can never be negative. Therefore, a check that attempts to evaluate if an unsigned value is less than zero will always return false, which leads to the issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code contains a logical flaw where an unsigned value is compared against 0.
- This leads to a condition that will always evaluate to the same result, bypassing intended logic.
- CWE-570: Expression is Always False

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The full disk test of eMMC will always evaluate the same way due to the flawed comparison.
- The impact is limited to potential incorrect test behavior and reduced availability, with a low impact on confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access (P) is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the device.
- No special privileges (N) or user interaction (N) are required.

**Affected Chipsets:**
- ASR360x
- ASR160x
- ASR180x
