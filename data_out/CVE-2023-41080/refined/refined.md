Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2023-41080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Tomcat handles FORM authentication within the ROOT (default) web application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Open Redirect:** A specially crafted URL can cause Tomcat to redirect a user to an attacker-controlled URL, which is a classic open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Redirection to malicious sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages or sites hosting malware, potentially leading to credential theft or system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted URL:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that exploits Tomcat's FORM authentication handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No special privileges needed:** The attack can be initiated by a remote attacker without needing any prior authentication or elevated privileges.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to click on the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
