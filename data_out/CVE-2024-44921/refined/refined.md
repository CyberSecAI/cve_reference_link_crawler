Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the `seacms12.9` application, specifically within the handling of the `ac=del` action. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` and `type` parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code uses the `$_GET['id']` and `$_GET['type']` parameters to construct SQL `DELETE` queries dynamically. Since these parameters are not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through these parameters.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible file and can be exploited without any prior authentication.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Manipulation/Loss:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to delete arbitrary data from the `sea_danmaku_report` and `sea_danmaku_list` tables in the database, potentially causing data loss.
    *   **Database Server compromise:** Using SQL injection techniques, an attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to other databases, tables and possibly compromise the underlying server running the database
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Depending on the database setup, attackers might be able to extract sensitive information using the injected SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `js/player/dmplayer/dmku/index.php`, specifically manipulating the `ac`, `id`, and `type` parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and requires no authentication.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs in the `删除_弹幕数据` function within the `sql` class where the `id` parameter is directly included in the SQL query:

```php
public static function 删除_弹幕数据($id)
{
    try {
        global $_config;
        $conn = @new mysqli($_config['数据库']['地址'], $_config['数据库']['用户名'], $_config['数据库']['密码'], $_config['数据库']['名称'], $_config['数据库']['端口']);
        $conn->set_charset('utf8');
        if ($_GET['type'] == "list") {
            $sql = "DELETE FROM sea_danmaku_report WHERE cid={$id}";
            $result = "DELETE FROM sea_danmaku_list WHERE cid={$id}";
            $conn->query($sql);
            $conn->query($result);
        } else if ($_GET['type'] == "report") {
            $sql = "DELETE FROM sea_danmaku_report WHERE cid={$id}";
            $conn->query($sql);
        }
    } catch (PDOException $e) {
        showmessage(-1, '数据库错误:' . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability by using a time-based SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter (`(select(1)from(select(sleep(6)))x)`). When `type` is set to "list", the injected SQL `sleep(6)` command causes a 6-second delay, confirming the successful injection.

**Summary:**

This content provides a clear and detailed explanation of a SQL injection vulnerability in the `seacms12.9` application. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization when constructing SQL queries, making it vulnerable to attacks.
