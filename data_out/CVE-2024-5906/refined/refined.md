- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious administrator can store a JavaScript payload via the web interface. This allows them to execute arbitrary actions in the context of another user's browser when that other user accesses the affected part of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. A malicious administrator can inject the XSS payload through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a malicious administrator with add/edit permissions for identity providers. User interaction is required as another user has to access the injected payload.
