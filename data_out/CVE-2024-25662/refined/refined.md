- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in Oxygen XML Web Author and Oxygen Content Fusion, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious URL is crafted and used as an attack vector. The crafted URL would inject unauthorized JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a user to visit the URL.
