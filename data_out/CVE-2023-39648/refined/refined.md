- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of SQL parameters in the `ajax.php` script of the "Theme Volty CMS Testimonial" module. The script has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a simple HTTP call.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection (CWE-89). The lack of input sanitization allows attackers to forge SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Obtain admin access.
    - Remove data from the PrestaShop database.
    - Expose sensitive data from tables (tokens, admin ajax scripts)
    - Hijack emails by rewriting SMTP settings.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks via HTTP calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
