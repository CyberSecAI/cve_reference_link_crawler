Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2023-3361:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the odh-dashboard handles credentials when exporting Elyra pipelines. Instead of referencing a Kubernetes secret, the system was directly embedding the S3 credentials in plain text within the exported pipeline configuration (Python DSL or YAML).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The most significant weakness is storing sensitive S3 credentials directly in the pipeline export, exposing them in plaintext.
- **Insecure Environment Variable Usage:** The system was using environment variables to pass credentials, which is considered insecure within Kubernetes environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:**  Attackers gaining access to the exported pipeline files or the pipeline code repository could obtain the S3 credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed S3 credentials could then be used to gain unauthorized access to S3 storage resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Exported Files:** An attacker could gain access to the exported pipeline files through unauthorized access to the filesystem, or if files are accidentally shared.
- **Compromised Pipeline Code Repository:** An attacker could compromise the pipeline's version control system where the exported pipeline code is stored.
- **Log Exposure**: Failing to create a Pod might reveal the credentials in logs, that are not protected by a secret masker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the system or storage where exported pipelines are located.**
- **Access to the version control system where pipelines are stored.**

**Additional Details (from GitHub issue):**
- The GitHub issue ([#1415](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard/issues/1415)) indicates the vulnerability is related to the `USER_CREDENTIALS` option when exporting Elyra pipelines, which is resolved by switching to `KUBERNETES_SECRET`. The fix replaces the storage of credentials as environment variables with a reference to a Kubernetes secret, which is a standard secure way to manage credentials in a Kubernetes environment.
- The discussion on the issue thread also highlights that storing sensitive information as plaintext values in the pipeline code is not recommended and the approach was changed to use the Kubernetes secret instead.
- The vulnerability fix was implemented in pull request [#1416](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard/pull/1416).

In summary, CVE-2023-3361 highlights a significant security flaw in how `odh-dashboard` was handling S3 credentials during pipeline exports, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information. The fix implemented the more secure `KUBERNETES_SECRET` approach instead.
