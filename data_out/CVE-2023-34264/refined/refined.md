- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the parsing of FPJ files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This lack of validation leads to a write operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious FPJ file or visits a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious FPJ file or a malicious webpage to the target user. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
