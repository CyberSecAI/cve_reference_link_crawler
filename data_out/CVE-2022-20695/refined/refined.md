```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper implementation of the password validation algorithm.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass vulnerability in the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software.
- Impact of exploitation: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass authentication controls and log in to the device through the management interface with administrator privileges. The level of privileges depends on the crafted credentials.
- Attack vectors: Remote, unauthenticated attacker logging into an affected device using crafted credentials via the management interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the WLC management interface and craft credentials to exploit the password validation flaw. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
