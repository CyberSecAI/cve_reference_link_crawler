Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The i-doit Pro v25 application is vulnerable to path traversal due to insufficient input sanitization of the `file` parameter in the `/` path. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `file` parameter, allowing directory traversal using sequences like `../` in the file path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server's file system that the web server user has access to.
* **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive information, including:
    * Configuration files (e.g., `config.inc.php`) which may contain database credentials and other secrets.
    * System files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    * Plaintext or hashed credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
* The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `file` parameter in a request to `/`.
* Attackers can use path traversal sequences (`../`) in the `file` parameter to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the i-doit Pro v25 application.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
