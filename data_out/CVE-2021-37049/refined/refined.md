- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Heap-based buffer overflow, allowing memory corruption by overwriting adjacent objects in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may lead to rewriting the memory of adjacent objects, potentially leading to code execution or other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified in detail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to trigger the vulnerability through some specific input or condition that leads to the buffer overflow. Specific capabilities are not mentioned in this description.
