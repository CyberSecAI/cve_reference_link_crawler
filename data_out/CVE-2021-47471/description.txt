In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload

The mxsfb->crtc.funcs may already be NULL when unloading the driver,
in which case calling mxsfb_irq_disable() via drm_irq_uninstall() from
mxsfb_unload() leads to NULL pointer dereference.

Since all we care about is masking the IRQ and mxsfb->base is still
valid, just use that to clear and mask the IRQ.
