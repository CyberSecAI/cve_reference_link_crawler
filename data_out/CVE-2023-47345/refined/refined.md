- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the UPF (User Plane Function) crashing when processing malformed PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) Heartbeat Request messages. Specifically, the crash occurs when the Recovery Time Stamp IE (Information Element) length within the PFCP message is mutated to zero.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the IE length within the PFCP messages. The UPF's parsing logic does not properly handle a zero-length IE, leading to a slice bounds out of range error, causing a panic and crashing the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a Denial of Service (DoS) of the UPF instance. An attacker can repeatedly send malformed PFCP Heartbeat Request messages to crash the UPF, causing disruption to the network service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the PFCP interface of the UPF. The attacker sends malformed PFCP Heartbeat Request messages, specifically with a zero length for the Recovery Time Stamp IE to the UPF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send PFCP messages to the UPF. The provided PoC uses UDP to send the malformed message. The attacker would need to know the IP address and port of the UPF's PFCP interface.
