## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Request a Quote < 2.4.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=request\_a\_quote\_settings&tab=tools
2. Add the payload `</style><img src=x onerror=alert(1); />` to the "Custom CSS" field
3. View a quote on the frontend to see the XSS fire

### Affects Plugins

Fixed in 2.4.1
