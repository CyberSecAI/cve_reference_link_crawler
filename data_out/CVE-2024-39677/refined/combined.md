# SQL injection vulnerability in discriminator mappings, static fields referenced in HQL, and some utilities

Moderate

[fredericDelaporte](/fredericDelaporte)
published
GHSA-fg4q-ccq8-3r5q
Jul 6, 2024

## Package

nuget

NHibernate
([NuGet](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anuget))

## Affected versions

< 5.4.9 & < 5.5.2

## Patched versions

5.4.9 & 5.5.2

## Description

### Impact

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in some types implementing `ILiteralType.ObjectToSQLString`. Callers of these methods are exposed to the vulnerability, which includes:

* Mappings using inheritance with discriminator values:
  + The discriminator value could be written in the mapping in a way exploiting the vulnerability of the associated discriminator type, if that type is among the vulnerable ones.
  + The current culture settings for formatting the discriminator value type could be altered in a way resulting into SQL injections with the discriminator values.
* HQL queries referencing a static field of the application.
* Users of the `SqlInsertBuilder` and `SqlUpdateBuilder` utilities, calling their `AddColumn` overload taking a literal value. These overloads are unused by NHibernate but could be used by users referencing directly these utilities.
* Any direct use of the `ObjectToSQLString` methods for building SQL queries on the user side.

### Patches

Releases 5.4.9 and 5.5.2.

### Workarounds

* Ensure the application does not use the features listed above.
* For discriminator usages, ensure the discriminator values in the mappings do not contain quotes for string discriminators. Furthermore, for types which `ToString` conversion can be altered to include SQL injections through adequate hacking of the current culture settings, either change for another type, or ensure the used values cannot allow culture exploits, or ensure the application performs sanity checks of the current culture settings. Types sensitive to culture include integers for negative values, dates, times and datetimes, floats and decimals.

| If we do that for mitigating some of the issues raised in [#3516](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/issues/3516), it should target the currently released minor instead, I realized. Even if obsoleting members in a patch release is not a normal practice with SemVer, when that is a security issue mitigation, it seems reasonable.  If instead the trouble is fixed at its root in the minor release, then we could keep on targeting the next minor, with another obsolete message. |

Fix SQL injections noticed in [#3516](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/issues/3516).

It does not fix wholly [#3516](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/issues/3516). Bugs noted in [#3516](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/issues/3516) that do not cause a security issue are not fixed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Other databases supports that escaping, but only DB2 documentation seemed to imply Unicode string literals were supported only by using it.

It would be nice if this code avoided multiple iterations over the initial value. The longer the value and more escaping added, the more expensive this operation could become. I would recommend similar changes elsewhere.

| I don't like this fix. In my opinion, every dialect should have a method to escape a string value for use in a SQL statement. This allows the mechanism of how strings are escaped to vary from dialect to dialect. Additionally, this alleviates the need for a flag as the default implementation of this function in the Dialect class can simply return the value as is.  For example, here is an EscapeString method that I wrote to escape string literals for MySql. Feel free to adapt the code as needed:  ``` public static string EscapeString(string s) {     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();      foreach (char c in s) {         switch (c) {             case '\0':                 sb.Append(@"\0");                 break;             case '\b':                 sb.Append(@"\b");                 break;             case '\n':                 sb.Append(@"\n");                 break;             case '\r':                 sb.Append(@"\r");                 break;             case '\t':                 sb.Append(@"\t");                 break;             case '\x1A':                 sb.Append(@"\Z");                 break;             case '\'':                 sb.Append(@"\'");                 break;             case '\"':                 sb.Append("\\\"");                 break;             case '\\':                 sb.Append(@"\\");                 break;             default:                 sb.Append(c);                 break;          }     }      return sb.ToString(); } ``` |

| ~~I would agree with [@deAtog](https://github.com/deAtog) that it would be better to delegate the escape to the dialect instead of introducing the configuration option.~~  EDIT: the implementation looks legit. |

This should not be a user configurable option in my opinion. The dialect should perform the all appropriate escaping where necessary. For example, your implementation for DB2 ignores this setting while always escaping back slashes for Unicode strings.

| I do not really understand your comment, deAtog.  every dialect should have a method to escape a string value for use in a SQL statement  My point here is that the base dialect shouldn't try to do anything.

Or would not escaping line feeds and the like still open injection vulnerabilities for them?  Personally, I don't know. I can see cases where certain control characters may cause problems. The handling of these characters is solely database/library dependent. Some may have issues, others may not. For example, one might be able to insert a backspace character into a string to delete previous characters or insert a null character to early terminate the string.  Also, while there *may* be a standard for escaping single quotes within a single quoted string literal, not every database escapes them according to the standard. MySQL, for instance, recommends escaping single quotes with a backslash, but supports the use of doubling the number of single quotes within a single quoted string literal.  I am not attempting to implement completely all the various escaping of all the supported databases. The subject is to remove a corner cases injection vulnerability. (There is very few uses of literal injection in NHibernate: discriminators, which are normally static values in mapping files, not application user data; HQL queries referencing static fields, which is a very little known and used feature; and some sql builder helpers overloads that NHibernate does not use and that we are going to obsolete.)  I'll admit, I don't know the full scope of this issue. Most of the above seem like cases where the injection would have to be purposeful. However, if there is a case where a user-provided value can be directly inserted into a query then I wouldn't leave anything to chance. In my experience, it's better to err on the side of caution than to assume a partial implementation corrects all the issues. |

This cannot be done in a patch release. (A throwing base implementation would not be acceptable either for a patch release.)  A base implementation that does nothing but return the value provided would be best in my opinion. This would allow the method to be changed to abstract in a future major release. This also guarantees that the base implementation does not break some obscure dialect. As is, there is no guarantee that the current implementation doesn't introduce a breaking change for **all** dialects.  This should not be a user configurable option in my opinion.  See the PostgreSQL case: it was supporting backslash escapes by default up to its 9.1 version, with an option to disable it. Then it has ceased supporting them by default, but it still allows to re-enable them with a configuration setting. That case can only be handled through a configuration setting on our side too, since we cannot assume which configuration will have the database, whatever its version. The user needs to be able to enable/disable the escape for PostgreSql according to its database configuration, if he uses one of the features relying on literal injection.  There's no doubt that a configuration flag is needed here for PostgreSQL. The problem here is that you've found a case where the dialect breaks the base implementation and have introduced a global flag to avoid a dialect specific issue, hence my recommendation above. Dialects are provided all configuration properties when the Dialect.Configure is called. My recommendation would be to only interpret the escape\_backslash\_in\_strings property from within the PostgreSQL dialect. There is no convention on where to define dialect specific properties, but I don't think defining it with all the other global properties is appropriate as it implies that it affects all dialects alike. I have seen many cases of cache specific properties that use a similar approach. Such properties are usually only mentioned in the documentation, but it would be good to have constants defined for them and a convention of where to find them.  For example, your implementation for DB2 ignores this setting while always escaping back slashes for Unicode strings.  Because its Unicode string encoding mandates backslash escapes, no matter what. So, that would be nonsense to follow the configuration settings. Such a setting is meant for cases where the user can know better what is the correct course of action.  That's exactly my point. From the context provided, the user has no idea whether or not the setting will affect the dialect they're using.  It would be nice if this code avoided multiple iterations over the initial value.  Sure. But I see this as just a nice to have, since the implied features are either very seldomly used, or, in the case of discriminators, usually very short.  My first course of resolution was to suggest banning all literal injections in favor of parameterization, which is the best way to avoid injection vulnerabilities. But some discriminator use cases where this could significantly lower performances were raised. So, now, I attempt a "good enough" fix instead.  Parameters would undoubtedly be better in my opinion, regardless of performance. There are many opportunities where performance could be improved, but now is not the time to address that concern. |

There's no guarantee that the implementation of this method won't break an obscure dialect that does not support doubling the number of single quotes inside a single quoted string to escape a single quote. While this is the ANSI standard, not all dialects adhere to that standard.

The only non-breaking thing to do here is to simply return the value passed.

Fixing a bug of lack of escapism is anyway behavior breaking for those which were compensating it by escaping values themselves (if anyone).

And from a security standpoint, better take the risk of breaking some dialects not natively supported by NHibernate rather than leaving the most common vulnerability (lack of doubling the quote) open for all not natively supported dialects.

Fixing bug is anyway always somewhat behavior breaking. That is normal and accepted for patch releases. That is binary breaking changes or source breaking changes which are banned by SemVer for a patch or minor release.

Mores specifically, from <https://semver.org/> :

> Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backward compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

(So, a new throwing base method causing previously "working in most cases" features to cease working is neither a binary breaking change nor a source one. But undoubtedly it does not qualify as "an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior".)

If I understand correctly, you are saying that in the case of a bug fix, it's okay to throw an exception for changes that correct behavior. Admittedly, I do not have a problem with that so long as the exception is thrown in the appropriate location. The changes here would cause an exception to be thrown once the statement is executed, not when the method is called. Any dialects broken by this change would therefore not know the root cause of the exception. Therefore, if you'd like to throw an exception in the base case instead of leaving external dialects vulnerable, that would be acceptable.

Alternatively, as already discussed, NHibernate could use query parameters to avoid escaping any values. It may not be as performant as the solution here, but it would undoubtedly be more maintainable and secure. It would also not introduce any breaking changes.

I'm not sold on necessity of passing the SqlType here. The primary purpose of this value is to determine whether or not the value to be escaped should result in a Unicode value. I would suggest one of the following:

1. Create a separate method called ToUnicodeStringLiteral.
2. Pass a boolean value indicating whether or not to return a Unicode string literal.

Admittedly, I prefer the former over the latter as it allows dialects to have different implementations if needed without a conditional on the boolean value provided.

ToString instead of cast does allow for some type mismatch in queries using static fields. That allows comparing a char entity property to a string instead of a char. The reverse fails due to the string type having a cast instead.

So, we have inconsistent behavior here. As that is not the subject of this PR, I leave it as is.

| [@hazzik](https://github.com/hazzik) Even if this were only for strings this is not ready for merging in my opinion. I have reservations about breaking non-ANSI compliant dialects with the changes proposed here. It would be far better to switch to parameters, regardless of performance impacts, than use what has been implemented here. NHibernate already suffers from quite a few performance related issues and the impact of using parameters here is irrelevant given their security benefits. |

That is still far from being a correct datetime representation for many SQL vendors and cultures. But at least, it does no more allow SQL injections. Granted, injecting through a very custom culture is a hard to exploit attack vector, even more with the unlikeliness of the vulnerable features to be used by applications. But after all, who knows how corrupted a computer culture might be?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Another fix for this case could be to use `ToSqlStringLiteral`. But it seems more lightweight to fix it like this.

I do not understand why is this returned as a string literal by the way. I would have expected it to be a int64 literal. But that is beyond the scope of this PR.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| While working with DateOnly and TimeOnly support I realized that the ObjectToSQLString method of ILiteralType is quite problematic.  **AbstractStringType**: `"'" + (string)value + "'"`   * SQL injection * No N-prefix for unicode (required in SQL server when the string is outside ANSI)   **AbstractCharType**: `'\'' + value.ToString() + '\''`   * SQL injection * No N-prefix for unicode (required in SQL server when the string is outside ANSI)   **AbstractDateTimeType**: `"'" + (DateTime) value + "'"`   * No guarantee that the stringified DateTime will be a supported datetime syntax   **DateTimeOffsetType**: `"'" + ((DateTimeOffset) value) + "'"`   * No guarantee that the stringified DateTimeOffset will be a supported datetimeoffset syntax   **DateType**: `"\'" + ((DateTime)value).ToShortDateString() + "\'"`   * No guarantee that the stringified DateTime will be a supported datetime syntax   **DecimalType**: `value.ToString()`   * Could very well be a decimal with the wrong kind of decimal separator   And there are more.  Since the method has access to the dialect, maybe more formatting should be moved there. |

| From my viewpoint, this method should be obsoleted and no more used. Building string fragments of literal values is a bad practice. Parameters should be used instead.  I can find three usages:   * To handle discriminators. I have neither investigated why does it not use parameters, nor how much work would it involve. * A seemingly unused `AddColumn` overload on `SqlInsertBuilder` and `SqlUpdateBuilder`: why not obsoleting these methods? |

| Using literal values in SQL does have some value. E.g. filtered indexes rely on the filtered columns **not** being supplied as parameters. And filtered indexes are really useful, e.g in scenarios where discriminators are being used. It makes it easy to create indexes tailor made for the sub classes in a class hierarchy. We use that functionality, and I'm certain others do as well.  We could probably "re-enable" such things with query rewriting if the literals were removed, but it's something to take into account. Making them into parameters is likely to cause performance degradation for some users. |

| At least with discriminators, the injection risk is very slim, their values being not dynamic but hard-coded in the mappings. Since NHibernate does not actually use those `ObjectToSQLString` for anything else (`AddColumn` being not used), the security vulnerabilities of their implementation is currently not practical to exploit.  Still, we should not let there security vulnerabilities there. If we cannot simply obsolete these methods and cease using them, they would have to be fixed. But I am not sure the dialects currently allow for robust literal SQL fragment generation. It may even be bound to the server or connection locales, like mdy vs dmy troubles on strings representing dates with SQL Server. (Which can be dodged by using an ISO format, but will we have this kind of solution with every vendor?) |

| I now see it is used in HQL too, for `JavaConstantNode`, `BooleanLiteralNode` and `BinaryLogicOperatorNode`. As I understand it, the `JavaConstantNode` may be used in case of a reference to a static field of a class in the HQL. `BooleanLiteralNode` should not have issues. And `BinaryLogicOperatorNode` uses it in case it has to resolve a discriminator, so, we are back to the discriminator case for this one. |

| It is hard to evaluate the impact of the flaw, since the vulnerable methods take an object as a value and do not, in most case, check it is of the expected type. So, with `DecimalType` (and most number types), if the value happen to be a string like `; drop database nhibernate;`, it will be yielded identically by the method current implementation.  The question is then, is it possible to get `DecimalType.ObjectToSQLString` called with such a value? Definitely yes with `SqlInsertBuilder` and `SqlUpdateBuilder`, since they expect both the value and the type as arguments. But that would most likely be a programming error. With `JavaConstantNode`, on principle yes too, since the class is public and can be constructed with a "wicked token". Otherwise that depends on `TypeFactory.HeuristicType(value.GetType().Name);` yielding the adequate type. With the discriminator case, that would be a very explicit programming error.  On Hibernate side, these `ObjectToSQLString` methods do not look to exist. I find instead [`JdbcLiteralFormatter<T> getJdbcLiteralFormatter`](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/6695617210b6a1abdd8930871db1b76f938d5f4c/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/type/AbstractStandardBasicType.java#L91C9-L91C56). |
