The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49971.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver. The `dummy_boolean` array, with a size of 2, is accessed out-of-bounds when `dml2_core_shared_mode_support` and `dml_core_mode_support` attempt to write to the third element (`dummy_boolean[2]`). This occurs when a pointer `hw_debug5` points to the third element, causing an overrun when assigned.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write
- Array index out-of-bounds

**Impact of exploitation:**
An out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption, which could potentially result in a system crash, denial of service, or other undefined behavior and potentially allow for privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `dummy_boolean` array out-of-bounds when the `dml2_core_shared_mode_support` or `dml_core_mode_support` functions write to `hw_debug5`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to trigger the execution of `dml2_core_shared_mode_support` or `dml_core_mode_support` functions within the AMD display driver. This likely implies a user with access to the display system.

**Additional notes:**
The provided patches increase the size of the `dummy_boolean` array from 2 to 3, resolving the out-of-bounds write.
