Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-2211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the T3 protocol within Oracle WebLogic Server. Specifically, crafted data in a T3 protocol message can trigger the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data: The core weakness is the server's vulnerability to deserializing data from a T3 protocol message without proper validation, leading to the execution of potentially malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to disclose sensitive information within the context of the service account under which the WebLogic Server is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over a network via the T3 protocol, which is used by WebLogic Server for inter-server communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication Required: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WebLogic server to be able to send the malicious T3 message.
- Network Access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WebLogic Server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 2020-12-04.
- Oracle has released a patch to address this vulnerability, which is included in the April 2021 Critical Patch Update.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 4.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
- Multiple researchers were credited for discovering this vulnerability
