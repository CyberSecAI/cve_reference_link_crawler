Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-23128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an "incomplete list of disallowed inputs" (CWE-184) in the FrameWorX server, which is a component of GENESIS64 and MC Works64.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the insufficient input validation when establishing communication with the WebSocket endpoint of the FrameWorX server. This allows specially crafted WebSocket packets to bypass the intended authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the authentication of GENESIS64 and MC Works64, gaining unauthorized access to the software. This can lead to unauthorized control and manipulation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, involving the sending of crafted WebSocket packets to the FrameWorX server. The server typically listens on ports 80 or 443 for WebSocket connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the FrameWorX server and have knowledge of the required specially crafted WebSocket packets. No prior authentication or user interaction is required, and the attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in a range of versions of both GENESIS64 and MC Works64.
- The JVN report specifies that this vulnerability allows a remote third party to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized control of the product.
- The CISA advisory also confirms the remote exploitability and low attack complexity. It specifies that this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the security of GENESIS64/MC Works64 when opening a communication channel to the WebSocket endpoint of the FrameWorX server.
- Mitigation includes applying security patches or switching the communication method of the FrameWorX server from WebSocket to WCF, isolating control system networks behind firewalls, and restricting network access.
