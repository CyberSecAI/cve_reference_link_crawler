Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-23128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incomplete list of disallowed inputs when establishing a communication channel to the WebSocket endpoint of the FrameWorX Server in ICONICS Suite and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 products. This allows an attacker to bypass the security mechanisms of GENESIS64 /MC Works64.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs (CWE-184)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- Unauthorized access to information.
- Unauthorized access to GENESIS64 and MC Works64 functionality.
- Potential compromise of the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- It has low attack complexity (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the affected FrameWorX Server (Port 80 or 443).
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
-   **ICONICS Suite** (including GENESIS64, Hyper Historian, AnalytiX, and MobileHMI): All versions from 10.95.3 to 10.97

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v3 base score of 9.8
- CVSS vector string: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Mitigations:**
- Apply vendor-provided patches.
- Implement a firewall and isolate control system networks.
- Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
- Avoid clicking web links or opening unsolicited attachments.
