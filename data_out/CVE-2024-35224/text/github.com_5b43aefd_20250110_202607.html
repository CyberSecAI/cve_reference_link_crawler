# Stored XSS in Cost Report Tables

High

[klaustopher](/klaustopher)
published
GHSA-h26c-j8wg-frjc
May 22, 2024

## Package

OpenProject

## Affected versions

< 14.1.0, < 14.0.2, < 13.4.2

## Patched versions

14.1.0, 14.0.2, 13.4.2

## Description

### Summary

OpenProject Cost Report functionality uses improper sanitization of user input. This can lead to Stored XSS via the header values of the report table. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments".

### Details

If a user configures a custom field with a malicious payload, then inserts that payload into a ticket, and finally runs a cost report -- a Stored XSS is achieved in the application.

By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS.

### Impact

If a Project Admin can pull this attack off, then a Project Admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin.

### Releases

OpenProject versions [14.1.0,](https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/14-1-0) [14.0.2,](https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/14-0-2) [13.4.2](https://www.openproject.org/docs/release-notes/13-4-2/) are all containing a bugfix for the security vulnerability.

### Patches

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided a patch for all affected versions. [You can download the patch here](https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/opf/openproject/pull/15631.patch).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
