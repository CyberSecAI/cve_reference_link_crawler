Based on the provided information, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `normal-bwdates-reports-details.php` file of PHPGurukul's zoo-management-system version 2.1. Specifically, the `fromdate` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `fromdate` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   They could modify or delete data within the database.
*   In some cases, they might be able to gain control over the database server, depending on the database configuration and privileges.

**Attack Vector:**
*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/admin/normal-bwdates-reports-details.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker manipulates the `fromdate` parameter within the request, injecting malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   They also need to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
*   The default admin credentials of the application are provided as "Username: admin Password: Test@123" which may provide privileged access to the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerable path is `/admin/normal-bwdates-reports-details.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `fromdate`.
