{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The driver was checking only for the number of endpoints, and not for the type of endpoint. This could lead to a warning in usb_submit_urb() due to the wrong endpoint type being used.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect endpoint validation logic. The driver was checking the number of endpoints, instead of validating the type of the endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The driver could attempt to use a wrong endpoint type when submitting URBs, leading to a warning in `usb_submit_urb()` and potentially causing issues with USB communication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious USB device can be crafted to have a wrong endpoint type, triggering the vulnerability in the driver.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect a specially crafted USB device to the target system."
