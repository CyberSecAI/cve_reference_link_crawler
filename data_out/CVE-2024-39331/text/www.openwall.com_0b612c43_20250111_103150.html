Subject: Arbitrary shell command evaluation in Org mode (GNU Emacs)

Hi,

Here is a vulnerability in Emacs Org mode.

Reproducer is the following .org file:

#+LINK: shell %(shell-command-to-string)
[[shell:touch ~/hacked.txt]]

When sent by email and previewed in Emacs or when opened in Emacs as a
file, the above Org file will evaluate "touch ~/hacked.txt" without any
prompts.

The fix is attached. It is against Org mode git repository.
The fix can be applied to older versions of Org mode/Emacs if deemed
necessary.

The fix has been included into Emacs 29.4 and Org 9.7.5 (released
yesterday).
