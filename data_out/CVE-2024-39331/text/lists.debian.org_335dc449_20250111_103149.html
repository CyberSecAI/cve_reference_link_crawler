Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3849-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : emacs
Version        : emacs 1:26.1+1-3.2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2024-39331
Debian Bug     : 1074136

A vulnerability was discovered in GNU Emacs, the extensible,
customisable, self-documenting display editor.

The org-link-expand-abbrev function expanded a %(...) link abbrev even
when the abbrev specified an unsafe function, such as
shell-command-to-string.

This could lead to arbitrary code execution as soon as an Org-mode
format file was opened, including one embedded in an e-mail message.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:26.1+1-3.2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your org-mode packages.

For the detailed security status of org-mode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/org-mode>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
