Hi!

Version 29.4 of Emacs, the extensible text editor, should now be
available from your nearest GNU mirror.  Emacs 29.4 is an emergency
bugfix release; it includes no new features except a small number of
changes intended to resolve a security vulnerability uncovered in
Emacs 29.3 and earlier.

You can find the tarballs here:

   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/emacs-29.4.tar.xz>
   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/emacs-29.4.tar.gz>

The tarballs are signed; you can get the PGP signature files at:

   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/emacs-29.4.tar.xz.sig>
   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/emacs-29.4.tar.gz.sig>

You can choose a mirror explicitly from the list at:
  <https://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html>

Mirrors may take some time to update; the main GNU ftp server is at:
  <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/>

To verify that the downloaded tarball is intact, download both the
tarball and the corresponding .sig file, and run this command:

  gpg --verify emacs-29.4.tar.xz.sig

(and similarly for emacs-29.4.tar.gz, if you download that format).

If the GPG command fails because you don't have the required PGP
public key, run this command to import the key:

  gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys \
    CEA1DE21AB108493CC9C65742E82323B8F4353EE

Alternative keyservers to try are pgp.mit.edu and keys.openpgp.org.

You can also run sha1sum or sha256sum and confirm that these
checksums match:

SHA1 emacs-29.4.tar.gz
324d1b39a1067261436e895a38c5f4992664ff72
SHA1 emacs-29.4.tar.xz
10758f7c0425a9fa328d84e060d2d2b25604929c

SHA256 emacs-29.4.tar.gz
1adb1b9a2c6cdb316609b3e86b0ba1ceb523f8de540cfdda2aec95b6a5343abf
SHA256 emacs-29.4.tar.xz
ba897946f94c36600a7e7bb3501d27aa4112d791bfe1445c61ed28550daca235

See the file etc/NEWS in the tarball; you can view it from Emacs by
typing 'C-h n', or by clicking Help->Emacs News from the menu bar.

You can also read NEWS here:

  <https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-29>

For the complete list of changes and the people who made them, see the
various ChangeLog files in the source distribution.  For a summary of
all the people who have contributed to Emacs, see the etc/AUTHORS
file.
