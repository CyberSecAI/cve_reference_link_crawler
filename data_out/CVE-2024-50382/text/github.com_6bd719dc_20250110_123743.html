```
The paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13489> claims that on specific
architectures Clang and GCC may introduce jumps here. The donna128
issues only affect 32-bit processors, which explains why we would not
see it in the x86-64 valgrind runs.

The GHASH leak would seem to be generic but the authors only observed
it on RISC-V.
