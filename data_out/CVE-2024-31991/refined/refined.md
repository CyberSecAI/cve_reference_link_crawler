  "CVE-2024-31991": {
    "root_cause": "The `safe_scrape_html` function utilizes a user-controlled URL to make requests to a remote server without proper validation or restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of URL validation.",
      "No restriction on providing IP addresses instead of FQDNs."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can map HTTP servers on the local network by observing the different responses (400 or 500 errors) depending on the target's accessibility.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user can make a POST request to the `/api/recipes/create-url` endpoint.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Mealie application."
  },
    "CVE-2024-31992": {
        "root_cause": "The `safe_scrape_html` function, while having a timeout to prevent DDoS, is not rate-limited, making it susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of rate limiting for requests to the `safe_scrape_html` function.",
          "Ability to send multiple concurrent requests"
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exhaust the CPU resources of the Mealie container and sustain network traffic to a target of their choice.",
       "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user can make a POST request to the `/api/recipes/create-url` endpoint.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Mealie application."
    },
  "CVE-2024-31993": {
    "root_cause": "The `scrape_image` function retrieves images based on user-provided URLs without proper validation, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of validation to ensure provided URL points to an external resource.",
       "No rate limiting on the image retrieval endpoint."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make arbitrary GET requests on the private network, map HTTP servers, and potentially retrieve files.",
     "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user can make a POST request to the `/api/recipes/{id}/image` endpoint.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Mealie application."
  },
  "CVE-2024-31994": {
    "root_cause": "The `scrape_image` function lacks rate-limiting and timeouts, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "No rate limiting for the image retrieval requests.",
      "No timeout enforced for image retrieval.",
      "Lack of chunking during content retrieval."
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker can cause the Mealie server to crash due to memory exhaustion or force the container to infinitely restart by requesting arbitrarily large files and potentially contributing to an external DoS attack by generating ongoing requests.",
