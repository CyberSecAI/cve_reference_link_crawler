{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A client-side commit aligned read requests to a server-defined rsize, potentially leading to out-of-bounds read requests on the server. When a client attempts to read from an offset near the maximum offset (OFFSET_MAX), the server may experience a loff_t overflow, which results in the server returning an NFS error code (NFS_ERR_INVAL).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The server's handling of read requests near OFFSET_MAX resulted in an overflow issue when converting to loff_t.",
      "The NFS client did not properly handle NFS_ERR_INVAL for READ requests, leading to infinite retries.",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking before converting offsets to loff_t."
    ],
    "impact": "A client could trigger a server-side error (NFS_ERR_INVAL) due to an out-of-range read request, causing the client to endlessly retry the request.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker would need to make a read request with an offset close to OFFSET_MAX on the NFS client."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send NFS READ requests to a vulnerable server.",
      "Knowledge of OFFSET_MAX."
    ],
      "additional_information": "The fix involves adjusting the offset and count values of the read request to ensure they do not exceed OFFSET_MAX. It also avoids returning NFS_ERR_INVAL for out-of-range read requests and instead returns a short result with the EOF flag set, which aligns with Solaris NFS server behavior."
