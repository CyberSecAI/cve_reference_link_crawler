Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of authentication and access controls for uploaded images in CodiMD when using the Filesystem upload backend.
*   Secondary root cause is the use of the Formidable library's insecure random filename generation, making it easier for attackers to discover file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication and Access Control (CWE-862):** CodiMD does not require authentication to access or upload image data. This allows unauthorized users to access any image if they know the URL or upload arbitrary files.
*   **Insecure Randomness (CWE-338):** The Formidable library, used by CodiMD, employs the `hexoid` library to generate random filenames. This library uses `Math.random()`, which is a weak random number generator, to create prefixes. It also uses an incrementing suffix. This predictable pattern allows attackers to guess or enumerate filenames of uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to any uploaded images, including those intended to be private.
*   **Data Exposure:** Private images could be viewed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can upload arbitrary image data, potentially exhausting disk space and causing a denial of service.
*   **Malicious Uploads:** An attacker can upload malicious images, possibly leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access uploaded images if they know the URL.
*   **Filename Enumeration:** An attacker can upload a file, determine the file prefix, and then guess the filenames of other files by incrementing the suffix and trying known mime types.
*   **Unauthenticated Uploads:** Attackers can upload files without authentication, facilitating both unauthorized access and DoS attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CodiMD instance.
*   **No Prior Knowledge Required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the CodiMD server to upload files and access the uploaded images

**Additional details from the content:**

* The advisory notes that the issue was discovered during normal application use.
* It provides specific curl commands that demonstrate how to upload and access images without authentication.
* It shows example code snippets from the vulnerable section of code, and the vulnerable library (`hexoid`).
