Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1352

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `rtcl_import_location()` and `rtcl_import_category()` functions within the Classified Listing plugin. These functions allow the creation of new terms (categories and locations) which should be restricted to administrators or other authorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The code lacks a capability check to ensure that only authorized users can access and execute the mentioned functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can create new category and location terms. This could lead to:
    - **Spam:** Creation of unwanted categories or locations, disrupting the website's structure or user experience.
    - **Defacement:**  Adding malicious terms to deface the website's category/location listings.
    - **SEO manipulation:** Adding terms to manipulate the site's SEO performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_rtcl_import_location` or `wp_ajax_rtcl_import_category` action hooks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerable functions are located in `classified-listing/trunk/app/Controllers/Ajax/Import.php`.
- The issue was present in versions <= 3.0.4.
- The fix was implemented in version 3.0.5 by adding a nonce verification check using `Functions::verify_nonce()`.
- The `create_term` function is used to actually create the new terms after the vulnerable entry points are hit, allowing attackers to control the name, slug, parent, description, meta, and child settings of the new terms.
