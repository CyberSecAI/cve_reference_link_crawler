Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Windows Network Drive Connector when using Document Level Security. Specifically, when permissions are set to explicitly allow write access but deny read access to a file, the file remains visible in search applications to the user, despite the user not being able to access the document via the network drive itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the visibility of the file in search results does not respect the configured document-level security settings.
- **Information Disclosure:** Even though a user is denied read access through the network drive, the file name and metadata are still exposed to them in search, which could reveal sensitive information about its existence and potentially its content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  Users can see information about files they are not supposed to have access to. This could involve filenames, and possibly metadata.
- **Limited Impact**: The impact is limited as a user cannot directly access the file content itself, only information about the file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Search Applications:**  The vulnerability is triggered by using the search functionality. An attacker could use search tools to find files they shouldn't be aware of.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a user that is authenticated against the system and has access to the search application.
- **Document Level Security:**  The vulnerability is triggered by document level permissions being set to explicit deny read and allow write.
