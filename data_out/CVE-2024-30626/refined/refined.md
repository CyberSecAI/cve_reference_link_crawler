- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setSchedWifi` function due to the unchecked size of the `schedEndTime` parameter from a POST request. The `strcpy` function copies user-provided input into a fixed-size buffer (`ptr`) without checking the input length.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow
    - Improper input validation of `schedEndTime` parameter
    - Usage of `strcpy` with an uncontrolled source and a fixed-size destination buffer

- **Impact of exploitation**: By providing a `schedEndTime` parameter larger than the buffer allocated for `ptr`, an attacker can overwrite stack memory. This can lead to:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or device
    - Potential arbitrary code execution if the attacker overwrites return addresses or other critical data on the stack.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/openSchedWifi` endpoint.
    - The `schedEndTime` parameter within the POST request is the attack vector.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device.
    - It is implied that the attacker has network access to the device to send HTTP requests.
    - No authentication is mentioned; thus it's implied that the vulnerable endpoint can be accessed without authentication.

**Additional Information:**
- The content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) script to exploit the vulnerability using Python requests and pwntools libraries.
- It also identifies the affected firmware version as FH1205 V2.0.0.7(775).
- The fixed size of the `ptr` variable is mentioned (25 bytes), and how the `strcpy` call with an offset of 10 bytes is causing the overflow.
